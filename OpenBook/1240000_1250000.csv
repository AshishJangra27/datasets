The contributions to this book, which deal with themes dating from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, tell of the intimate relationship between humans and the sacred within the walls of the home. The volume demonstrates that the home cannot be studied in isolation: the sixteen essays, that encompass religious history, the histories of art and architecture, material culture, literary history, and social and cultural history, instead point individually and collectively to the porosity of the home and its connectedness with other institutions and broader communities.

Reading Jesus: a writer's encounter with the Gospels,"Gordon, Mary",religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL14924307W?edition=ia%3Areadingjesuswrit0000gord,/authors/OL23368A/Gordon_Mary,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23080572M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Pantheon Books|Language English,"In the introduction to this remarkable book, Mary Gordon is riding in a taxi as the driver listens to a religious broadcast, and she reflects that, though a lifelong Christian, she is at odds with many others who identify themselves as Christians. In an effort to understand whether or not she had ""invented a Jesus to fulfill my own wishes,"" she determined to read the Gospels as literature and to study Jesus as a character.  What results is a vibrantly fresh and personal journey through the Gospels, as Gordon plumbs the mysteries surrounding one of history's most central figures.In this impassioned and eye-opening book, Gordon takes us through all the fundamental stories--the Prodigal Son, the Temptation in the Desert, the parable of Lazarus, the Agony in the Garden--pondering the intense strangeness of a deity in human form, the unresolved more ambiguities, the problem posed to her as an enlightened reader by the miracle of the Resurrection. What she rediscovers--and reinterprets with her signature candor, intelligence, and straightforwardness--is a rich store of overlapping, sometimes conflicting teachings that feel both familiar and tantalizingly elusive. It is this unsolvable conundrum that rests at the heart of Reading Jesus and with which Gordon keeps us in thrall on every page.From the Hardcover edition.

Flight of the Intellectuals,Paul Berman,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL2938694W?edition=ia%3Aflightofintellec00paul,/authors/OL448080A/Paul_Berman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL12338986M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 2010|Publisher  Melville House Publishing,              Melville House|Language English|Pages 299","Twenty years ago, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the assassination of Salman Rushdie--and writers around the world instinctively rallied to Rushdie's defense. Today, according to writer Paul Berman, ""Rushdie has metastasized into an entire social class""--an ever-growing group of sharp-tongued critics of Islamist extremism, especially critics from Muslim backgrounds, who survive only because of pseudonyms and police protection. And yet, instead of being applauded, the Rushdies of today (people like Ayan Hirsi Ali and Ibn Warraq) often find themselves dismissed as ""strident"" or as no better than fundamentalist themselves, and contrasted unfavorably with representatives of the Islamist movement who falsely claim to be ""moderates.""How did this happen? In THE FLIGHT OF THE INTELLECTUALS, Berman--""one of America's leading public intellectuals"" (Foreign Affairs)--conducts a searing examination into the intellectual atmosphere of the moment and shows how some of the West's best thinkers and journalists have fumbled badly in their efforts to grapple with Islamist ideas and violence.Berman's investigation of the history and nature of the Islamist movement includes some surprising revelations. In examining Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, he shows the rise of an immense and often violent worldview, elements of which survives today in the brigades of al-Qaeda and Hamas. Berman also unearths the shocking story of al-Banna's associate, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who collaborated personally with Adolf Hitler to incite Arab support of the Nazis' North African campaign. Echoes of the Grand Mufti's Nazified Islam can be heard among the followers of al-Banna even today.In a gripping and stylish narrative Berman also shows the legacy of these political traditions, most importantly by focusing on a single philosopher, who happens to be Hassan al-Banna's grandson, Oxford professor Tariq Ramadan--a figure widely celebrated in the West as a ""moderate"" despite his troubling ties to the Islamist movement. Looking closely into what Ramadan has actually written and said, Berman contrasts the reality of Ramadan with his image in the press.In doing so, THE FLIGHT OF THE INTELLECTUALS sheds light on a number of modern issues--on the massively reinvigorated anti-Semitism of our own time, on a newly fashionable turn against women's rights, and on the difficulties we have in discussing terrorism--and presents a stunning commentary about the modern media's peculiar inability to detect and analyze some of the most dangerous ideas in contemporary society.

Vicki Mackenzie, author of the bestselling Why BuddhismParenthood can be a time of great inner turmoil for a woman yet parenting books invariably focus on nurturing children rather than the mothers who struggle to raise them. This book is different. It is a book for mothers.Buddhism for Mothers explores the potential to be with your children in the all-important present moment; to gain the most joy out of being with them. How can this be done calmly and with a minimum of anger, worry and negative thinking? How can mothers negotiate the changed conditions of their relationships with partners, family and even with friends?Using Buddhist practices, Sarah Napthali offers ways of coping with the day-to-day challenges of motherhood. Ways that also allow space for the deeper reflections about who we are and what makes us happy. By acknowledging the sorrows as well as the joys of mothering Buddhism for Mothers can help you shift your perspective so that your mind actually helps you through your day rather than dragging you down. This is Buddhism at its most accessible, applied to the daily realities of ordinary parents.Even if exploring Buddhism at this busy stage of your life is not where you thought you'd be, it's well worthwhile reading this book. It can make a difference.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In its heyday, the ""San"" was a combination spa and Mayo Clinic. Founded in 1866 under the auspices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and presided over by the charismatic Dr. Kellogg, it catered to many well-heeled health seekers including Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and Presidents Taft and Harding. It also supported a hospital, research facilities, a medical school, a nursing school, several health food companies, and a publishing house dedicated to producing materials on health and wellness. Rather than focusing on Kellogg as the eccentric creator of corn flakes or a megalomaniacal quack, Brian C. Wilson takes his role as a physician and a theological innovator seriously and places his religion of ""Biologic Living"" in an on-going tradition of sacred health and wellness. With the fascinating and unlikely story of the ""San"" as a backdrop, Wilson traces the development of this theology of physiology from its roots in antebellum health reform and Seventh-day Adventism to its ultimate accommodation of genetics and eugenics in the Progressive Era""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This volume, the fifth in the Interreligious Dialogue Series, brings together historical, critical, and constructive approaches to the role of women in the dialogue between religions. These approaches deal with concrete examples of women's involvement in dialogue, critical reflections on the representation of women in dialogue, and the important question of what women might bring to the dialogue. Together, they open up new avenues for reflection on the nature and purpose of interreligious dialogue.""--Page 4 of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a result, we find that personal experiences, relationships, and stories provide more effective media for investigating spiritual realities than any essay or scholarly treatise. That is precisely the gift that the ten contributors in this book are giving us. Five of these contributors discuss how they have used faith to help others while five discuss how they have used faith to help themselves. Faith based upon real-world experiences serves to elevate belief above the quarrelsome and impassioned arguments that too often mark our discussions about mere religion. A gift we can give to each other is to provide frank descriptions of our own personal convictions and how we came to believe what we hold to be true. Our 10 contributors give us this window to view how they were lead to help others or themselves. HELPING OTHERS: Many of us wish that we could lead lives of service, and would prefer one day to leave the world a better place because we were in it. We may find no prescription in the journeys of these five individuals for how we can actually serve fellow human beings, but we will at least be encouraged by their clear and ringing testimonies that life at such a level is not only possible, but, when we are under the right influences, such a life of service becomes irresistible.Perhaps reading the accounts of these people’s faith will, itself, open a place and provide in your heart room for some of that compelling urge to service that has become so strong in theirs.  HELPING THEMSELVES:Many of us are on a quest for personal redemption of one kind or another. Abuse, compulsive behaviors, trauma, bad parenting, peer pressure, fear of death and a thousand other social pressures serve as albatrosses around our necks trying to drag us down to chaos and destruction. The concluding chapters provide opportunity for five contributors to describe how they discovered upward pathways towards the light through dark forces and circumstances in their lives. This is absolutely one book you must read. It will make you laugh, it will make your cry, it will give you inspiration.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

You can multitask like a pro--you prove it every day. But while you're used to being pulled in multiple directions, that doesn't mean you like it. You yearn for something more...not on your to-do list, but in the heart of daily living. Now Living Simply shows you how to make this ideal life your real life today! Joanne Heim's refreshing perspective and pointed guidance address specific areas you'd like to transform, from family and friendships to meals and celebrations. This book responds to the longings of your heart not with pat answers, but with practical solutions. Never have such simple changes yielded such sweeping results! Errands to run. Friends to meet. Laundry to fold. Dinner to cook. Messages to check. Calls to make. Gas tank to fill. Lists to do. Notes to self. Bills to pay. Dog to walk. Appointments to make. Schedules to keep. Lunches to pack. Party to plan.  Find Simplicity  Has busyness become your way of life? Is your calendar full to overflowing? Are you more focused on your to-do list than your family? Overcommitted to activities that send you in different directions rather than bringing you together?  You're not alone. And it doesn't have to stay this way.  It's not time to start over, but to start small. Joanne Heim offers hope for claiming the kind of life you dreamed of once upon a time. You'll discover how to choose less in this world of more, focus on one thing at a time, find ways to pull your family together rather than apart, and... enjoy true abundance!  [endorsements]:  ""This is the book I wanted to write, but was too busy simplifying my life. I laughed out loud and am provoked to action. Well done, Joanne.""  Lisa Ryan  co-host, InTouch with Charles Stanley, The 700 Club  author, speaker, wife, and mom  ""If you find yourself living a full life rather than simply living life to the fullest, this book is for you.""  Lisa Whelchel  bestselling author of Creative Correction, The Facts of Life, and Taking Care of the 'Me' in Mommy  Story Behind the Book""Simplicity is not just about cooking a month's worth of meals in one day or learning how to speed clean your kitchen,"" says Joanne Heim. ""Women long for a better quality of life, but we wonder just how to get it. In Living Simply , I ponder what it takes to slow down and downsize while living in a culture that supersizes everything from french fries to SUVs. I want more meaning and less stuff, and simplicity is a means to a better quality of life. Choosing this isn't about turning my back on the world or lowering my expectations, but about making wise choices and finding the abundant life promised by Jesus.""From the Trade Paperback edition.

Mendum|Language English|Pages 220,"ABOUT VOLNEY’S RUINS OF EMPIRES  Volney’s Ruins is a book of general principles. It asks the question: is there not a universal principle that explains the rise and fall of empires? Volney’s answer—empires rise if the government allows enlightened self-interest to flourish—not only represents a refutation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Social Contract. It also explains human history during the 200+ years since the book's publication: from the rise of the United States, to the fall of the Soviet Union, to the recent emergence of the Arab Spring.  Thomas Jefferson liked Volney's Ruins so much he secretely translated it into English. He saw the book as a means to teach future generations about the Enlightenment-based principles upon which the United States was founded. According to evidence discovered by Gilbert Chinard (1923), Jefferson was responsible for translating the first 20 chapters of Volney's Ruins, while Joel Barlow translated the final 4 chapters. Indeed, the first edition of the so-called Jefferson-Barlow translation, published in Paris by Levrault in 1802, is divided into two volumes: chapters 1-20 and chapters 21-24—an implicit recognition of the work done by two different translators.  FIVE GENERAL RULES TO PURCHASE A JEFFERSON-BARLOW TRANSLATION  (1) The first Jefferson-Barlow edition was published in Paris by Levrault in 1802. Hence, you needn't bother with English language translations published before that date. The first US edition was published by Dixon and Sickles of New York in 1828. (Here are two examples of what NOT to buy: James Lyon, Philadelphia, 1799 and William Davies, NY, 1796. To my knowledge, there is only one non-Jefferson-Barlow translation published in the US post-1802: see tag ""S. Shaw"" for more details.)  (2) Beware of editions published in the UK: 99 percent are not the Jefferson-Barlow translation. If you see the word ""survey"" in the title, that is a clear indication the book was published in the UK and is not a Jefferson-Barlow translation. (To my knowledge, there is only one Jefferson-Barlow edition published in the UK: see tag ""Hood & Cuthell"" for more details.) In general, it's best to look for US editions post-1802.  (3) If the title page includes the phrase ""translated under the inspection of the author,"" this is the Jefferson-Barlow translation.  (4) The Acid Test: turn to the Invocation: the first sentence should read: ""Hail solitary ruins, holy sepulchres and silent walls! you I invoke; to you I address my prayer!"" This is the Jefferson-Barlow translation.  (5) If you still want confirmation, go to Gutenberg.org. They have a free electronic copy of the (unacknowledged) Jefferson-Barlow translation for your comparison:  http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1397  Source: http://www.librarything.com/profile/ThomasCWilliams   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Mystery religions in the ancient world,Joscelyn Godwin,religion,First published in 1981,/works/OL2946081W?edition=ia%3Amysteryreligions00godw,/authors/OL449396A/Joscelyn_Godwin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3785179M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1981|Publisher  Harper & Row|Language English|Pages 176,"A lively, illustrated overview of the variety of mystery religions that flourished at the dawn of the Christian era. In clear, enlightened text and striking images, Mystery Religions holds up a “distant mirror” to our own times, showing that the quest for spiritual illumination from Eastern religions, and emphasis on spiritual development and experience, and a concern for hidden knowledge are deeply rooted in Western culture. Mystery Religions brings the myths, the magic, their rites and the wisdom of a bygone age to compelling life, making them comprehensible to modern readers. Godwin begins Mystery Religions with a crucial discussion of the five basic spiritual attitudes or orientations, one (or more) of which informs the religious conceptions of all peoples of every epoch. He clarifies the various paths—that of the warrior, of the monk, of the magician, of love, and of knowledge—and applies them in a detailed examination of the major mystery religions that follows. Here is a compelling account of the forms mystery religions took, from the cults of Mithras, Dionysus, and Orpheus to those of the Goddess, esoteric Christianity and Judaism, and Gnosticism. Godwin offers a rich and varied selection of illustrations; the symbolism of paintings, statues, reliefs, and other visual imagery provides a wealth of additional information about these religions. As in our day, the people of ancient Greece and Rome enjoyed unprecedented religious freedom and pursued their spiritual quest through a variety of cults, sects, rituals, and sacred studies. Mystery Religions explores this historical phenomenon from its wellsprings in the Eastern Mediterranean to its manifestations in such remote outposts of empire as the borderlands of Scotland. At the same, Mystery Religions distills those elements of man’s spiritual and intellectual growth which these religions embodied and which remain unchanged to this day.    —Publisher’s description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Do the right thing, of course— but better yet, find your inner light and doing the right thing becomes as natural as breathing. Here are ten powerful nudges toward that light.Drawing on sources from Zen stories and the Bible to jazz and rock 'n' roll, from American movies to Tibetan meditative techniques, Dean Sluyter steers clear of dogma and emphasizes what works— a sort of spiritual street smarts. He shows that the state of boundless freedom and happiness isn't something distant or exotic, but is right here, while you're stuck in traffic or taking out the trash. And revisiting the Ten Commandments, he shows how on a deeper level they offer some surprising enlightenment wisdom of their own.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the philosophical perspective of the Frankfurt School?s critical theory, this book attempts not only to diagnose the current problems stemming from a marginalization of Islam in the secular West, but also to offer a proposal for a Habermasian discourse between the religious and the secular. By highlighting historical examples of Islamic and western rapprochement, and rejecting the ?clash of civilization? thesis, the author attempts to find a ?common language? between the religious and the secular, which can serve as a vehicle for a future reconciliation.

It's the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God's call to recognize that we're really nothing without Him. It's pride versus humility. And it's a fight we can't win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His thorough examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God's abundant favor. ""This is the one to whom I will look:  he who is humble and contrite in spirit.""  --Isaiah 66:2, esv  God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He's also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated.  Which will you pursue?  C. J. Mahaney paints a striking picture of the daily battle quietly raging within every Christian and asks whether you will passively accommodate the enemy of your soul, pride, or actively cultivate your best friend, humility. When you acknowledge the deception of pride and intentionally humble yourself, you become free to savor abundant mercies and unlikely graces. You will find a new life is yours--a life God richly favors. A God-glorifying life you don't want to miss.  ""C. J. Mahaney is not humble. At least, that's what he'll tell you. And that's one reason he's so well qualified to write this book.""  Mark E. Dever  Senior pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church  Author, Nine Marks of a Healthy Church  ""A much-needed wake-up call on this important subject. I highly recommend this book.""  Jerry Bridges  Author of The Pursuit of Holiness  ""This is the right book from the right man at the right time.""  R. Albert Mohler, Jr.  President, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Story Behind the Book""Given pride's pervasive presence in my life, I come to this book in holy fear, yet inspired by God's promises to be humble and sobered by his warnings to the proud (Isaiah 66:2b, 1 Peter 5:5b). Scripture reveals to us that, while pride was the first and most serious sin, God is decisively drawn to humility and is specifically supportive of the humble. Only Christ has fully obeyed Isaiah 66:2b (""This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word""), yet He did so as our representative! How marvelous that in our daily battle against pride we can rely on God's grace, through the gospel, and thus bring honor and glory to God."" --C. J. MahaneyFrom the Hardcover edition.

Other times, it is a red flashing light that protects. Often, it's a spotlight that exposes your need. And since you are called to walk by faith, you need light--in all its various forms--guiding your steps. Jennifer Rothschild 's path, darkened by physical blindness, is illuminated by scriptural truth. And now she shares the keys to persevering and ""clinging to the Sword"" no matter what your circumstances. Lessons I Learned in the Light is a powerful collection of Scripture, intriguing autobiographical sketches, and pointed Bible study with personal, practical application questions that will encourage you every step of the way. ""Your word is a lamp unto my feet,  and a light unto my path.""  Psalm 119:105  Have you known darkness? Are you there even now? There is a ray of hope that brings clarity and guidance: God's Word--the Light that is better than life. And it wields the power to see you through absolutely anything.  Jennifer Rothschild , in her physical blindness, found the secret to persevering with endurance and shares it candidly. No matter what you face today, Lessons I Learned in the Light will help you:   cling to His Word carry no baggage pray like crazy be God-conscious enjoy the fish bowl  No matter how dark the road, you can travel it courageously, secure in the Light. ""For these commands and this teaching are a lamp to light the way ahead of you"" (Proverbs 6:23 , NLT).  ""Jennifer Rothschild is a sincere and transparent example of what it means to press toward the goal--to live a thriving, courageous life in Christ.""  Sara Groves  Singer/songwriter  ""Like the Renaissance artists of old, Jennifer Rothschild sees with her heart. Through self-discipline, acute observation, and Christ centeredness, the tapestry of her life has been woven together by an unshakeable faith.""  Luci SwindollAuthor and speaker, Women of Faith  ""Her gentle, pleasing style first draws readers in and captures their imaginations. Only then does she deliver her more powerful punches.""  Publishers Weekly  Story Behind the Book""I don't have the privilege of reading God's Word in the traditional sense, but I still rely on it as my source of power--power to persevere and thrive in a world of darkness. Without it, I would have quit a long time ago. Proverbs 6:23 says 'These commands and this teaching are a lamp to light the way ahead of you' (NLT). While Lessons I Learned in the Dark provided principles for walking by faith, Lessons I Learned in the Light offers fuel for running with endurance.""  -- Jennifer RothschildFrom the Trade Paperback edition.

Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa (Volume 2),David Livingstone,religion,First published in 2001,/works/OL8148139W,/authors/OL2716269A/David_Livingstone,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8843784M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 2001|Publisher  Stackpole Books,              The Narrative Press|Language English|Pages 395","When Missionary Travels was first published in 1857, reviewers noted that the existing ideas about south central Africa would have to undergo a radical transformation. Land thought to be dry and mountainous was discovered to be fertile grassland with a wide variety of animal life, and the peoples that lived there, while sometimes suspicious, were often welcoming to an outsider. And great rivers existed as well; the Zambesi River was unknown to Europeans until Livingstone's visit.Dr. David Livingstone had lived in Africa for a number of years when he undertook the journey he writes about in this book. It is a remarkable story, told without self-aggrandizement. Livingstone walked over 4,000 miles, from Cape Town, South Africa through the Kalahari Desert to the coastal town of Loanda (now Luanda, Angola), and back along the Zambesi River to the east coast of Mozambique. Only members of the Makololo tribe, with whom he had established a firm friendship, accompanied him. His mission was to stop the slave trade.Livingstone begins the book with a brief overview of his personal life that reveals a fierce determination: he learned Latin, Greek, medicine and theology while still employed as a cotton-spinner in a Scottish mill. He had hoped to go to China as a missionary but went to Africa instead, and he describes some of his early experiences there. Livingstone pushed through the Kalahari Desert and the savannas and travelled along the Zambesi river. Eventually he came to the falls known by the natives as ""Mosi oa tunya"" (""smoke does sound there"") and which he named ""Victoria"":""After twenty minutes' sail from Kalai we came in sight, for the first time, of the columns of vapor appropriately called ""smoke"", rising at a distance of five or six miles, exactly as when large tracts of grass are burned in Africa. Five columns now arose, and, bending in the direction of the wind, they seemed placed against a low ridge covered with trees; the tops of the columns at this distance appeared to mingle with the clouds. They were white below, and higher up became dark, so as to simulate smoke very closely. The whole scene was extremely beautiful; the banks and islands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan vegetation of great variety of color and form. At the period of our visit several trees were spangled over with blossoms…It had never been seen before by European eyes; but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight.""He encountered a variety of peoples including both the nomadic Bushmen and the Bakalahari with their enormous herds, and he includes numerous descriptions of terrain and animal life. Sensitive descriptions of indigenous religious practices and customs also abound, and Livingstone assesses people and situations without romanticizing them. This is an important book, and reading it helps us to understand not only the Africa of the past but of the present.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the answers they can't find anywhere else, they look to the spiritual world. But most have never been touched by an angel, and few have the patience for sweat lodges, the stamina to climb the Himalayas, or the fashion sense to wear crystals. It's one thing to draw inspiration from the books in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, but quite another to become a spiritual person through one's own deeds. For these interested yet wary people comes the perfectly accessible program of 30 Days to a More Spiritual Life. This simple guidebook is designed to help readers find personal, comprehensible ways to tap into their spirituality in every aspect of daily life. Growing closer to God (or whatever Higher Power) means communicating not only through prayer and meditation but also through understanding and appreciating one's self and one's world. 30 Days to a More Spiritual Life guides readers toward creating holy moments in the day and discovering their spiritual sides in interactions with others, in conducting business, and even in expressing love. Based on Shana Aborn's very popular article on the same subject for Ladies' Home Journal, 30 Days will incorporate personal anecdotes from the men and women who have benefited from the 30 Day program. This plan will have people of all faiths, backgrounds, and experiences on the road to serenity, greater well-being, and renewed sense of purpose right from the first page.From the Hardcover edition.

Submitted from writers throughout the world, these stories touch on the synchronicity of Universal intervention which unites a cat with their person.As you enjoy these stories, possibly a new perspective of your own cat’s special qualities may become evident.  Your feline’s life has not gone unnoticed, for you have been a living testament to the delight and enchantment they have brought into your family.  Every cat does indeed have a story, a moment and a legacy that touches their owner’s world in a significant manner.A sampling of the 16 stories includes: “The Blue Angel & Her Garden of Pets”, one man’s connection to feline spirituality which ultimately connects us one to the other.  “Finding Karma at the SPCA” is a story of Universal destiny in which a cat immediately recognizes her owner, yet neither had ever met before.  “My Cat is So Insolent, She Has A Price on Her Head”, is written with a dry sense of humor exploring the “what ifs” of a cat lover and her lessons learned.  “Caterina, Portrait of a Feline Soul Mate”, is the kitten we all seek but would we have the awareness to recognize her in a room full of kittens?  Then again, would she recognize us?  This is an intriguing, educational and entertaining collection of cat stories that you may fondly recall during those private moments shared only with your cat.About the Author:Jasmine Kinnear has been active in the world of cats for many years as a writer, Feline Behavior Consultant, registered cat breeder and cattery mentor.  Her distinctive ability to think just like a cat has permitted her to assist others in better understanding their felines’ unique spiritual nature.She is now embarking on a new path and requesting others to also share their stories to honor the special people and/or pets within their own lives.  Her compassion, sensitivity and understanding of the human condition lends itself to the “Every Story” series of books.  “Every Cat Has A Story” is Jasmine Kinnear’s third book.

How Africa Shaped the Christian Mind: Rediscovering the African Seedbed of Western Christianity,Thomas C.

Some of the most decisive intellectual achievements of Christianity were explored and understood in Africa before they were in Europe. If this is so, why is Christianity so often perceived in Africa as a Western colonial import? How can Christians in Northern and sub-Saharan Africa, indeed how can Christians throughout the world, rediscover and learn from this ancient heritage? Theologian Thomas C. Oden offers a portrait that challenges prevailing notions of the intellectual development of Christianity from its early roots to its modern expressions. The pattern, he suggests, is not from north to south from Europe to Africa, but the other way around. He then makes an impassioned plea to uncover the hard data and study in depth the vital role that early African Christians played in developing the modern university, maturing Christian exegesis of Scripture, shaping early Christian dogma, modeling conciliar patterns of ecumenical decision-making, stimulating early monasticism, developing Neoplatonism, and refining rhetorical and dialectical skills. He calls for a wide-ranging research project to fill out the picture he sketches. It will require, he says, a generation of disciplined investigation, combining intensive language study with a risk-taking commitment to uncover the truth in potentially unreceptive environments. Oden envisions a dedicated consortium of scholars linked by computer technology and a common commitment that will seek to shape not only the scholar's understanding but the ordinary African Christian's self-perception. - Publisher.

The cosmic dance,"Del Re, Giuseppe",religion,First published in 1999,/works/OL475361W?edition=ia%3Acosmicdancescien0000delr,/authors/OL28687A/Del_Re_Giuseppe,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL43864M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Templeton Foundation Press|Language English,"This book focuses on a new worldview, emerging from the science of the last decades of the second millennium. Its metaphor is the cosmic dance, or the harmony existing between systems that are so strongly interdependent that they behave as a single entity. This dance image hints at a general, evolving pattern in which all objects in the universe participate—like the ordered chaos of an African open-air market.Some of the chapters discuss the nature of processes in the universe, including chaos and chance in the game of life. The reconciliation of variety and unity are addressed in reference to the space-time continuum and the unified field of relativity theory. Del Re continues the investigation into an exploration of the origins of freedom and ethics, suggesting that science indicates that the human species may have a specific task in the universe: building a bridge between matter and spirit. Del Re ponders alchemy, the significance of symbols, and the meaning of the soul. Woven throughout a variety of esoteric and scientific inquiries is the underlying sense of the unifying principles of science and a spiritual outlook. The questions raised are issues that will be discussed by an emerging network of scientists and spiritual seekers, and this book will add a valued and informed perspective to these conversations.

It therefore deals especially with the return of religious themes and symbols into politics, with the analysis of the link between political theory and religion, and finally with the critical discussion of the secularization thesis. At the centre of the research are questions concerning the causes of violent conflict, the possibilities for a just world order and the conditions for peaceful coexistence on a local, regional, national and international/worldwide scale between communities in the face of divergent religious and ideological convictions. Its task is to initiate and coordinate thematically related research-efforts from various disciplinary backgrounds at the University of Innsbruck. It creates a network between departments, research-teams and single researchers working on topics of religion, politics and violence. The overall aim of the research platform World Order-Religion-Violence is to promote excellence in social and human science research on religion and politics at the University of Innsbruck and to guarantee the diffusion of this particular competence on a national and international level.""

Geografie di oggi. Metodi e strategie tra ricerca e didattica,Giovanni Donadelli,religion,First published in 2015,/works/OL20932435W,/authors/OL8012184A/Giovanni_Donadelli,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  FrancoAngeli|Pages 282,"The volume offers new keys of interpretation and methodologies useful to understand the changes and the challenges of the contemporary world. The proposed geographical path is structured in four sections. A particular focus is on educational reality and the role of geography as a discipline able to train and educate a conscious and active citizenship.  Questo volume è l’esito del confronto e delle riflessioni sviluppate durante il II Workshop “AIIG Giovani” organizzato a Roma nell’aprile del 2013. Nasce da un desiderio, quello di presentare l’importanza della combinazione tra metodi d’indagine tradizionali e nuovi per costruire sapere geografico, e da una passione, sostenuta dall’intreccio di relazioni umane che si evolvono nel tempo. Per chiarire quale possa essere il contributo della geografia alla comprensione del mondo contemporaneo, sempre più complesso, gli autori presentano le principali metodologie geografiche in quattro sezioni: “Territori della tecnologia”, “Identità, spazi, luoghi”, “Nodi della rete” e “Approcci sperimentali nella scuola che cambia”. Emerge dal lavoro un quadro multifocale che rispecchia la poliedricità e la trasversalità della geografia contemporanea, ancorato al comune bisogno di sviluppare strumenti interpretativi e d’azione. Ci si muove nell’ambito di una geografia critica e della complessità in grado di fornire ai cittadini globali differenti strumenti di interpretazione e comprensione del mondo, nuove metafore a partire dalle quali costruire e sperimentare forme alternative di cittadinanza consapevole ed attiva. Qui la geografia ritrova lo slancio di una disciplina fertile capace non solo di descrivere la Terra, ma anche di immaginare e creare nuovi mondi possibili. L’approdo naturale di questo percorso è la realtà scolastica dove è possibile sperimentare nuove forme di sapere e azione per rispondere alla sfida educativa contemporanea.

Still reeling from these losses, she was raped by a friend she thought she could trust. She soon spiraled into a seemingly bottomless depression.One January night, the seventeen-year-old decided she no longer wanted to deal with the emotional pain that smothered her. She lay down on a set of cold railroad tracks and waited for a freight train to send her to heaven...and peace.But Kristen's story doesn't end there. In Life, In Spite of Me this remarkably joyful young woman shares the miracle of her survival, the agonizing aftermath of her failed suicide attempt, and the hope that has completely transformed her life, giving her a powerful purpose for living.Her gripping story of finding joy against all odds provides a vivid and unforgettable reminder that life is a gift to be treasured.

In spite of its effectiveness — or, indeed, because of it — science has cut the individual adrift from his moorings, depriving him not only of a sense of ultimate meaning and purpose but also from the possibility of ever finding them. For science denies the conviction that value and meaning can be found in the facts of the world and, worse still, defines all truths as provisional, as hypotheses yet to be verified or refuted. [...]  If science were merely a methodology, this would not be a serious problem. But today science has become the dominant way of understanding the world and our place in it. It shapes our political lives, our economics, our health, and [...] even our understanding of ourselves. [...]  Appleyard devotes a chapter each to the emergence of environmentalism as a new kind of religion and to the metaphysical speculations accompanying advances in relativity, quantum mechanics, and chaos theory — the three major scientific achievements of the twentieth century. In both cases, he is sympathetic but ultimately skeptical that these developments can relieve the existential crisis brought on by the rise of the scientific worldview. He is especially wary of scientists like Stephen Hawking and Carl Sagan who believe in the possibility of a grand, unifying ""Theory of Everything,"" or those champions of artificial intelligence who are working on the construction of ""conscious"" machines.  As Appleyard sees it, [...] science must be recognized for what it is: ""a form of mysticism that proves peculiarly fertile in setting itself problems which only it can solve.""

In Come to the Quiet, John Michael Talbot explores these roots and offers daily practices and exercises to help readers bring this tradition into their everyday lives.While millions of Americans have discovered the ancient wisdom of Eastern meditation practices, the valuable tradition of meditation within Christianity has been greatly overlooked. Now, with this book, Christians eager to look to their own faith in order to discover the spiritual, psychological, and physical health benefits of meditation will have a valuable resource to which they can turn. An influential thinker within the Catholic Church who has touched millions with his hauntingly beautiful, meditative music, Talbot brings a wealth of knowledge and insight to this important subject.

Over the years, his beliefs about God were challenged by painful and confusing experiences in church as a teenager, the death of a beloved friend in college, and bouts of doubt and despair in graduate school.  He married the girl of his dreams, yet he was still not happy. Then came the quadruplets. And the author thought God had gone nuts. He was terrified of the disruption that one child would bring to his life, let alone four. God, however, knew exactly what he was doing.  Assaulted by Joy follows the growth and spiritual renewal of a self-proclaimed 'jerk' who discovers the inescapable tension between joy and suffering. Each chapter recounts events---from the suspenseful to the heartbreaking to the hysterical---that teach lessons about God, life, love, marriage, and the assaulting joy of being a new father.

Within a few months, their lives were thrown into chaos as they became pawns in historic international events. They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked. In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target. While many feared Curry and Mercer could not survive in the midst of war, Americans nonetheless prayed for their safe return, and in November their prayers were answered.  In Prisoners of Hope, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer tell the story of their work in Afghanistan, their love for the people they served, their arrest, trial, and imprisonment by the Taliban, and their rescue by U.S. Special Forces. The heart of the book will discuss how two middle-class American women decided to leave the comforts of home in exchange for the opportunity to serve the disadvantaged, and how their faith motivated them and sustained them through the events that followed. Their story is a magnificent narrative of ordinary women caught in extraordinary circumstances as a result of their commitment to serve the poorest and most oppressed women and children in the world. This book will be inspiring to those who seek a purpose greater than themselves.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

After you believe: why Christian character matters,N. T.

As Christians, what are we to do with that ambiguous time between baptism and the funeral? It's easy to become preoccupied with who gets into heaven; the real challenge is how we are going to live in the here and now.Wright dispels the common misconception that Christian living is nothing more than a checklist of dos and don'ts. Nor is it a prescription to ""follow your heart"" wherever it may lead. Instead, After You Believe reveals the Bible's call for a revolution—a transformation of character that takes us beyond our earthly pursuit of money, sex, and power into a virtuous state of living that allows us to reflect God and live more worshipful, fulfilling lives.We are all spiritual seekers, intuitively knowing there is more to life than we suspect. This is a book for anyone who is hoping there is something more while we're here on Earth. There is. We are being called to join the revolution, and Wright insightfully encourages readers to find new purpose and clarity by taking us on an eye-opening journey through key biblical passages that promise to radically alter the work of the church and the direction of our lives.

Bush's assurances that Islam is a peaceful religion and that all good Muslims hunger for democracy, confusion persists and far too many Westerners remain convinced that Muslims and terrorists are synonymous. In the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11, the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the recent bombings in London, an unprecedented amount of attention has been directed toward Islam and the Muslim world. Yet, even with this increased scrutiny, most of the public discourse regarding Islam revolves around the actions of extremist factions such as the Wahhabis and al-Qa'ida. But what of the Islam we don't hear about?As the second-largest and fastest-growing religion in the world, Islam is deemed by more than a billion Muslims to be a source of serenity and spiritual peace, and a touchstone for moral and ethical guidance. While extremists have an impact upon the religion that is wildly disproportionate to their numbers, moderates constitute the majority of Muslims worldwide. It is this rift between the quiet voice of the moderates and the deafening statements of the extremists that threatens the future of the faith.In The Great Theft, Khaled Abou El Fadl, one of the world's preeminent Islamic scholars, argues that Islam is currently passing through a transformative period no less dramatic than the movements that swept through Europe during the Reformation. At this critical juncture there are two completely opposed worldviews within Islam competing to define this great world religion. The stakes have never been higher, and the future of the Muslim world hangs in the balance.Drawing on the rich tradition of Islamic history and law, The Great Theft is an impassioned defense of Islam against the encroaching power of the extremists. As an accomplished Islamic jurist, Abou El Fadl roots his arguments in long-standing historical legal debates and delineates point by point the beliefs and practices of moderate Muslims, distinguishing these tenets from the corrupting influences of the extremists. From the role of women in Islam to the nature of jihad, from democracy and human rights to terrorism and warfare, Abou El Fadl builds a vital vision for a moderate Islam. At long last, the great majority of Muslims who oppose extremism have a desperately needed voice to help reclaim Islam's great moral tradition.

The young people awaiting the Pope's address in Galway were entertained by two of Ireland's most charismatic clerics, Bishop Eamon Casey and Fr Michael Cleary, both of whom were subsequently revealed to have been engaged in romantic liaisons at the time. The decades that followed the Pope's visit were characterised by the increasing secularisation of Irish society. Boasting an impressive array of contributors from various backgrounds and expertise, the essays in the book attempt to trace the exact reasons for the progressive dismantling of the cultural legacy of Catholicism and the consequences this has had on Irish society.

It is impossible to give full details in one short volume: but Dr Bouquet, who has specialized in the subject for over twenty years, here introduces readers to it, giving due attention to all parts of the world, and especially to India and the Far East.    He writes with scientific impartiality, and with full recognition of recent developments in the acquisition of knowledge: and he believes that there is only one right way of persuading, and that is to present what is true in such a way that nothing will prevent it from being seen except the desire to remain in darkness.

Handbook on religion in China,Stephan Feuchtwang,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL32323046W,/authors/OL764190A/Stephan_Feuchtwang,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Edward Elgar Publishing|Language English|Pages 488,"""Informative and eye-opening, the Handbook on Religion in China provides a uniquely broad insight into the contemporary Chinese variations of Buddhism, Islam and Christianity. In turn, China's own religions of Daoism, of filial piety and transmissions of rites have spread beyond China, a progression that is explored in detail across 19 chapters, written by leading experts in the field. Utilising a historical focus to emphasize developments and highlight the transformations of ritual practices, festivals, divination and traditions, this Handbook deals with the emergence of new attitudes to selfhood and the great diversity of civic and other rituals. Traditional ways of forming relationships and conducting life-cycle rituals are also considered. This comprehensive Handbook investigates the ways in which all of these changes are affected by governmental controls that have intriguing unintended consequences. Providing a solid introduction for both newcomers and informed readers, this Handbook will be a key resource for sociologists and anthropologists of ritual and religion as well as students of religious studies, contemporary Chinese studies and the sociology of religion. With extensive references to assist readers wishing to further deepen their understanding this Handbook will also be of interest to historians and individuals interested in contemporary China""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide,Sarah Iles Johnston,religion,First published in 2004,/works/OL1978524W,/authors/OL237923A/Sarah_Iles_Johnston,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7671169M-M.jpg,"Publish Date November 30, 2004|Publisher  Belknap Press|Language English|Pages 736","Religious beliefs and practices, which permeated all aspects of life in antiquity, traveled well-worn routes throughout the Mediterranean: itinerant charismatic practitioners journeying from place to place peddled their skills as healers, purifiers, cursers, and initiators; and vessels decorated with illustrations of myths traveled with them. New gods encountered in foreign lands by merchants and conquerors were sometimes taken home to be adapted and adopted. A full understanding of this complex spiritual world unfolds in Religions of the Ancient World, the first basic reference work that collects and organizes available information to offer an expansive, comparative perspective.  At once sweeping in scope and groundbreaking in format, the Guide eschews the usual encyclopedic approach, instead presenting, side by side, materials from ten cultures and traditions. Thus specific beliefs, cults, gods, and ritual practices that arose and developed in Mediterranean religions--of Egypt, Anatolia and the Near East, Mesopotamia, Iran, Greece, and the Roman world, from the third millennium to the fourth century C.E.--are interpreted in comparison with one another, and with reference to aspects that crisscross cultural boundaries, such as Cosmology, Myth, Law and Ethics, and Magic. Written by leading scholars of ancient religion, the essays in this guide sketch the various religious histories, raise central theoretical issues, and examine individual topics such as Sacred Times and Spaces; Prayers, Hymns, Incantations, and Curses; Sin, Pollution, and Purity; Death, the Afterlife, and Other Last Things; Divination and Prophecy; Deities and Demons; and Sacred Texts and Canonicity.  Clearly and stylishly written, grandly illustrated, this comprehensive work welcomes readers as never before into the diversity and interconnections of religion in the ancient world.

For so many people, religion continues to represent a crucial guide to navigating through the strange world we all inhabit -- yet never in history has religion been more misunderstood. The Importance of Religion illuminates the central importance of religion in modern times, revealing how it crucially provides people with meaning to their lives and guides them in their everyday moral choices. Renowned religion scholar Gavin Flood argues that modern religions do not just represent passive notions about the nature of reality, but are active and inspirational -- they show us ways of living, dying, choosing a good life, and inhabiting the strange and mysterious world of the twenty-first century. In a wide-ranging, engaging and brilliant book, Gavin Flood discusses the nature and meaning of religion and spirituality; and religion's relationship with politics, science, evolutionary biology, human rights, culture, humanism, and more. The Importance of Religion offers rich insights into the myriad ways religion provides meaning to the lives of people and communities in the modern world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Providing much of the basis of our knowledge of their sacred world view in which 'we are all related', they sound a profoundly spiritual note which speaks directly to the ecological crisis and the de-humanization of man so often discussed in our time. On a deeper level, Ohiyesa's message speaks to every person who seeks a spiritual way in the midst of a society increasingly dominated by materialism and industrial technology. It was around the turn of the Twentieth Century that he wrote, ""It is my personal belief, after thirty-five years' experience of it, that there is no such thing as 'Christian civilization.' I believe that Christianity and modern civilization are opposed and irreconcilable, and that the spirit of Christianity and of our ancient religion is essentially the same.""Ohiyesa's prophetic voice speaks now across three centuries with an urgency which is still fresh and original. Not only should students of Native American philosophy carefully read this book, it should be essential reading for all people who search the ancient worlds for light to better understand the problems which press upon us today. Editor Michael Fitzgerald has written and edited many publications on American Indian spirituality, including Yellowtail: Crow Medicine Man and Sun Dance Chief, which he recorded and edited and which was first published in 1991 by the University of Oklahoma Press (now in its fifth printing).  Prior to his death in 1993, Yellowtail made many visits to Fitzgerald's home in Bloomington, Indiana. And, for over 30 years Fitzgerald has spent extensive amounts of time each summer visiting various American Indian tribes throughout the Plains and the Southwest and has attended sacred rites of the Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone and Apache tribes.He is also the editor of the best selling, Indian Spirit (World Wisdom, 2003).In addition, Fitzgerald has taught Religious Traditions of the North American Indians in the Indiana University Continuing Studies Department at Bloomington, Indiana. He holds a BA, magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, and a JD, cum laude, from Indiana University.Mr. Fitzgerald has been an adopted member of the Thomas Yellowtail family and the Crow tribe since 1972.

This collection will bring together many of Burckhardt's most representative writings that will amply demonstrate these qualities.The editor of the collection, Dr. William Stoddart, is himself a writer within the Perennialist school, and is perhaps best known for his concise outlines of many the world's great religious traditions as well as for his many excellent translations into English of many of the works of Schuon and Burckhardt.This essential collection of Burckhardt's writings is illustrated by numerous black and white drawings, and sixteen pages of full color photograhs   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Its separation from religion was, however, never complete and we see the contest continued today not only in the campaigns of religious fundamentalists of the right, but also in the clains of critical intellectuals to reshape government institutions and the legal apparatus in accordance with moral principle - whether of indivudual autonomy or communitarian self-determination. In Anti-Lawyers, David Saunders traces the story of this unresolved conflict from Hobbes' Leviathan to the American law texts of today, and discusses how we might regard today's moral critics of government and law in the light of the early modern effort to disengage spiritual discipline from secular government and conscience from law. Separate sections look at major figures in English common law in the Early Modern period, French and German absolutism and jurisprudence as it is taught in the American law texts of today.

He found an oppressed minority under threat of death and humiliation and increasingly desperate in the face of rising Islamic extremism. Wivel spoke with priests whose churches have been burned, citizens who feel like strangers in their own countries, and entire communities whose only hope for survival may be fleeing into exile. This is an unsettling account of a severely beleaguered religious group living, so it seems, on borrowed time. Wivel asks, why have we not done more to protect these people?""--Page [4] of cover.

These places are also rallying points for immigrants, helping them make the transition to a new, and often hostile environment. The Many Rooms of this House is a story about the rise and decline of religion in Toronto over the past 160 years. Unlike other studies that concentrate on specific denominations, or ecclesiastical politics, Roberto Perin's ecumenical approach focuses on the physical places of worship and the local clergy and congregants that gather there. Perin's timely and nuanced analysis reveals how the growing wealth of the city stimulated congregations to compete with one another over the size, style, materials, and decoration of their places of worship. However, the rise of individualism has negatively affected these same congregations leading to multiple church closings, communal breakdown, and redevelopments. Perin's fascinating work is a lens to understanding how this once overwhelmingly Protestant city became a symbol of diversity.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It adapted itself with perfect comprehension to the ideals of the Japanese people, inculcating among them the teachings of morality common to the great faiths with, in addition, the spiritual unction, the passion of love and sympathy, self-devotion, and compassion, in which Buddhism and Christianity are alike pre-eminent. The negative side of Buddhism, with its passionless calm and self-renunciation, is the only one that has been realised in the West, and the teachings of Mahayana which have borne fruit and flower, visible to all the world, of happiness, courtesy, kindliness in the spiritual attitude of a whole people, have never received the honour which was their due.For with the Buddhist faith there came the germ of the belief that the Gautama Buddha in his own grandeur bore witness to One Greater - the Amitabha or Amida Buddha - that One who in boundless light abideth, life of the Universe, without colour, without form, the Lover of man, his Protector and Refuge. He may, He must be worshipped, for in Him are all the essential attributes of Deity, and He, the Saviour of mankind, has prepared a pure land of peace for his servants, beyond the storms of life and death. This belief eventually crystallised and became a dogma in the faith of the Pure Land, known in Japan as Jodo Shinshu, a faith held by the majority of the Japanese people. It is a Belief which has spread also in Eastern Siberia, many parts of China, Hawaii, and, in fact, whereever the Japanese race has spread. And the man who stated this belief for all time was Shinran Shonin, author of the Psalms here presented.He was born in the year A.D. 1175 near City-Royal - Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. He was a son of one of the noblest families, in close connection with the Imperial House, and had it not been for the passion for truth and the life of the spirit which consumed him, his history would have been that of the many other brilliant young men who sank into mere courtiers - ""Dwellers above the Clouds,"" as the royalties and courtiers of the day were called among the people. But the clear air above the clouds in which his spirit spread its wings was not that of City-Royal, and the Way opened before him as it has opened before many a saint of the Christian Church, for while still a child he lost both his parents, and so, meditating on the impermanence of mortal life, and seeing how the fashion of this world passes away, he abandoned his title and became a monk in one of the noble monasteries whose successors still stand glorious among the pine woods above Lake Biwa.These were not only monasteries, but seats of learning, as in Europe in the Middle Ages, and here the Doctrines were subjected to brilliant analysis and logical subtleties which had almost superseded the living faith. In that cold atmosphere the spirit of Shiran Shonin could not spread its wings, though for twenty years he gave his thoughts to its empty glitter. Therefore, at the age of twenty-nine he cast it all behind him, and in deep humility cast himself at the feet of the great Teacher Honen, who, in the shades of Higashiyama, was setting forth the saving power of the Eternal One who abideth in the Light and in whom is no darkness - the Buddha of Boundless Light. And in this place and from this man Shinran received enlightenment.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Rintoul had accused the preacher of fortune hunting, but what was he after — especially if he were indeed Cromwell's witchfinder?   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The treasury of American prayers,James P.

Some are simple, straightforward entreaties; others are elaborate invocations. All of them, however, provide indelible imprints and keys to understanding the inner sanctum of the individuals who made America what it is today.The prayers of these Americans are intimate snapshots of how they dealt with the gamut of human emotions, conditions, and events they experienced. They found comfort, hope, and the ability simply to endure by turning to God in their often unpredictable lives.While the language of these prayers may vary from era to era, the essence remains the same. Americans from all walks of life and faiths have found their existences incomplete without being able to reach out to a higher power. It is through the words of their prayers that they find purpose in a larger context and from a greater perspective.--James P. Moore Jr.Since its inception, America has remained a deeply religious and spiritual nation, fostering a prayer culture that has thrived among its diverse population and its wide-ranging faith traditions.The Treasury of American Prayers brings together hundreds of prayers composed largely by Americans from all walks of life to create an unparalleled and comprehensive collection of ""home-grown"" expressions of spirituality and religious conviction. These prayers form an inspiring portrait of the country's rich and profound faith and provide access to the innermost thoughts of such individuals as Benjamin Franklin, Elvis Presley, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Conrad Hilton. They have helped sustain Americans in times of war and recession as well as in periods of change and even prosperity. Jim Moore has compiled an extraordinary anthology in The Treasury of American Prayers, arranged by such topics as patience, thanksgiving, despair, love, and other timeless themes. He provides context, historical perspective, and a personal insight for each prayer. While this collection reflects the great history of the American experience, these prayers also hold great resonance for Americans today.

It meanders through the darkness to encounter the monsters at the heart of the maze: Minotaurs, Centaurs, Automata, Makers, Humans. One part of our human thought emerges from classical Ionia and Greek civilisation more generally. We obsessively return to that thought, tread again its pathways, re-enact its stories, repeat its motifs and gestures. We return time and time again to construct and re-construct the beings which were part of its cosmology and mythology – stories enacted from a classical world which is itself at once imaginary and material.  The “Never Never Lands” of the ancient world contain fabulous beasts and humans and landscapes of desire and violence. We encounter the rioting Centaurs there and never again cease to conjure them up time and time again through our history. The Centaur mythologies display a fascination with animals and what binds and divides human beings from them. The Centaur hints ultimately at the idea of the genesis of civilisation itself.  The Labyrinth, constructed by Daedalus, is itself a prison and a way of thinking about making, designing, and human aspiration. Designed by humans it offers mysteries that would be repeated time and time again – a motif which is replicated through human history. Daedalus himself is an archetype for creation and mastery, the designer of artefacts and machines which would be the beginning of forays into the total domination of nature.  Centaurs, Labyrinths, Automata offer clues to the origins and ultimately the futures of humanity and what might come after it.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It presents the full arsenal of ideas with which Marx and Engels hoped to explode the religious foundations of all previous societies. Yet also in these writings, as Reinhold Neibuhr's Introduction reveals, are clues to that remarkable development whereby an irreligion was transmuted into a new political religion, canonized precisely in the writings of Marx as sacred scripture. Included are excerpts from Das Kapital, occasional journalistic pieces, private letters, and more formal philosophical writings.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is not that people willfully forsake a demanding sexual ethic for a more easygoing worldly one. It is that they often cannot see the point of its ‘demandingness.’” Thus begins author Adrian Thatcher’s project of laying out an unashamedly and wholeheartedly liberal approach to sex and sexuality. Fully aware that for some the word liberal has taken on negative connotations, Thatcher builds on a liberalism in which individuals are encouraged to make up their minds about what faith is and how they are to apply it to their own lives, recognizing that within the boundaries of faith there is much scope for variety in individual belief and practice. Using familiar theological ideas, biblical passages, and Christian doctrines, Thatcher sets out to place them intelligibly in a twenty-first-century context. Subjects covered include desire, bodies, sexual difference, marriage, spirituality, and sexualities. (Publisher).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Throughout history, this subject has been discussed, defended, refuted, and debated. With the New Atheists gaining a loud voice in today's world, it is time to revisit the longstanding intellectual tradition on the side of faith. Francis Collins, New York Times bestselling author of The Language of God and renowned physician and geneticist, defends the reason for faith in this provocative collection. Collins is our guide as he takes us through the writings of many of the world's greatest thinkers,- philosophers, preachers, poets, scientists - both past and present, including such luminaries as C. S. Lewis and Augustine, and unexpected voices such as A.N. Wilson and Annie Dillard. Despite the doubts of a cynical world, this essential companion proves once and for all the rationality of faith. Including C. S. Lewis * Madeleine L'Engle * Martin Luther King * Annie Dillard * Elie Wiesel Desmond Tutu * Mother Teresa * Blaise Pascal * Mahatma Gandhi * And many more""--Provided by publisher.

Monotheism (from a sociopolitical and economic perspective),Murat Iyigun,religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL24105801W,/authors/OL1452763A/Murat_Iyigun,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  IZA|Language English,"""The Axial Age, which lasted between 800 B. C. E. and 200 B. C. E., covers an era in which the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in various geographic areas, and all three major monotheisms of Judaism, Christianity and Islam were born between 1200 B. C. E. and 622 C. E. in the Middle East. In this paper, I offer a taxonomy to comprehensively characterize the impact of monotheism on early economic development. Monotheist religions produced a paradigm shift in sociopolitical institutions because they (a) involve a strong degree of increasing returns to scale and the natural monopoly powers commensurate with it, (b) not only personalize the spiritual exchange relationship between the individual and the one deity, but also, due to the fact that this relationship extends into the afterlife as well, enhance individual accountability, and (c) expand their adherents' time horizon beyond biological life and impact the time discount between one's lifetime and the after-life. Taken together, these features suggest that the spread of monotheism ought to have promoted sociopolitical stability. Utilizing original historical data between 2500 B. C. E. and 1750 C. E. on 105 limited access orders, such as dynasties, kingdoms and empires, I show that monotheism had a positive and statistically significant impact on the length of reign as well as the average geographical size of social orders. Thus, I find empirical evidence that the birth and adoption of monotheistic religions aided early development both in the West and the Near East until the advent of the Industrial Revolution""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

The next thing she realized was that her house had been struck by a bolt of lightning and was engulfed in flames.  Macy saw no way out of her bedroom and cried out for her parents.  Just moments before the spreading fire would have swallowed her up, an unseen force gently took her by the hand and guided her through the fire and outside to safety.  She turned to thank this stranger, only to find no one in sight.  ""It must have been my guardian angel,"" Macy later concluded.Have you ever wondered if you would be able to spot your guardian angel?  Angels in Our Midst invites you to ponder the real-life stories of ordinary men and women whose lives have been completely altered by the remarkable work of angels.  The stories collected here will help all of us understand the true nature of angels, and realize that their presence provides not just succor, but the reassuring evidence of a loving God who is forever watching over us.  Here is your invitation to enter a new level of wonder in your life, explore the ageless mysteries of divine intervention, and discover how you might recognize your own guardian angel in times of need.

It is time for us to have a serious conversation about poverty. A modern approach must work to solve the current problem. Local- and state-level initiatives have the power to achieve a strategic approach to the Beloved Community. To truly accomplish a Beloved Community, the United States must abolish poverty.  And The Beat Goes On is a way forward that builds on the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  It is a prescription for where we go from here. Pushing for a public policy that urges America to do what is moral and right for the common good of all people, to building communities with a liberative praxis that ensures sustainability, Kevin Brown sounds the clarion call for a constitutional amendment that guarantees an end to poverty. This book is for leaders at every level who are ready to work collectively so that all people thrive and flourish.  And The Beat Goes On is a rallying cry for a more just and compassionate society.

We often think of doubt as the opposite of faith, but could it actually strengthen our relationship with God?  According to John Ortberg, best-selling author and pastor, the very nature of faith requires the presence of uncertainty.  In this refreshingly candid look at a life of faith, he traces the line between belief and unbelief: less  a dividing line between  hostile camps than a razor's edge that runs through every soul.  His findings point us toward the relief of being totally honest.  Questions can expand our understanding, uncertainty can lead to trust, and honest faith can produce outrageous hope.  Written from Ortberg's own struggle with faith and doubt, this book will challenge, comfort, and inspire you with the truth that God wants all of us---including our doubts.

"Derrida, myth, and the impossibility of philosophy",Anais Spitzer,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL16977175W?edition=ia%3Aderridamythimpos00spit,/authors/OL7211169A/Anais_Spitzer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25562393M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Continuum|Language English|Pages 198,"In Derrida, Myth and the Impossibility of Philosophy, Anais N. Spitzer shows that philosophy cannot separate itself from myth since myth is an inevitable condition of the possibility of philosophy. Bombarded by narratives that terrorize and repress, we may often consider myth to be constrictive dogma or, at best, something to be readily disregarded as unphilosophical and irrelevant. However, such dismissals miss a crucial aspect of myth. Harnessing the insights of Jacques Derridaʹs deconstruction and Mark C. Taylorʹs philosophical reading of complexity theory, Derrida, Myth and the Impossibility of Philosophy provocatively reframes the pivotal relation of myth to thinking and to philosophy, demonstrating that myth's inherent ambiguity engenders vital and inescapable deconstructive propensities. Exploring myth's disruptive presence, Spitzer shows that philosophy cannot separate itself from myth. Instead, myth is an inevitable condition of the possibility of philosophy. This study provides a nuanced account of myth in the postmodern era, not only laying out the deconstructive underpinnings of myth in philosophy and religion, but establishing the very necessity of myth in the study of ideas. -- Publisher description from http://www.continuumbooks.com (Oct. 10, 2011).

In his massive and highly publicized The Death of the Messiah, Raymond Brown -- while clearly rejecting anti-Semitism -- never questions the essential historicity of the passion stories. Yet it is these stories, in which the Jews decide Jesus' execution, that have fueled centuries of Christian anti-Semitism.Now, in his most controversial book, John Dominic Crossan shows that this traditional understanding of the Gospels as historical fact is not only wrong but dangerous. Drawing on the best of biblical, anthropological, sociological and historical research, he demonstrates definitively that it was the Roman government that tried and executed Jesus as a social agitator. Crossan also candidly addresses such key theological questions as ""Did Jesus die for our sins?"" and ""Is our faith in vain if there was no bodily resurrection?""Ultimately, however, Crossan's radical reexamination shows that the belief that the Jews killed Jesus is an early Christian myth (directed against rival Jewish groups) that must be eradicated from authentic Christian faith.

Writer, philosopher, and professor of comparative religion, Daniele Bolelli, leads the reader through three thousand years of mythology, misogyny, misinformation, and the flat-out lies about ""revealed truth"" that continue to muddle our ability to live a peaceful life, free of guilt and shame and the ultimate fear of death."" Our worldviews are in desperate need of some housecleaning,"" says Bolelli. ""We enter the 21st century still carrying on our backs the prejudices and ways of thinking of countless past generations. What worked for them may or may not still be of use, so it is our job to make sure to save the tools that can help us and let go of the dead weight.

This book is neither a history or a critique. Instead it explains, simply and sympathetically, the basic tenants of each religion and the reasons why it attracts millions of devout followers. As the author explains in the first chapter, “This is a book about religion that exists . . . . not as a dull habit but as an acute fever. It is about religion alive. And whenever religion comes to life it displays a startling quality; it takes over. All else, while not silenced, becomes subdued and thrown without contest into a supporting role. The Religions of Man is a thoroughly researched, informative, fascinating presentation of both the differences and the similarities in the major religious traditions.

Sin embargo, la cantidad de información de la que disponemos hoy en día puede provocar un efecto de saturación y confusión. ¿Cómo abrirse paso entre las innumerables Iglesias, confesiones o minorías cristianas, musulmanas o budistas? A menudo, los creyentes también se pierden. ¿Es Putin ortodoxo y Barack Obama protestante? ¿Era Gandhi budista o hinduista? El desconocimiento lleva a la incomprensión, que fácilmente se convierte en descon anza e intolerancia. El propósito de esta obra es levantar un poco dicho velo. En ella encontrarás las principales religiones: el milenario judaísmo, el cristianismo y sus Iglesias, el islam sunita y chiita, y espiritualidades orientales como el budismo y el hinduismo.

Focusing on the decision by many women to embrace locally specific forms of Pentecostal Christianity, Nathaniel Roberts challenges dominant anthropological understandings of religion as a matter of culture and identity, as well as Indian nationalist narratives of Christianity as a “foreign” ideology that disrupts local communities. Far from being a divisive force, conversion integrates the slum community—Christians and Hindus alike—by addressing hidden moral fault lines that subtly pit residents against one another in a national context that renders Dalits outsiders in their own land.""

Taylor argues in After God, is more complicated than either its defenders or critics think and, indeed, is much more influential than any of us realize. Our world, Taylor maintains, is shaped by religion even when it is least obvious. Faith and value, he insists, are unavoidable and inextricably interrelated for believers and nonbelievers alike.The first comprehensive theology of culture since the pioneering work of Paul Tillich, After God redefines religion for our contemporary age. This volume is a radical reconceptualization of religion and Taylor’s most pathbreaking work yet, bringing together various strands of theological argument and cultural analysis four decades in the making.Praise for Mark C. Taylor""The distinguishing feature of Taylor’s career is a fearless, or perhaps reckless, orientation to the new and to whatever challenges orthodoxy....Taylor’s work is playful, perverse, rarefied, ingenious, and often brilliant.""—New York Times Magazine   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For those of us who feel like this, religion has been losing its credibility and relevance. But our departure from religion is simultaneously a departure from its rich treasures of spiritual practice, community, organized action, and hard lessons learned, often leaving us isolated, incoherent, and ill-equipped for our spiritual journeys. It's Really All About God is a very personal story and a thrilling exploration of a redeeming, dynamic, and radically different way to hold one's religion.

Daily life of the Egyptian gods,Dimitri Meeks,religion,First published in 1996,/works/OL3096884W?edition=ia%3Adailylifeofegypt0000meek,/authors/OL485089A/Dimitri_Meeks,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL971214M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Cornell University Press|Language English|Pages 288,"This is the first English translation of a highly appealing volume originally published in French in 1993. Informed by a sense of wonderment at divine doings, it treats the ancient Egyptian gods as if they were an ethnic group that captured the fancy of ethnologists or sociologists.  The book begins with a discussion of the gods' community as a society unto itself. The authors describe the structures of the society of the gods and some of the conflics that frequently upset it, with individual gods acting to protect their own positions in an established hierarchy and struggling to gain power over their fellows. The nature of their immortal but not invulnerable bodies, their pleasures, and their needs are considered. What did they eat, the authors ask, and did they feel pain?  The second part of the book cites familiar traditions and little-known texts to explain the relationship of the gods to the pharaoh, who was believed to represent them on earth. By performing appropriate rites, the pharaoh maintained a delicate equlibrium, balancing the sky home of the sun god, the underworld of Osiris and the dead, and the earth itself. While each world was autonomous and had its own mythological context, the separate spheres were also interdependent, requiring the sun's daily course and the pharaoh's ritual actions to ensure the cohesion of the universe.

"Christians, Muslims, and Jesus",Mona Siddiqui,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL19668305W?edition=ia%3Achristiansmuslim0000sidd,/authors/OL3383024A/Mona_Siddiqui,//archive.org/services/img/christiansmuslim0000sidd,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Yale University Press|Language English|Pages 285,"""Prophet or messiah, the figure of Jesus serves as both the bridge and the barrier between Christianity and Islam. In this accessible and thoughtful book, Muslim scholar and popular commentator Mona Siddiqui takes her reader on a personal, theological journey exploring the centrality of Jesus in Christian-Muslim relations. Christian and Muslim scholars have used Jesus and Christological themes for polemical and dialogical conversations from the earliest days to modern times. The author concludes with her own reflections on the cross and its possible meaning in her Muslim faith. Through a careful analysis of selected works by major Christian and Muslim theologians during the formative, medieval and modern periods of both religions, Siddiqui focuses on themes including revelation, prophecy, salvation, redemption, sin, eschatology, law and love. How did some doctrines become the defining characteristics of one faith and not the other? What is the nature of the theological chasm between Christianity and Islam? With a nuanced and carefully considered analysis of critical doctrines the author provides a refreshingly honest counterpoint to contemporary polemical arguments and makes a compelling contribution to reasoned interfaith conversation.""--Jacket.

It is manifest in the revival of religious institutions and traditions in former communist countries, in political controversies about the relationship between the church(es) and the state and about the freedom of religion and the freedom to criticize religion, and in public unease about religious minorities. This book is about religion and civil society in Europe.

Heaven's gate,Benjamin E.

To outsiders, it was a mass suicide. To insiders, it was a graduation. This act was the culmination of over two decades of spiritual and social development for the members of Heaven's Gate, a religious group focused on transcending humanity and the Earth, and seeking salvation in the literal heavens on board a UFO.  In this fascinating overview, Benjamin Zeller not only explores the question of why the members of Heaven's Gate committed ritual suicides, but interrogates the origin and evolution of the religion, its appeal, and its practices. By tracking the development of the history, social structure, and worldview of Heaven's Gate, Zeller draws out the ways in which the movement was both a reflection and a microcosm of larger American culture.The group emerged out of engagement with Evangelical Christianity, the New Age movement, science fiction and UFOs, and conspiracy theories, and it evolved in response to the religious quests of baby boomers, new religions of the counterculture, and the narcissistic pessimism of the 1990s. Thus, Heaven's Gate not only reflects the context of its environment, but also reveals how those forces interacted in the form of a single religious body.  In the only book-length study of Heaven's Gate, Zeller traces the roots of the movement, examines its beliefs and practices, and tells the captivating story of the people of Heaven's Gate.

Terry Eagleton, formidable thinker and renowned cultural critic, investigates in this thought-provoking book the contradictions, difficulties, and significance of the modern search for a replacement for God. Engaging with a phenomenally wide range of ideas, issues, and thinkers from the Enlightenment to today, Eagleton discusses the state of religion before and after 9/11, the ironies surrounding Western capitalism’s part in spawning not only secularism but also fundamentalism, and the unsatisfactory surrogates for the Almighty invented in the post-Enlightenment era.  The author reflects on the unique capacities of religion, the possibilities of culture and art as modern paths to salvation, the so-called war on terror’s impact on atheism, and a host of other topics of concern to those who envision a future in which just and compassionate communities thrive. Lucid, stylish, and entertaining in his usual manner, Eagleton presents a brilliant survey of modern thought that also serves as a timely, urgently needed intervention into our perilous political present.

By going into the neighborhoods of real cities, Enos shows how our perceptions of racial, ethnic, and religious groups are intuitively shaped by where these groups live and interact daily. Through the lens of numerous examples across the globe and drawing on a compelling combination of research techniques including field and laboratory experiments, big data analysis, and small-scale interactions, this timely book provides a new understanding of how geography shapes politics and how members of groups think about each other. Enos' analysis is punctuated with personal accounts from the field. His rigorous research unfolds in accessible writing that will appeal to specialists and non-specialists alike, illuminating the profound effects of social geography on how we relate to, think about, and politically interact across groups in the fabric of our daily lives""--Jacket.

What is to be gained for the whole Church when this happens in a deep and lasting way? In this timely and important study, Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor brings greater theological clarity to the issue of the relationship between Christianity and African tradition in the area of ethical foundations. He also provides a constructive example of what fundamental moral theology done from an African and Christian (especially Catholic) moral theological point of view could look like. Following a brief history of the development of African Christian theology, Odozor examines responses of African theologians to African tradition and Christian responses to the reality of non-Christian religions. In a context where the African religious experience and heritage are powerful sources of meaning and identity, Christian evangelization raises questions both about the African primal religions and about Christianity itself and its claims. Odozor takes up the subject of moral reasoning in an African Christian theological ethics and concludes with case studies that show how the African Church has tried to inculturate moral discourse on a religiously pluralistic continent and relate the healing gospel message to African situations. Students and scholars of moral theology and ethics and church leaders will profit from the issues raised in Morality Truly Christian, Truly African.

And what interests him most about these people is their humanity, in all its glorious complexity. They get angry--at God for demanding so much, and at people, for doing so little. They make mistakes. They get frustrated. But through it all one constant remains--their love for the people they have been charged to teach and their devotion to the Supreme Being who has sent them. In these tales of battles won and lost, of exile and redemption, of despair and renewal, we learn not only by listening to what they have come to tell us, but by watching as they live lives that are both grounded in earthly reality and that soar upward to the heavens.From the Hardcover edition.

Fifty years after the foundation of the series EPRO, the volume aims to avoid the division between the supposedly ""Roman"" or ""Graeco-Roman"" and the ""Oriental"" by linking the available information relating the different major areas, such as the relation between local and global, the place of emotions in relation to soteriological and initiatory aspects, strategies of integration and negotiation of identities. For the first time the leading specialists in every field bring their approaches into contact with one another, and jointly construct a picture of practices and conceptual frames, which, in their diversity and inter-action, model a religious universe whose complexity will help to understand our modern globalising world.--Back cover.

B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.|Language English|Pages 448,"This Handbook presents the reader with a comprehensive, clear and stimulating guide to the world's religions, past and present. It is divided into seven sections: The development of religion; The ancient religions : Egypt, Greece, Rome ... The primal religions, illustrated with case studies from many different parts of the world today; Living religions of the East: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Parsis, Sikhs... People of a book: Judaism, Islam; Religion: or the fulfilment of relilgion? : Christianity; Rapid fact-finder. On the major Eastern and world religions, articles give information on the history, scriptures, worship, beliefs and practices of the various faiths. More than 50 specialist authors from many different countries have contributed to the Handbook. The aim has been to describe each faith clearly and objectively, 'as it is'. The evidence is presented: the response -- whether the faiths of mankind are being studied simply from academic interest or as part of a deep, personal search -- is left to the reader. This Handbook, like its best-selling predecessors, is fully illustrated throughout. It contains more than 200 photographs, 100 in full colour. Information is also presented in visual form by maps and charts. The Rapid Fact-finder section and Index make it an ideal reference book. - Jacket flap.

Written by a range of scholarly contributors, this three-volume set provides contextual background information and detailed explanations of religious controversies across the globe. Controversies in Contemporary Religion: Education, Law, Politics, Society, and Spirituality is a three-volume set that addresses a wide variety of current religious issues, analyzing religion's role in the rise of fundamentalism, censorship, human rights, environmentalism and sustainability, sexuality, bioethics, and other questions of widespread interest. Providing in-depth context and analysis far beyond what's available in the news or online, this work will enable readers to understand the nature of and reasons for controversies in current headlines. The first volume covers theoretical and academic debates, the second looks at debates in the public square and ethical issues, while the third examines specific issues and case studies. These volumes bring detailed and careful debate of a range of controversies together in one place, including topics not often covered—for example, how religions promote or hinder social cohesion and peace, the relationship of religions to human rights, and the intersection of Buddhism and violence. Written by a range of experts that includes both established and emerging scholars, the text explains key debates in ways that are accessible and easy to understand for lay readers as well as undergraduate students researching particular issues or global religious trends. Features: Provides detailed coverage of a broad range of religious controversies and issues in a single resource; Offers analysis and context from authorities in their fields that goes beyond the often simplified presentations of religious controversies in modern media; Supplies insight into key religious issues that underpin international current events, enabling readers a greater understanding of the root causes of the acrimony and contention regarding seemingly secular issues. - Publisher.

The notion of woman as the Devil's accomplice is prominent throughout Christian history and has been used to legitimize the subordination of wives and daughters. In the nineteenth century, rebellious females performed counter-readings of this misogynist tradition. Lucifer was reconceptualized as a feminist liberator of womankind, and Eve became a heroine. In these reimaginings, Satan is an ally in the struggle against a tyrannical patriarchy supported by God the Father and his male priests. Per Faxneld shows how this Satanic feminism was expressed in a wide variety of nineteenth-century literary texts, autobiographies, pamphlets, newspaper articles, paintings, sculptures, and even artifacts of consumer culture like jewelry. He details how colorful figures like the suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, gender-bending Theosophist H. P. Blavatsky, author Aino Kallas, actress Sarah Bernhardt, anti-clerical witch enthusiast Matilda Joslyn Gage, decadent marchioness Luisa Casati, and the Luciferian lesbian poetess Renée Vivien embraced these reimaginings. By exploring the connections between esotericism, literature, art and the political realm, Satanic Feminism sheds new light on neglected aspects of the intellectual history of feminism, Satanism, and revisionary mythmaking.

Modern Physics and Ancient Faith,Stephen M. Barr,religion,First published in 2003,/works/OL9155323W?edition=ia%3Amodernphysicsanc00step,/authors/OL2836255A/Stephen_M._Barr,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9561549M-M.jpg,"Publish Date March 1, 2003|Publisher  University of Notre Dame Press|Language English|Pages 328","A considerable amount of public debate and media print has been devoted to the “war between science and religion.” In his accessible and eminently readable new book, Stephen M. Barr demonstrates that what is really at war with religion is not science itself, but a philosophy called scientific materialism. Modern Physics and Ancient Faith argues that the great discoveries of modern physics are more compatible with the central teachings of Christianity and Judaism about God, the cosmos, and the human soul than with the atheistic viewpoint of scientific materialism.  Scientific materialism grew out of scientific discoveries made from the time of Copernicus up to the beginning of the twentieth century. These discoveries led many thoughtful people to the conclusion that the universe has no cause or purpose, that the human race is an accidental by-product of blind material forces, and that the ultimate reality is matter itself. Barr contends that the revolutionary discoveries of the twentieth century run counter to this line of thought. He uses five of these discoveries—the Big Bang theory, unified field theories, anthropic coincidences, Gödel’s Theorem in mathematics, and quantum theory—to cast serious doubt on the materialist’s view of the world and to give greater credence to Judeo-Christian claims about God and the universe.  Written in clear language, Barr’s rigorous and fair text explains modern physics to general readers without oversimplification. Using the insights of modern physics, he reveals that modern scientific discoveries and religious faith are deeply consonant. Anyone with an interest in science and religion will find Modern Physics and Ancient Faith invaluable.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sin embargo, la política contemporánea parece seguir un camino prácticamente opuesto. Nos hallamos ante un auténtico ataque contra la razón, liderado por la administración de George W. Bush, que tiende a ignorar las opiniones de los expertos, ya sea sobre el número de tropas necesarias en Irak, el cambio climático o el déficit público, y evita el proceso normal de debate y toma de decisiones para apoyar políticas específicas de raíz ideológica. Al Gore explica cómo una política basada en el miedo, el secretismo, el partidismo y la fe ciega, combinada con la degradación del debate público, ha creado un entrono hostil para la razón, la lógica y la verdad, que desempeñan un papel cada vez más reducido en el modo en que los Estados Unidos toma las decisiones más importantes.--Desde la descripción de la editorial.  An analysis of the consequences of the Bush administration's fear, secrecy, and faith-based initiatives explains how the administration has dangerously compromised America's capacity for addressing long-term challenges.

From a shanty school shared with Buddhists and Muslims in Bangkok's squatter slums, Father Joe Maier began his advance on abject poverty. Today, his Human Development Foundation and Mercy Centre charity is responsible for thirty-two preschools that have taught more than twenty thousand children how to read and write. Despite the crippling neglect found in impoverishment, he is raising international scholars and injecting a sense of purpose into shantytowns and squatter camps that used to have neither.

The child Moses grows to adulthood in the royal house of Ramses II, surrounded by the political factions, sending, but not fully understanding, the paradox of his singular posision.Through the strikingly contrasting events of Moses' epic life, Howard Fast traces the growth of his character as a biblical hero.  An outsider in the court of Egypt, Moses sees the corruption and decadence of the royal family for what it is.  Their autocracy acts as a forge for his moral character.Fast takes us into the white house above the first cataract as Moses experiences his first love; watches as Moses endures the savage Egyptian campaigning against the black men of Kush; and recalls the young man's rebellion against the Egyptian priesthood.Renouncing his royal trappings, Moses casts his lot with his own enslaved people, the Jews, and becomes, for all time, an inspiration to the world.

By foiling her plot to blow up their school, the boys of the Hebetheus will command the world's attention, show a righteous religion as the only real tool to thwart terrorism, and become avenging heroes.But fate and faith have a twist in store for Jon as the captive girl they call Snake causes him to confront the reflection of what he's become in her eyes.

Two federal courts disallowed the creche because its religious impact in the taxpayer-supported display overstepped the constitutional boundary between church and state. In March 1984, the United States Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote in Lynch V. Donnelly overruled the lower courts, deciding that in the predominantly secular context of Pawtucket's display, the purpose and effect of the Nativity scene was not to promote religion, but only to acknowledge the spirit of the holiday season. The Christ Child Goes to Court traces the judicial history of a case that lasted more than two years and explores its implications for future issues concerning the relationship between religion and government.Wayne R. Swanson describes how this compelling constitutional issue polarized public opinion in Rhode Island and generated ""unimaginable vilification"" of the Roman Catholic judge who first ordered the creche removed. He reports the reactions of local citizens, which echoed the national debate on this issue. By carefully documenting the case's trek through the judiciary, Swanson illustrates the workings of the judicial process in the United States, the political nature of the courts, and how their interpretation of the Constitution helps to shape the development of public policy.An important conclusion of this critical examination of the courts' approach to a controversial church-state question is that judicial decisions are usually interim in nature and often lead to imperfect solutions. Lynch V. Donnelly did not solve the problems posed by government-supported Nativity scenes or other religious symbols. The controversy lives on and the courts continue to struggle with one of the most difficult First Amendment problems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The right of Americans to voice their beliefs without government approval or oversight is protected under what may well be the most honored and least understood addendum to the US Constitutionthe First Amendment. Floyd Abrams, a noted lawyer and award-winning legal scholar specializing in First Amendment issues, examines the degree to which American law protects free speech more often, more intensely, and more controversially than is the case anywhere else in the world, including democratic nations such as Canada and England. In this lively, powerful, and provocative work, the author addresses legal issues from the adoption of the Bill of Rights through recent cases such as Citizens United. He also examines the repeated conflicts between claims of free speech and those of national security occasioned by the publication of classified material such as was contained in the Pentagon Papers and was made public by WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden."" -- Publisher's website.

In this small book readers will discover Heart Yoga, which developed over the centuries in the Gelukpa tradition of the Dalai Lamas. The program presented here combines popular yoga exercises wtih special Tibetan poses, and methods of working from the inside to give a healthy and a happy heart. Roach discovered a number of previously unknown Tibetan works on yoga in the course of his ongoing efforts to find and preserve ancient Tibetan Buddhist texts. He discusses the ideas and insights presented in these texts and places them within the context of the Buddhist tradition. To help readers incorporate this ancient wisdom in their daily lives, he provides a specific regime of yoga postures and meditations. Combining instructive illustrations with the unique philosophical underpinnings of the Buddhist approach, Geshe Roach has created a unique program for yoga on a physical and spiritual level.From the Hardcover edition.

In2013, during a historic six-day meeting at a Tibetan monastery in southern India, the Dalai Lama gathered with leading scientists, philosophers, and monks for in-depth discussions on the nature of reality, consciousness, and the human mind. This eye-opening book presents a record of those spirited and wide-ranging dialogues, featuring contributions from prominent scholars like Richard Davidson, Matthieu Ricard, Tania Singer, and Arthur Zajonc as they address such questions as: Does nature have a nature? Do you need a brain to be conscious? Can we change our minds and brains through meditation? Throughout, the contributors explore the exciting and sometimes surprising commonalities between Western scientific and Tibetan Buddhist methods of perceiving, investigating, and knowing. Part history, part state-of-the-field, part inspiration for the future, this book rigorously and accessibly explores what these two investigative traditions can teach each other, and what that can tell us about ourselves and the world. -- Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Joeri Schrijvers's contemporary philosophy of religion takes up this question, originally posed by Reiner Schürmann and central to continental philosophy. The book navigates the work of thinkers who have addressed such metaphysical concerns, including Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Luc Nancy, Jean-Luc Marion, Peter Sloterdijk, Ludwig Binswanger, Jacques Derrida, and more recently John D. Caputo, Mary-Jane Rubenstein, and Martin Hägglund. Notably, Schrijvers engages both those who would deconstruct Christianity and those who remain within this tradition, offering an option that is ""between:"" between Christianity and atheism, between progressive and conservative, between faith and belief. Ultimately, Schrijvers confronts the end of metaphysics with a phenomenology of love and community, arguing for the radical primacy of togetherness.

But how is the atonement achieved in these events? This book offers an introduction to the doctrine of the atonement focused on the unity and diversity of the work of Christ. Johnson reorients current patterns of thought concerning Christ's work by giving the reader a unifying vision of the immensely rich and diverse doctrine of the atonement, offering a sampling of its treasures, and cultivating the desire to further understand and apply these riches to everyday life. Where introductions to the atonement typically favor one aspect of the work of Christ, or work with a set number of themes, aspects or theories, this book takes the opposite approach, developing the foundation for the multi-faceted nature of Christ's work within the being of God himself. It offers a grand unifying vision of Christ's manifold work. Specific elaborations of different theories of the atonement, biblical themes, and the work of different theologians find their place within this larger rubric""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now, Meredith Gould reintroduces these customs and rituals to modern Roman Catholics.  Using the liturgical calendar, The Catholic Home provides familiar and new ways to celebrate each season and its special days.  Gould reviews major holy days, select saints' days, familiar prayers, and suggests meaningful ways to prepare as a family for such sacraments as Baptism, Confirmation, First Eucharist, and Matrimony.This book includes a concise history of each ritual and clarifies the meaning behind it by highlighting celebrations of Catholic holidays from different parts of the globe.  Your family will learn to make Advent wreaths, Jesse trees, St. Lucy's crowns, King's cakes, All Souls altars, traditional foods, and participate in family devotions. Throughout The Catholic Home, Gould's down-to-earth practicality and sense of humor give the activities she describes modern relevance no matter how ancient their origins.  Excerpts from the official Catechism of the Catholic Church are included to illuminate Church doctrine on matters of faith and ritual.  This indispensable guide will appeal to Catholics young and old and inspire beloved family traditions to be handed down from one generation to the next.

They were Jesuit priests. Their aim was to achieve by force of argument what the Armada had failed to do by force of arms: return England to the Catholic Church.Eighteen years later their mission had been shattered by the actions of a small group of terrorists, the Gunpowder Plotters; they themselves had been accused of designing 'that most horrid and hellish conspiracy'; and the future of every Catholic they had come to save depended on the silence of an Oxford joiner, builder of priest-holes, being tortured in the Tower of London. 'God's Secret Agents' tells the story of Elizabeth's 'other' England, a country at war with an unseen enemy, a country peopled – according to popular pamphlets and Government proclamations – with potential traitors, fifth-columnists and assassins. And it tells this story from the perspective of that unseen 'enemy', England's Catholics, a beleaguered, alienated minority, struggling to uphold its faith. Ultimately, 'God's Secret Agents' is the story of men who would die for their cause undone by men who would kill for it.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Writing religion,Markus Dressler,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL20956160W?edition=ia%3Awritingreligionm0000dres,/authors/OL91116A/Markus_Dressler,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28390352M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 323,"""Markus Dressler tells the story of how a number of marginalized socioreligious communities, traditionally and derogatorily referred to as Kizilbas (""Redhead""), captured the attention of the late Ottoman and early Republican Turkish nationalists and were gradually integrated into the newly formulated identity of secular Turkish nationalists. In the late 1980s, the Alevis (roughly 15-20% of the population), at that time thought to be mostly assimilated into the secular Turkish mainstream, began to assert their difference as they never had before. As Dressler demonstrates, they began a revitalization and reformation of Alevi institutions and networks, demanded an end to social and institutional discrimination, and claimed recognition as a community distinct from the Sunni majority population. Both in Turkey and in countries with a significant Turkish migrant population, such as Germany, the ""Alevi question, "" which comprises matters of representation and relation to the state, as well as questions of cultural and religious location, has in the last two decades become a matter of public interest. Alevism is often assumed to be part of the Islamic tradition, although located on its margins - margins marked with indigenous terms such as Sufi and Shia, or with outside qualifiers such as 'heterodox' and 'syncretistic.' It is further assumed that Alevism is an intrinsic part of Anatolian and Turkish culture, carrying ancient Turkish heritage back beyond Anatolia and into the depths of the Central Asian Turkish past. Dressler argues that this knowledge about the Alevis, their demarcation as ""heterodox"" but Muslim, and their status as an intrinsic part of Turkish culture, is in fact much more recent. That knowledge can be traced back to the last years of the Ottoman Empire and the first years of the Turkish Republic, which was the decisive period of the formation of the Turkish nation state. Dressler contends that the Turkish nationalist reading of Alevism emerged as an anti-thesis to earlier Western interpretations. Both the initial Western/Orientalist discovery of the Alevis and their re-signification by Turkish nationalists are the cornerstones of the modern genealogy of the Alevism of Turkey. It is time, according to Dressler, for the origins of the Alevis to be demythologized""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Daoism and Anarchism: Critiques of State Autonomy in Ancient and Modern China,John A.

Treating anarchism as a critique of centralized state power, the work first examines radical Daoist thought from the 4th century BCE to the 9th century CE and compares Daoist philosophers and poets to Western anarchist and utopian thinkers. This is followed by a survey of anarchist themes in dissident thought in the People's Republic of China from 1949 to the present. A concluding chapter discusses how Daoist anarchism can be applied to any anarchist-inspired radical critique today.  This work not only challenges the usual ideas of the scope and nature of dissent in China, it also provides a unique comparison of ancient Chinese Daoist anarchism to Western anarchist. Featuring previously untranslated texts, such as the 9th century Buddhist anarchist tract, the Wunengzi, and essays from the PRC press, it will be an essential resource to anyone studying anarchism, Chinese political thought, political dissent, and political history.

Original Sin,Alan Jacobs,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL1849029W?edition=ia%3Aoriginalsincultu00jaco,/authors/OL221305A/Alan_Jacobs,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL19930498M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  HarperOne|Language English|Pages 286,"Essayist and biographer Alan Jacobs introduces us to the world of original sin, which he describes as not only a profound idea but a necessary one. As G. K. Chesterton explains, ""Only with original sin can we at once pity the beggar and distrust the king.""Do we arrive in this world predisposed to evil? St. Augustine passionately argued that we do; his opponents thought the notion was an insult to a good God. Ever since Augustine, the church has taught the doctrine of original sin, which is the idea that we are not born innocent, but as babes we are corrupt, guilty, and worthy of condemnation. Thus started a debate that has raged for centuries and done much to shape Western civilization.Perhaps no Christian doctrine is more controversial; perhaps none is more consequential. Blaise Pascal claimed that ""but for this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we remain incomprehensible to ourselves."" Chesterton affirmed it as the only provable Christian doctrine. Modern scholars assail the idea as baleful and pernicious. But whether or not we believe in original sin, the idea has shaped our most fundamental institutions—our political structures, how we teach and raise our young, and, perhaps most pervasively of all, how we understand ourselves. In Original Sin, Alan Jacobs takes readers on a sweeping tour of the idea of original sin, its origins, its history, and its proponents and opponents. And he leaves us better prepared to answer one of the most important questions of all: Are we really, all of us, bad to the bone?   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To give tender care and protection. 2. To encourage to grow, develop, thrive, and be successful.This beautifully describes what God's daughters so desperately need. In this heartfelt work, Lisa explains how women of all ages must awaken and restore their capacity to give and receive nurture.                 The need for this indelible force is far more urgent than we know. Is it possible we are too busy surviving to assure that the vulnerable among us thrive? Are we too guarded, wounded, and afraid to open our lives to the nurture of others? What can be done to reestablish this language of the feminine heart? It is time women are healed and empowered.                If you have never experienced nurture, this is your season. Lisa's stirring message shows you how to make these vital heart connections. We need each other's comfort and assurance as we define ourselves, find our voice, and begin to fulfill God's purpose on Earth.                 In Lisa's own words: ""There is such a resonance in my spirit . . . this is in fact our season to grow, develop, and thrive. Heaven is passionately and purposefully reconnecting with our wounded, war-torn earth and the people who inhabit her. In this season I believe the daughters of God will prove integral agents. Nurture is not expensive-it is expansive. The life of everyone enlarges when it is added. As this happens, we will cease to merely function-we will indeed flourish.""

In A People's History of Christianity, historian and religion expert Diana Butler Bass reveals an alternate history that includes a deep social ethic and far-reaching inclusivity: ""the other side of the story"" is not a modern phenomenon, but has always been practiced within the church. Butler Bass persuasively argues that corrective — even subversive — beliefs and practices have always been hallmarks of Christianity and are necessary to nourish communities of faith.In the same spirit as Howard Zinn's groundbreaking work The People's History of the United States, Butler Bass's A People's History of Christianity brings to life the movements, personalities, and spiritual disciplines that have always informed and ignited Christian worship and social activism.A People's History of Christianity authenticates the vital, emerging Christian movements of our time, providing the historical evidence that celebrates these movements as thoroughly Christian and faithful to the mission and message of Jesus.

By the time she was 20 years old, she had been indoctrinated into an extreme fundamentalist church. She even met and married a young man who became a minister in this cultlike congregation. The Homemade Atheist shares her step-by-step search for the honest answers that freed her from the mental slavery of extreme religion and allowed her to find a true happiness. Without malice, The Homemade Atheist invites readers to analyze why they believe what they believe (or don't believe) — exactly as the author did over a period of many years. It was no quick-and-easy step from faith to reason for the author, but her transformation provides a wealth of insights she now shares with readers. The book details why Betty and her husband left the fundamentalist congregation, and how she then belonged to an orthodox church for 15 years until her ongoing questioning and searching convinced her that religion holds no truth. Relating her years of research in an enjoyable-to-read manner better suited for kitchen table talk than academic publications, The Homemade Atheist offers readers a path to a satisfying nonreligious way of life.

Katharine Jefferts Schori, presiding bishop of The Episcopal Church, examines these connections as she looks at the intersections of faith with the major issues of our day: How does faith speak to poverty, climate change, the economy, health care, and what is the faith response? How can believers from many faith traditions find common ground while honoring the Divine, serving one another, and creating deeper community? How do we best use the resources of faith to connect us to the hearts of our neighbors and to the heart of God? -- Publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Effortlessly combining outlandish humor with big questions about mortality, ethics, and human weakness, Ron Currie, Jr., holds a funhouse mirror to our present-day world. God has inhabited the mortal body of a young Dinka woman in the Sudan. When she is killed in the Darfur desert, he dies along with her, and word of his death soon begins to spread. Faced with the hard proof that there is no supreme being in charge, the world is irrevocably transformed, yet remains oddly recognizable.

Contributors include Robert Jastrow, first chairman of NASA’s Lunar Exploration Committee and currently director of the Mount Wilson Institute; Rod Davies, formerly director of the Jodrell Bank Radio Astronomy Laboratories, UK; Owen Gingerich, senior astronomer, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; Paul Davies, recipient of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion; Sir John Haughton, former director general of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office; Lord Habgood, former archbishop of York; and science writers Kitty Ferguson and Gregg Easterbrook. The writers are drawn from eight countries and represent the Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu traditions. Most are scientists by profession, but also included are philosophers, theologians, and psychologists. Each chapter of this innovative, accessible book helps to expand our thinking in light of what is known at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Taken as a whole, this book presents a challenging understanding of God and of God’s interaction with the world and with ourselves.

The symposia in this stimulating collection reveal why, whether the discussions concern Hume on metaphysics and religion, ""true religion,"" religion and ethics, religion and superstition, or miracles. For some, Hume's criticisms of religion cannot withstand them, while others claim that Hume can be answered on his own terms. All responses to Hume determine the style and spirit in which one pursues philosophy of religion today.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Translating Wisdom, Shankar Nair reconstructs the intellectual processes that underlay these translations, traversing an exceptional linguistic scope including Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian materials. Using the 1597 Persian rendition of the Sanskrit Yoga Vāsiṣṭha as a case study, Nair traces the intellectual exchanges by which teams of Muslim and Hindu translators, working collaboratively and drawing upon their respective religio-philosophical traditions, crafted a novel lexicon with which to express Hindu philosophical wisdom in an Islamic Persian idiom. How did these translators find a vocabulary through which to convey Hindu, Sanskrit articulations of God, conceptions of salvation and the afterlife, Hindu ritual notions, etc., in Islamic Persian terms? How did these two communities of scholars devise a shared language with which to communicate and to render one another’s religious and philosophical views mutually comprehensible? Translating Wisdom illustrates how these early modern Muslim and Hindu scholars found the words and the means to put their traditions into conversation with one another, achieving a nuanced inter-religious and cross-philosophical dialogue significant not only to South Asia’s past, but also its present.

From Charles J. Chaput, author of Living the Catholic Faith and Render unto Caesar comes Strangers in a Strange Land, a fresh, urgent, and ultimately hopeful treatise on the state of Catholicism and Christianity in the United States. America today is different in kind, not just in degree, from the past. And this new reality is unlikely to be reversed. The reasons include, but aren't limited to, economic changes that widen the gulf between rich and poor; problems in the content and execution of the education system; the decline of traditional religious belief among young people; the shift from organized religion among adults to unbelief or individualized spiritualities; changes in legal theory and erosion in respect for civil and natural law; significant demographic shifts; profound new patterns in sexual behavior and identity; the growth of federal power and its disregard for religious rights; the growing isolation and elitism of the leadership classes; and the decline of a sustaining sense of family and community.

Apostasy and jewish identity in high middle ages Northern Europe,Simha Goldin,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL17928176W?edition=ia%3Aapostasyjewishid00gold,/authors/OL5384300A/Simha_Goldin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26500456M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 138,"The attitude of Jews living in the medieval Christian world to Jews who converted to Christianity or to Christians seeking to join the Jewish faith reflects the central traits that make up Jewish self-identification. The Jews saw themselves as a unique group chosen by God, who expected them to play a specific and unique role in the world.  This study researches fully for the first time the various aspects of the way European Jews regarded members of their own fold in the context of lapses into another religion. It attempts to understand whether they regarded the issue of conversion with self-confidence or with suspicion, and whether their attitude was based on a clear theological position, or on issues of socialisation.  The book will primarily interest students and lecturers of Jewish/Christian relations, the Middle Ages, Jews in the Medieval period, and inter-religious research.

They studied together and taught together. Witness chronicles the intimate conversations between these two men over decades, as Burger sought counsel on matters of intellect, spirituality, and faith, while navigating his own personal journey from boyhood to manhood, from student and assistant to rabbi and, in time, teacher. In this profoundly hopeful, thought-provoking, and inspiring book, Burger takes us into Elie Wiesel's classroom, where the art of listening and storytelling conspire to keep memory alive. As Wiesel's teaching assistant, Burger gives us a front-row seat witnessing these remarkable exchanges in and out of the classroom.

In this down-to-earth book, Ben Connelly sure-handedly guides us through the intricacies of Yogacara and the richness of the 'Thirty Verses.' Dedicating a chapter of the book to each line of the poem, he lets us thoroughly lose ourselves in its depths. His warm and wise voice unpacks and contextualizes its wisdom, showing us how we can apply its ancient insights to our own modern lives, to create a life of engaged peace, harmony, compassion, and joy. In fourth-century India one of the great geniuses of Buddhism, Vasubandhu, sought to reconcile the diverse ideas and forms of Buddhism practiced at the time and demonstrate how they could be effectively integrated into a single system. This was the Yogacara movement, and it continues to have great influence in modern Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. ""Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only,"" or 'Trimshika,' is the most concise, comprehensive, and accessible work by this revered figure. Vasubandhu's 'Thirty Verses' lay out a path of practice that integrates the most powerful of Buddhism's psychological and mystical possibilities: Early Buddhism's practices for shedding afflictive emotional habit and the Mahayana emphasis on shedding divisive concepts, the path of individual liberation and the path of freeing all beings, the path to nirvana and the path of enlightenment as the very ground of being right now. Although Yogacara has a reputation for being extremely complex, the ""Thirty Verses"" distills the principles of these traditions to their most practical forms, and this book follows that sense of focus; it goes to the heart of the matter-- how do we alleviate suffering through shedding our emotional knots and our sense of alienation? This is a great introduction to a philosophy, a master, and a work whose influence reverberates throughout modern Buddhism""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Perhaps not one of them is yet alive. It is possible that they may be among those who understand my ""Zarathustra"": how could I confound myself with those who are now sprouting ears?--First the day after tomorrow must come for me. Some men are born posthumously. The conditions under which any one understands me, and necessarily understands me--I know them only too well. Even to endure my seriousness, my passion, he must carry intellectual integrity to the verge of hardness. He must be accustomed to living on mountain tops--and to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as beneath him. He must have become indifferent; he must never ask of the truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him... He must have an inclination, born of strength, for questions that no one has the courage for; the courage for the forbidden; predestination for the labyrinth. The experience of seven solitudes. New ears for new music. New eyes for what is most distant. A new conscience for truths that have hitherto remained unheard. And the will to economize in the grand manner--to hold together his strength, his enthusiasm...Reverence for self; love of self; absolute freedom of self..... Very well, then! of that sort only are my readers, my true readers, my readers foreordained: of what account are the rest?--The rest are merely humanity.--One must make one's self superior to humanity, in power, in loftiness of soul,--in contempt.

Les communications réunies ici rassemblent six écrivaines appartenant à des aires linguistiques et culturelles différentes et analysent la façon dont elles appréhendent les grands textes fondateurs, dont elles s'approprient, transforment, voire subvertissent les mythes et représentations contenus dans la Bible (hébraïque et chrétienne) et le Coran. Entre imitation et rupture, familiarité et étrangeté, soumission et transgression, elles acquièrent une position authentique et autonome, en s'affirmant comme les héritières plus ou moins fidèles de la tradition. Au-delà du contenu des écrits, déterminé par la culture, l'histoire, et un vécu à chaque fois singulier, des convergences se dessinent, laissant ouvert le débat relatif à la spécificité de l'écriture féminine, indissociable, quoi qu'il en soit, d'un projet universel d'émancipation. Ces études sont en outre autant de témoignages d'une source inépuisable de significations et de l'étrange plasticité ou de cette ""vie posthume"" de textes millénaires qui décidément résistent à l'annexion définitive.

Followers have not only built and sustained the world's largest democracy but have also sustained one of the greatest philosophical streams in the world for more than three thousand years. So, what makes a Hindu? Why is so little heard from the real practitioners of the everyday faith? Why does information never go beyond clichés? Being Hindu is a practitioner's guide that takes the reader on a journey to very simply understand what the Hindu message is, where it stands in the clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, and why the Hindu way could yet be the path for plurality and progress in the twenty-first century.""--Book jacket.

On the Boundaries of American Evangelicalism seeks to account for the emergence of this coalition of moderate Protestants in the 1940s and 1950s, as distinct from fundamentalism on the right and liberalism on the left, and speculate on the reasons for the fracturing and decline of that coalition in the 1960s to the 1990s. Beyond recounting the history of postwar evangelicalism, this volume's contribution is to our understanding of how movements define their coalitional boundaries and how coalitions change and reconstitute their boundaries over time.

Almeida presents a powerful argument which holds that several widely believed and largely undisputed objections to the idea of the existence of God are in fact just philosophical dogmas. He challenges some of the most well-entrenched principles in philosophical theology, which have served as basic assumptions in influential apriori, atheological arguments. But most theists also maintain that the principles express apriori necessary truths, including those principles that are presumed to follow from the nature of an essentially omnipotent, essentially omniscient, essentially perfectly good and necessarily existing being. Among the atheological arguments that deploy these philosophical dogmas are the Logical Problem of Evil, the Logical Problem of the Best Possible World, the Logical Problem of Good Enough Worlds, the Problem of Divine Freedom, the Problem of No Best World, and the Evidential Problem of Evil. In Freedom, God, and Worlds Almeida claims that these arguments present no important challenge to the existence of an Anselmian God. Not only are these philosophical principles false, they are necessarily false. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Long estranged from symbol and sacrament, contemporary artists seem to have turned once again toa vision rooted in the sacred.  In an era marked culturally by world-weary cynicism and self-conscious irony, a new humanism may be emerging, one which aims to move beyond fragmentation and opposition to integration and unification.  The aim of this book is not to propose resurgence of religious iconography, but rather to give voice to long-suppressed - often maligned, and certainly professionally risky - positions informed by and reverberating with themes of the sacred.  The essays included here, by a range of scholars working on these issues today, originated as a lively and spirited session of the 2008 College Art Association anuuual conference. - Publisher info.

Lacey's 'dangerously real' retelling of Scripture vividly demonstrates that the Bible is packed full of stories, poems, and images that resonate with the big issues of today. This fresh paraphrase-come-running-commentary brings the text alive: Bible stories are retold as mini blockbusters; psalms as song lyrics; epistles as emails; Revelation as seen through a virtual reality headset.  Out with stale religious terms, here's a 'Bible' which talks today's language---gritty, earthy, and witty. Enough starting at Genesis with good intentions and getting lost in Leviticus-Lacey succeeds in revitalizing a classic work by focusing on the big picture: fast-forwarding through the 'slow-moving' bits with pace, passion, and energy to make the Bible a page turner.  Lacey's tour de force was created during a remarkable personal journey through terminal cancer: the stuff Bible stories are made of. This life-experience injects Lacey's take on Scripture with authenticity and authority---resonating with Bible characters who also wrestled with the big questions.  Purist alert: This is not THE Bible (capital B)... but it might just get you reaching for one.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Uttered by Jesus Christ, this profound question has presented an age old challenge to believers, skeptics, scholars, and rulers. In attempting to answer this question, The True Jesus goes straight to the unimpeachable source: the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Only in the Gospels, says author David Limbaugh, do we com face to face with the Son of God, Whose sublime teachings, miraculous actions, and divine essence leap off every page and into our hearts. In this book, Limbaugh combines the four Gospel stories into a unified account (though not, he humbly admits, a perfect harmony) and guides readers on a faith journey through the Four Evangelists' testimonies of the life of Jesus Christ. Along the way, Limbaugh shares his insights on Jesus' words and deeds as well as His unique nature as fully human and fully divine. In The True Jesus, you will learn: Why even the apostles failed to completely understand Jesus' true identity and mission until after his crucifixion. Why Jesus selectively revealed His divinity instead of consistently proclaiming it. The real basis for the rejection of Jesus' message by skeptics in His hometown and elsewhere. The historic events preceding Jesus' birth that providentially paved the way for Christianity. How Jesus' message utterly contradicted modern attempts to portray him as being non-judgmental.

36 arguments for the existence of God: a work of fiction,Rebecca Goldstein,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL14956539W?edition=ia%3A36argumentsforex0000gold_g9n4,/authors/OL31774A/Rebecca_Goldstein,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32774317M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Corvus|Language English,"After Cass Seltzer's book becomes a surprise best seller, he's dubbed ""the atheist with a soul"" and becomes a celebrity. He wins over the stunning Lucinda Mandelbaum, ""the goddess of game theory,"" and loses himself in a spiritually expansive infatuation. A former girlfriend appears: an anthropologist who invites him to join in her quest for immortality through biochemistry. And he is haunted by reminders of the two people who ignited his passion to understand religion: his mentor and professor--a renowned literary scholar with a suspicious obsession with messianism--and an angelic six-year-old mathematical genius who is heir to the leadership of a Hasidic sect. Each encounter reinforces Cass's theory that the religious impulse spills over into life at large.36 Arguments for the Existence of God plunges into the great debate of our day: the clash between faith and reason. World events are being shaped by fervent believers at home and abroad, while a new atheism is asserting itself in the public sphere. On purely intellectual grounds the skeptics would seem to have everything on their side. Yet people refuse to accept their seemingly irrefutable arguments and continue to embrace faith in God as their source of meaning, purpose, and comfort. Through the enchantment of fiction, award-winning novelist and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Newberger Goldstein shows that the tension between religion and doubt cannot be understood through rational argument alone. It also must be explored from the point of view of individual people caught in the raptures and torments of religious experience in all their variety.Using her gifts in fiction and philosophy, Goldstein has produced a true crossover novel, complete with a nail-biting debate (""Resolved: God Exists"") and a stand-alone appendix with the thirty-six arguments (and responses) that propelled Seltzer to stardom.From the Hardcover edition.

Assuming little or no familiarity with the religious concepts it addresses, it provides a well-balanced and accessible approach to the field. The articles cover the standard topics, including religious experience, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, and miracles, as well as topics that have gained the attention of philosophers of religion in the last fifteen years, such as reformed as epistemology, the philosophical analysis of theological doctrine, and the kalam theological argument. The collection also includes topics often requested by instructors but seldom covered in competing texts, such as religion and science, religious pluralism, process theism, and religious ethics, offering greater flexibility in choosing exact topics for use in courses. The format of the book makes it an ideal teaching text, as each section begins with a brief introduction to the central topic or issue treated by the readings which follow. Each reading is preceded by a paragraph summary, and a bibliography of suggested readings follows each section. Philosophy of Religion functions well as a stand-alone textbook for courses in the philosophy of religion, and is readily compatible for use as a primary source reader in conjunction with a secondary text.

Toews had a knack for being the last person to speak on an issue. Some of us wondered: was it exquisite timing that gave him the final word at the microphone? Or was it just that after he had spoken there was nothing left to say?  This book may be JB's ""last word"" to his beloved church. In the first instance it is a personal testimony, a memoir of his life. But it is more than that. It is a particular kind of life, a life lived as a Mennonite Brethren.  In this volume, a companion to his earlier book, A Pilgrimage of Faith, JB's life is a lens that projects a fresh view of the Mennonite Brethren past. The book purports to be an autobiography, but JB's passion for the church is so all-consuming that the lines between denominational and personal history are not always sharp.  About the title: The shorthand of initials was common in earlier times when biblical names like Abraham, Jacob, John, and Peter would cover most of the men in a Russian Mennonite village. Initials like AH, BB, JJ, JA, and HH were a kind of conference code that brought immediate recognition.  J.B. Toews is one of those. Throughout the Mennonite Brethren Conference he is affectionately known as, simply, JB. There's no confusing him with anyone else because he's one of a kind.  --Wally Kroeker, from the Foreword   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Following an interdisciplinary approach, the study uses literary, inscriptional, and archaeological evidence to examine Roman conceptions of angels, how residents of the empire venerated angels, and how Christian authorities responded to this potentially heterodox aspect of Roman religion. The book brings together the evidence for popular beliefs about angels in Roman religion, demonstrating the widespread nature of speculation about, and veneration of, angels in the Roman Empire.

Like Jesus, McElvaine uses lively illustrations and a serious sense of humor to cleanse the temple of exclusive and exploitative religion."" --The Reverend Alan Storey,Calvary Methodist Church, South Africa""We're mad as Heaven, and we're not going to take it anymore!"" declares historian Robert McElvaine in this passionate and often hilarious rallying cry for sincere Jesus Followers. He lets the rest of society know that the extreme right wing won't be allowed to speak for all Christians any longer. His whip-smart, take-no-prisoners polemic lays bare the Christian Right's ""Easy Jesus"" creed, in which people who claim to accept Jesus get a free pass to lie in his name. Grand Theft Jesus exposes the televangelists and the leaders of megachurches as the people Jesus warned us about--the wolves in sheep's clothing of our day.The religion that McElvaine calls ChristianityLite resembles schemes that promise ""Lose weight without diet or exercise!"" Its leaders say, ""Be saved without sacrifice or good works!"" Run by a crew of politicians, megachurch preachers, televangelists, hypocrites, and snake-oil salesmen, it has hijacked true Christianity and distorted it into something Jesus wouldn't recognize. Its leaders have taken the generous and loving ideals of Christ and twisted them into a religion that advocates war and intolerance, values money above charity, preaches hatred instead of brotherhood, and promises ""true"" believers the keys to the gates of the kingdom of God--and to the bank vault. Jesus' radical message of love and peace has been drowned out by the bluster, the hate, and the selfishness that often passes for Christianity in America. McElvaine names names in his list of ""Leading Lites"" who have earned spots on Jesus' Ten Most Unwanted List and exposes the hypocritical (Ted Haggard), the disgraceful (Pat Robertson), and the shocking (Ann Coulter). Grand Theft Jesus blends outrage and humor in a compelling argument that will help to resurrect the real Jesus, who has been crucified and interred by the ""Right Reverends"" who recite the Apostles' Greed, are pro-choice on wars of choice, and preach the Greater Gory of Christ.From the Hardcover edition.

Es la perspectiva que condujo a calificar esta obra como ""el libro más bello escrito hasta ahora sobre el tema, el más original y el más vivo"". Era la línea iniciada por F. Cumont, su maestro, continuada y consagrada por G. Dumézil y M. Eliade, con los que estuvo muy vinculado. Es un libro clásico para el conocimiento de la religión de ese pueblo que dominó todo el mediterráneo y cuyo encuentro con el cristianismo configura nuestra historia y nuestra cultura. Nuestra edición se ha basado en su segunda edición de 1969 sobre la que se ha actualizado en su aspecto bibliográfico. Ofrecemos así un libro vivo pero con todo el valor del prestigio indiscutible.

Focusing on Muslim women in the organisation MJD in Germany, it provides a deeper understanding of processes related to immigration, transnationalism, the transformation of identifications and the reconstruction of selfhood. The book deals with the collective content of religious identity formation and processes of differentiation, engaging with the changing role of religion in an urban European setting, restructuring of religious authority and the formation of gender identity through religion. Synnøve K.N. Bendixsen examines how the participants seek and debate what it means to be a good Muslim, and discusses the religious movement as individual engagement in a collective project.

In this book, comparative theologian Marianne Moyaert argues that Ricoeur'ss hermeneutical philosophy offers valuable signposts for a better understanding of the complexities related to interreligious dialogue. By revisiting the key insights of Ricoeur's wider oeuvre from the perspective of interfaith dialogue, Moyaert elaborates a Ricoeurian interreligious hermeneutic. In Response to the Religious Other provides a coherent interreligious reading of Ricoeur's philosophy of religion, his hermeneutical anthropology, his ethical hermeneutics. Moyaert shows that Ricoeur makes an exceptionally rewarding conversation partner for anyone wishing to explore the complex issues associated with interreligious dialogue. This book is essential for studies of hermeneutics, ethics, religious philosophy, global cooperation and hospitality, comparative theology, and religious identity. -- Provided by publisher.

On a spring day more than ten years ago, sixty-nine-year-old Lloyd Lawrence was gunned down in rural Missouri. The shooter also turned his twelve-gauge shotgun on Lawrence's wife and their paraplegic grandson. The crime took place in a region known mostly for Pentecostal fervor, country music, and family-friendly tourism. But soon the murders would expose a dark underbelly in the Ozarks: Lloyd Lawrence was a notoriously violent crystal-meth kingpin, killed by an aspiring drug dealer named Darrell Mease.Capturing the raw circumstances that took Mease from his clean-cut youth to the front lines of Vietnam and an aftermath of drug use, Almost Midnight unites an unforgettable range of characters in some of America's most peculiar locales. When Mease and his girlfriend fled to the Southwest on a hair-raising road trip, this only brought Mease closer to death row. After his conviction, he claimed to receive a religious revelation guaranteeing that his life would be saved by miraculous intervention, a long-shot prediction that came true. A bizarre twist of fate brought Pope John Paul II to Saint Louis, where he pleaded with Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan to commute the sentence just months before Carnahan's fatal plane crash. In a triumph of investigative journalism, Michael Cuneo gained unprecedented access to Mease and immersed himself in the culture of the Ozarks, exploring its bucolic farms and seedy strip joints, and the lives of its preachers, cockfighters, and outlaws. By turns chilling and riveting, Almost Midnight brilliantly evokes the life of controversial renegade Mease, and the stranger-than-fiction world he still inhabits.

I contributi raccolti in questo libro, pur avvalendosi del dibattito contemporaneo sul rapporto tra donne e sacerdozio, in qualche misura lo travalicano, in una prospettiva storica di long durée che aiuta ad intravedere continuità, mutamenti e fratture, norme e disciplinamento, non conformismo e scelte di liberà. L'attenzione è stata rivolta alle pratiche delle donne piuttosto che alle narrazioni degli uomini, una scelta consapevole, che ha voluto far entrare in scena, e valorizzare, le esperienze religiose femminili e i  loro discorsi.    Incontreremo quindi le discepole, le apostole, le diaconesse del tempo di Gesù e delle comunità delle origini; poi le profetesse, le mistiche, le predicatrici e le donne delle eresie del Medioevo e della prima età moderna, per arrivare infine al tempo in cui alcune donne contestarono i meccanismi di discriminazione messi in atto nei loro confronti all'interno delle comunità religiose: una premessa storica poco nota delle rivendicazioni dei diritti civili e politici, contro una esclusione sovente giustificata dalla interpretazione tradizionale della Bibbia.    Il volume mette in evidenza una questio nodale che sottende il mistero sacro delle donne cristiane e riguarda in gran parte il modello di riferimento: ministero consacrato o ""sacerdozio santo"" di tutti i credenti? Queste due vie hanno segnato la vita religiosa di molte donne, ponendosi a fondamento di scelte che hanno condotto a pratiche differenti, e a differenti esiti dottrinari.

They are local, like Vindhyavasini, and global, like Kali; ancient, like Saranyu, and modern, like ""Mother India.""

Included here are the letters Lewis wrote to such luminaries as J.R.R. Tolkien, Owen Barfield, Arthur C. Clarke, Sheldon Vanauken, and Dom Bede Griffiths. To some particular friends, such as Dorothy L. Sayers, Lewis wrote fifty letters alone. The letters deal with all of Lewis's interests—theology, literary criticism, poetry, fantasy, children's stories—as well as his relationships with family members and friends.   The third and final volume begins with Lewis, already a household name from his BBC radio broadcasts and popular spiritual books, on the cusp of publishing his most famous and enduring book, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which would ensure his immortality in the literary world. It covers his relationship with and marriage to Joy Davidman Gresham, subject of the film Shadowlands, and includes letters right up to his death on November 22, 1963, the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated.

But while her friends were heading off to college or finding their first jobs, Karol decided to enter the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Cross. Those years were a time of enormous change in the country and in the Church. They were times of joy, dedication, and a great deal of fun, set against the Second Vatican Council and the reforms it fostered, many of which remain controversial today. In this playful and candid memoir, Jackowski pulls back the curtain on the mysteries of convent life, as she recounts her rocky transition from worldly teenager to cloistered postulant; the trials she faced in coping with the restrictions of convent life; and the lessons she learned from the elderly nuns she was assigned to, who weren't nearly as pious as people thought.--From publisher description.

This follow-up message discusses in greater detail the specific steps to take in making this scriptural passage part of your prayer life. For each of the prayer's four sections, Wilkinson explains important biblical distinctions, answers misconceptions about the prayer, offers practical steps to praying the prayer, and shows potential results in readers' lives. New content, exciting Jabez-inspired stories, and enriched commentary from Dr. Wilkinson make this a must-have for anyone who wants to live a world-changing life for God.Go Deeper.  Farther.  BEYOND.  When people passionately pray, God doesn't just listen. He responds!  Where the #1 New York Times bestseller The Prayer of Jabez left off, Beyond Jabez picks up and goes even deeper.Priceless testimonies of answered prayer and bold, biblical teaching clear up the misconceptions surrounding this once little-known prayer. Is it really right to ask God to bless me? How can I experience the miracles accompanying a Jabez lifestyle? The answers inside will destroy doubt and sound the trumpet blast announcing a glorious new chapter in your walk with the Lord!  Are you ready? Because God is still moving--and asking you to do the same!  Inside Left Flap  Dare to Go There.  True Stories  When The Prayer of Jabez sold nine million copies in two years, Bruce Wilkinson's mailbox was flooded with countless personal stories of answered prayer. God's mighty hand was using the prayer to change lives in both small and dramatic ways. Such undeniable testimonies make it impossible to ignore God's presence, active and alive today!  Refreshing Clarity  Beyond Jabez examines the larger biblical context of the once little-known prayer found in 1 Chronicles 4:9--10. Wilkinson's sound instruction answers the skepticism surrounding the Jabez phenomenon and returns an awesome sense of wonder to the miracle of prayer.  Deeper Application  Packed with practical guidance from a man who daily prays Jabez's prayer--and has for more than thirty years!-- Beyond Jabez reveals how, with a sincere heart and a devoted prayer life, God can use you mightily for His purposes!  Story Behind the BookBruce Wilkinson spent thirty years studying and praying the prayer of Jabez. The original manuscript was over three hundred pages long. When The Prayer of Jabez was released in the spring of 2000, it had been culled down to 96 pages. It was originally intended as a gift from Bruce to the attendees of the 2000 National Day of Prayer. Now in 2005, the fifth anniversary of the release of the original Prayer of Jabez, the release of Beyond Jabez will be more like the book Bruce Wilkinson originally intended to write--a book with more teaching, stories of God's blessings, and more application of what God intended of us in petitioning Him.From the Hardcover edition.

Then it sets off another frenzied wave of commentary about the inherent evils that lurk within the Muslim faith. From Fox News talking heads, who regularly smear Muslim leaders as secret terrorists, to Bill Maher, who has made Islam a routine target, it has become widely acceptable to libel a religion with a following of over 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world's population. Now popular commentator Arsalan Iftikhar--better known as The Muslim Guy""--offers a spirited defense of his faith that is certain to win him wide acclaim--and yes, another round of overheated scolding from the usual media quarters. Iftikahr's spirited defense of his faith is certain to hit a chord during the 2016 campaign season, as politicians and pundits vie to be the toughest on the block when it comes to escalating the hostilities in the Middle East, often demonizing Islam in the process. With his witty and levelheaded demeanor, the author will cut through all the sound and fury as a voice of sanity and reason.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Contributors explore the effects of US imperialist militarism on the formation of Asian and Asian American collective subjectivity and inter/intra subjectivity. The book investigates the ways in which Christianity (broadly defined), in its own complexity, has been complicit in maintaining and reinforcing US imperialist military agendas in both national and international contexts. Conversely, the volume also discusses the various sites and instances where Christianity has managed to serve as a force of resistance against US imperialist militarism.

What would you think if we told you that: All the horrors that marked the twentieth century were going to happen all over again. . This time the cruelties and casualties will be even greater, thanks to more advanced technologies. . The next mass atrocities will face less resistance, and generate fewer ""rescuers,"" because the West is even less hobbled by religious scruples about killing the innocent than it was in 1939. . The twenty-first century will be remembered not for Twitter, iTunes, expanding democracy, and the final dismantling of prejudice - but for total warfare, biological weapons, and the virtual disappearance of human rights as a concept.    That might be the ugly future, warn the authors of The Race to Save Our Century, unless modern man wakes up and recommits to fundamental moral truths that safeguard human rights and the common good.    In The Race to Save Our Century, human rights activist Jason Jones and political/economic scholar John Zmirak, combine to issue a stark warning to the West, and to call on readers to embrace and promote five core principles of a Culture of Life: . The innate dignity of every human person, regardless of race, age, or handicap. . The existence of a transcendent moral order, by which we judge the justice of all laws and policies.

Such a shift in many communities creates a challenge of church growth and church health when it seems that satisfying the needs of one group creates barriers to reaching another group. So many are asking, “How do you keep people over sixty years of age—who often hold church culture values—while at the same time reach people under forty—who often hold postmodern values?” If a church is interested in growing, this situation becomes a major challenge.Reaching People under 40 while Keeping People over 60 looks at the church as it seeks to function in a new world. It looks at the differences in the generations and at postmodernism—not just a generational difference but a global change. Most importantly Reaching People under 40 while Keeping People over 60 looks at what a church can do in this new age to help the church survive—and thrive!

Morrow,              William Morrow|Language English|Pages 265","On February 17, 1986, after years of addiction and self-destruction, Christopher Kennedy Lawford reached a turning point in his life, one that would mark the beginning of his long road to recovery. In his New York Times bestselling memoir, Symptoms of Withdrawal, he chronicled his deep descent into near-fatal drug and alcohol addiction, and his subsequent hard-won journey back to sobriety, which he has maintained for more than twenty years. The Before and the After. But before and after what? What happened at that point in time to trigger the understanding within himself that he had to change? What finally forces any person to choose life over death?The overwhelming response he received to his book impressed upon Lawford the number of people struggling to find their own way back from addiction and the need to share their stories. There was no easy way out for any of them. They all had to go through a moment of humility, vulnerability, and transformation and choose to take that first step of the journey. And each had their own intensely personal moment that signaled a Before and an After. The histories gathered here are the recollections of lives snatched back from the brink of a precipice so wide and deep it threatened to engulf them.Every segment of society has been touched by addiction and its aftermath. Moments of Clarity collects stories from men and women, young and old, and across all barriers of celebrity, color, and class. Represented in these pages are the singer and the actress, the writer and the anchorman, the man from the movie screen and the woman who lives down the street. A myriad of different moments but all with the common understanding of where these men and women have been and where they must go. As they bravely share their stories, they shed light not only on their own experiences but also on the journey we all take as human beings, looking to make sense of our world.

An empassioned defence of Sebond's fifteenth-century treatise on natural theology, it was inspired by the deep crisis of personal melancholy that followed the death of Montaigne's own father in 1568, and explores contemporary Christianity in prose that is witty and frequently damning. As he searches for the true meaning of faith, Montaigne is heavily critical of the arrogant tendency of mankind to create God in its own image, and offers his personal reflections on the true role of man, the need to eschew personal arrogance, and the vital importance of faith if we are to understand our place in the universe. Wise, perceptive and remarkably informed, this is one of the true masterpieces of the essay form.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here for the first time in one volume are the most important of Schuon’s chapters on the Christian tradition. The book is edited by James Cutsinger, who also edited Paths to the Heart: Sufism and the Christian East (World Wisdom, 2002) and Not of This World: A Treasury of Christian Mysticism (World Wisdom, 2003). The Fullness of God has been organized in such a way as to guide the reader from matters of metaphysical principle, through various theological and hermeneutical issues, to “operative” questions of spiritual practice and method. Specific topics include the relationship between Christianity and non-Christian religions; the divergence within Christianity between its main branches, Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant; the place of reason and faith in Christianity and their connection to spiritual knowledge or gnosis; the principles and applications of a mystical exegesis of Scripture; the central dogmas of the Trinity and Incarnation, as well as Eucharistic and Marian doctrine; and Christian initiation, contemplative practice, and “prayer of the heart.” The volume concludes with a short appendix of previously unpublished material, including samples from Schuon’s correspondence with various Christian seekers. Editor’s notes, a glossary of foreign terms, and a comprehensive index are also included to make this volume a very useful tool for students, as well as a rich mine for seekers after the sacred.Frithjof Schuon is best known as the foremost spokesman of the religio perennis and as a philosopher in the metaphysical current of Shankara and Plato. Over the past 50 years, he has written more than 20 books on metaphysical, spiritual and ethnic themes as well as having been a regular contributor to journals on comparative religion in both Europe and America. Schuon's writings have been consistently featured and reviewed in a wide range of scholarly and philosophical publications around the world, respected by both scholars and spiritual authorities alike.James S. Cutsinger is Professor of Theology and Religious Thought at the University of South Carolina. His recent works include Paths to the Heart: Sufism and the Christian East (2002), and Not of This World: A Treasury of Christian Mysticism (2003). The recipient of numerous teaching awards, he was honored in 1999 as a Michael J. Mungo University Teacher of the Year.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Gospel of Judas,National Geographic Society,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL15123791W?edition=ia%3Agospeljudas00kass,/authors/OL2641424A/National_Geographic_Society,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8536425M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 6, 2006|Publisher  National Geographic|Language English|Pages 192","For 1,600 years its message lay hidden. When the bound papyrus pages of this lost gospel finally reached scholars who could unlock its meaning, they were astounded. Here was a gospel that had not been seen since the early days of Christianity, and which few experts had even thought existed--a gospel told from the perspective of Judas Iscariot, history's ultimate traitor. And far from being a villain, the Judas that emerges in its pages is a hero.In this radical reinterpretation, Jesus asks Judas to betray him. In contrast to the New Testament Gospels, Judas Iscariot is presented as a role model for all those who wish to be disciples of Jesus. He is the one apostle who truly understands Jesus.This volume is the first publication of the remarkable gospel since it was condemned as heresy by early Church leaders, most notably by St. Irenaeus, in 180. Hidden away in a cavern in Middle Egypt, the codex (or book) containing the gospel was discovered by farmers in the 1970s. In the intervening years the papyrus codex was bought and sold by antiquities traders, hidden away, and carried across three continents, all the while suffering damage that reduced much of it to fragments. In 2001, it finally found its way into the hands of a team of experts who would painstakingly reassemble and restore it.The Gospel of Judas has been translated from its original Coptic in clear prose, and is accompanied by commentary that explains its fascinating history in the context of the early Church, offering a whole new way of understanding the message of Jesus Christ.

What does the biblical counseling process entail? What is the focus of each stage of the process? Lauren Whitman, an experienced CCEF counselor, addresses these questions and more in A Biblical Counseling Process, sharing a process from start to finish that will help guide counselors in reaching the hearts of their counselees and connecting them to Jesus, who brings hope and change. Although there is not a one-size-fits-all formula for biblical counseling, Whitman captures the scope of a counseling process and identifies two major tasks for the beginning, middle, and the end. Each of the chapters works together to explain, describe, support, and illustrate these tasks. The author also provides a case study that continues throughout the book, providing readers with an example of how to implement the process. As part of CCEF's Helping the Helper series, A Biblical Counseling Process will equip counselors, pastors, and lay leaders to approach their counseling ministry intentionally so that their work faithfully points people to the Lord, considers who he is, his heart, and what he calls us to. Useful for new and seasoned counselors alike, this resource will equip helpers with a vision for what a progression of counseling looks like. - Publisher.

Terms or names that point to the realm of mystery and depth that lies beyond our ordinary experience. (2.) The reality that is beyond even the power of beyond words to convey, and that can be known only by experiencing it for yourself.""A word a day to keep the demons at bay."" This is how Frederick Buechner likes to describe this witty and incisive dictionary. A daily devotional from one of today's greatest spiritual writers, Beyond Words offers 366 entries from Buechner's three alphabet books, Wishful Thinking, Peculiar Treasures, and Whistling in the Dark, including a new Introduction and nineteen new entries.Providing definitions of both sacred and ordinary words, as well as biblical characters, Buechner unabashedly brings his fresh perspective to words, concepts, and characters we thought we understood. This is a great introduction to Buechner's work as well as a library staple for those already well versed in his writing. It is Buechner at his best. Whether readers find themselves tearful from a deeply moving insight or laughing out loud at an unexpected turn of phrase, they will always feel uplifted, illuminated, and enchanted by the wisdom of Frederick Buechner.

During the same period, a new type of mysticism—popular with women—emerged that greatly affected the risk of possession and, as a result, the practice of exorcism. Many feared that in moments of rapture, women, who had surrendered their souls to divine love, were not experiencing the work of angels, but rather the ravages of demons in disguise. So how then, asks Moshe Sluhovsky, were practitioners of exorcism to distinguish demonic from divine possessions?Drawing on unexplored accounts of mystical schools and spiritual techniques, testimonies of the possessed, and exorcism manuals, Believe Not Every Spirit examines how early modern Europeans dealt with this dilemma. The personal experiences of practitioners, Sluhovsky shows, trumped theological knowledge. Worried that this could lead to a rejection of Catholic rituals, the church reshaped the meaning and practices of exorcism, transforming this healing rite into a means of spiritual interrogation. In its efforts to distinguish between good and evil, the church developed important new explanatory frameworks for the relations between body and soul, interiority and exteriority, and the natural and supernatural.

What is God?,Jacob Needleman,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL15066880W?edition=ia%3Awhatisgod0000need,/authors/OL394829A/Jacob_Needleman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24073839M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin|Language English|Pages 241,"In his most deeply personal work, religious scholar Needleman cuts a clear path through today's clamorous debates over the existence of God, illuminating an entirely new way of approaching the question of how to understand a higher power.I n this new book, philosopher Jacob Needleman— whose voice and ideas have done so much to open the West to esoteric and Eastern religious ideas in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries—intimately considers humanity's most vital question: What is God?Needleman begins by taking us more than a half century into the past, to his own experience as a brilliant, promising, Ivyeducated student of philosophy—atheistic, existential, and unwilling to blindly accept childish religiosity. But an unsettling meeting with the venerated Zen teacher D. T. Suzuki, combined with the sudden need to accept a dreary position teaching the philosophy of religion, forced the young academician to look more closely at the religious ideas he had once thought dead. Within traditional religious texts the scholar discovered a core of esoteric and philosophical ideas, more mature and challenging than anything he had ever associated with Judaism, Christianity, and the religions of the East.At the same time, Needleman came to realize—as he shares with the reader—that ideas and words are not enough. Ideas and words, no matter how profound, cannot prevent hatred, arrogance, and ultimate despair, and cannot prevent our individual lives from descending into violence and illusion. And with this insight, Needleman begins to open the reader to a new kind of understanding: The inner realization that in order to lead the lives we were intended for, the very nature of human experience must change, including the very structure of our perception and indeed the very structure of our minds.In What Is God?, Needleman draws us closer to the meaning and nature of this needed change—and shows how our present confusion about the purpose of religion and the concept of God reflects a widespread psychological starvation for this specific quality of thought and experience. In rich and varied detail, the book describes this inner experience—and how almost all of us, atheists and ""believers"" alike, actually have been visited by it, but without understanding what it means and why the intentional cultivation of this quality of experience is necessary for the fullness of our existence.

Michaelangelo's magnificent sculpture of him is perhaps the single best known work of art in the world, and the story of the humble shepherd whoslew Goliath and became king has assumed   a powerful mythological status. But was David a real person--and if so what kind of person was he?Through a close and critical reading of biblical texts, ancient history, and recent archeological discoveries, Steven L. McKenzie concludes that David was indeed a real person. This David, however, was no hero but a usurper, adulterer, and murderer--a Middle Eastern despot of a familiar type.McKenzie shows that the story of humble beginnings is utterly misleading: ""shepherd"" is a metaphor for ""king,"" and David came from a wealthy, upper-class background...

Rules for Retrogrades,Timothy J.

In the words of Shakespeare, a retrograde is one of God’s spies.  The retrograde has the unique capacity for understanding the stark chasm between the degenerate, socialist-infiltrated world of decay on one side and the well-meaning, good-hearted, but clueless Christian world on the other.  In a time of such profound decay, being one of God’s spies is a last resort and a pure necessity: it involves not “deep cover,”—i.e., acting like the enemy—but rather “half cover”: acting as a “contra” in the secular arena, a crypto-Christian counterinsurgent willing to fight like a Navy Seal and to think like a counterintel officer.  Retrogrades . . . to the streets: our aim is to reverse the deliberate, deuced machinations of “radicals” like Saul Alinsky who, by penning the rulebook of radicalism, threw down a challenge that has, until now, gone unanswered. Rules for Retrogrades is the handbook men of good will need to win the culture war! Here is a sampling from the call to action found within these pages:    No truth is “off-limits”; we must never be ashamed to be candid.    It is a damnable lie that humility disallows Christians from standing up (for what they believe) in the cultural and political forum!    Control of language is control of thought; don’t let radicals control the language.    Never trust a man who is unwilling to have enemies.    Radicals form coalitions but retrogrades form fellowships.    The root of cultural decay is feminism: end feminism to end radicalism.

Without the mediation of Christ Jesus, these two opposites continue to repel one another, whether it is in the Church, the workplace, or the home. Tenney calls for a forging together of the passion for God and compassion for man. The key is for God's people to cross ""the dividing line of passion and compassion"" and meet Him at the junction of the Cross - the single point in time and space where passion for His presence crosses with compassion for His highest creation.

Changes in the law over the past three decades, such as the spread of no-fault divorce and broad acquiescence to cultures of divorce and intentional childlessness, have stripped traditional marriage of important legal supports. Half of all marriages end in divorce and just as many are childless. Conjugal America seeks to recapture the real purposes of marriage and the unchanging nature of this most vital and fundamental human institution.Confronting contemporary issues and drawing heavily on the natural and social sciences, each chapter also reaches into the past to find truths grounded in human experience. Carlson reexamines the basic bond of marriage to procreation, showing that this tie has been no less than the foundation of the unwritten sexual constitution of Western civilization. He also shows how the Gnostic heresy, which despises procreation, posed a stark danger to the early Christian movement and to """"the sexual constitution"""" of our own time as well. He then dissects claims regarding the """"evolution of marriage,"""" showing that true marriage always represents the vital connection of the sexual with the economic.Carlson explores the political nature of marriage showing, why every ambitious totalitarian government seeks above all to destroy marriage, and why the true marital bond actually stands for liberty. He concludes by arguing for the necessity of marriage policy. Because both the nature of the centralizing state and the pressures of modernity have altered family circumstances, new protections and encouragements to marriage are now imperative. Conjugal America will be central to the new debate on marriage and its purposes. This book sees the current moment as an opportunity to revitalize a necessary institution that has recently been abused and neglected and reinstate it as the primary source of commitment and care in the modern world.

Stutley unravels the history, ideologies and rites of shamanism, demystifying practices such as:how the shaman's dual souls can roam the world of the deadwhy the Yukaghir people wear 'grandfather' amulets, made of dead relatives' flesh and boneshow the androgynous Chukchi shamans induce ritualistic sex changethe lost secret language of the Siberian shamans.Shamanism particularly explores the climatic, geographic and cultural pressures under which shamanic customs arose and continue to be observed.The fantastical in Shamanism has a special place in the popular imagination: this guide will appeal to those interested in alternative religions and spirituality as well as to students of religion and anthropology.

That's all she can think of when she asks her parents permission to spend the summer in Hawaii with Aunt Carole and her family.But Marne quickly realizes her visit isn't going to be just about learning to surf and morning runs along the beach, despite the cute surfer boy she keeps bumping into.

Nothing could be more foreign to Marne, and fitting into this new culture--and house full of kids--is a challenge. But as she settles into her newfound family's daily routine, she begins to think about spirituality, identity, and finding a place in the world in a way she never has before.This rich novel is a window into a different life and gets to the very heart of faith, identity, and family ties.From the Hardcover edition.

Just walk across the room,Bill Hybels,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL135897W?edition=ia%3Ajustwalkacrossro00hybe_1,/authors/OL43934A/Bill_Hybels,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3419145M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Zondervan|Language English,"What if you knew that by simply crossing the room and saying hello to someone, you could change that person's forever? Just a few steps to make an eternal difference. It has nothing to do with methods and everything to do with taking a genuine interest in another human being. All you need is a heart that's in tune with the Holy Spirit and a willingness to venture out of your 'Circle of Comfort' and into another person's life.    Just Walk Across the Room brings personal evangelism into the twenty-first century. Building on the solid foundation laid in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Bill Hybels shows how you can participate in the model first set by Jesus, who stepped down from heaven 2,000 years ago to bring hope and redemption to broken people living in a fallen world. Now it's your turn. Your journey may not be as dramatic, but it can have a life-changing impact for someone standing a few steps away from you---and for you as well, as you learn the power of extending care, compassion, and inclusiveness under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.    The highest value in personal evangelism is cooperating with the Spirit, says Hybels. This means playing only the role you're meant to play---walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when he says to talk, and falling silent when he suggests that you've said enough. Hybels encourages you to 'live in 3D' ...    ---Developing friendships     ---Discovering stories     ---Discerning appropriate next steps     ... as a means of learning to understand the Holy Spirit's promptings. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry, Bill Hybels shows with convincing and inspiring clarity the power of this personal, richly relational approach to evangelism.    The stakes are high. The implications are eternal. And you may be only a conversation away from having an eternal impact on someone's life---if you will just walk across the room.

In this book, customized science is defined as a science built according to - or altered and fitted to - a particular group's specifications, that is, its needs, interests or values, its political ideology or worldview. It is science governed not merely by goals such as increased knowledge and explanatory power, but also by goals such as economic growth, sustainable development, the equality of women or the end of religion. The contributions to this book discuss, with regard to particular worldviews and themes connected to the public role of science, whether science is increasingly becoming customized to fit the needs and interests of various groups in society, but also what the consequences of such a development may be both for science and society""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The theological education of the ministry,Alan P. F.

From the eighteenth century onwards, theological colleges devoted exclusively to ministerial education were founded, while in Scotland historically, and in England and Wales over the past 120 years, freestanding university faculties of divinity/theology have provided theological education to ordinands and others. These diverse educational contexts are all represented in this collection of papers, but the focus is upon those who taught in them: Caleb Ashworth (Daventry Academy); John Oman (Westminster [Presbyterian] College Cambridge); N. H. G. Robinson (University of St. Andrews); Geoffrey F. Nuttall (New [Congregational] College, London); T. W. Manson (University of Manchester); Owen Evans (University of Manchester and Hartley Victoria Methodist College)-the lone Methodist scholar discussed here; and W. Gordon Robinson and J. H. Eric Hull (University of Manchester and Lancashire Independent College). Between them these scholars covered the core disciplines of theological education: biblical studies, ecclesiastical history, philosophy, doctrine, and systematic theology.

Bruce Zuckerman argues that the book of Job was intended as a parody protesting the stereotype of the traditional righteous sufferer as patient and silent. He compares the book of Job and its fate to that of a famous Yiddish short story, ""Bontsye Shvayg,"" another covert parody whose protagonist has come to be revered as a paradigm of innocent Jewish suffering. Zuckerman uses the story to prove how a literary text becomes separated from the intention of its author, and takes on quite a different meaning for a specific community of readers. - Back cover.

How has the movement variously called Word of Faith, Health and Wealth, Name It and Claim It, or simply prosperity gospel come to dominate much of our contemporary religious landscape? Kate Bowler's Blessed is the first book to fully explore the origins, unifying themes, and major figures of a burgeoning movement that now claims millions of followers in America. Bowler traces the roots of the prosperity gospel: from the touring mesmerists, metaphysical sages, pentecostal healers, business oracles, and princely prophets of the early 20th century; through mid-century positive thinkers like Norman Vincent Peale and revivalists like Oral Roberts and Kenneth Hagin; to today's hugely successful prosperity preachers. Bowler focuses on such contemporary figures as Creflo Dollar, pastor of Atlanta's 30,000-member World Changers Church International; Joel Osteen, known as ""the smiling preacher,"" with a weekly audience of seven million; T. D. Jakes, named by Time magazine one of America's most influential new religious leaders; Joyce Meyer, evangelist and women's empowerment guru; and many others. At almost any moment, day or night, the American public can tune in to these preachers-on TV, radio, podcasts, and in their megachurches-to hear the message that God desires to bless them with wealth and health. Bowler offers an interpretive framework for scholars and general readers alike to understand the diverse expressions of Christian abundance as a cohesive movement bound by shared understandings and common goals. - Publisher.

How has Christianity for centuries served as an ideology of conquest and subjugation? Why is the ""Bible Belt"" in the U.S. also the ""lynching belt""? Why is there a rise of religious fundamentalism throughout the world? In the intensifying conflict between U.S. imperialism and Islamic fundamentalism, is the only choice to take one side or the other? Why is patriarchy and the oppression of women foundational to so many religions? Can people be good without god? These are just some of the questions explored in this provocative work by Bob Avakian.  Bringing a unique revolutionary communist voice to the current discourse about god, atheism and morality, Avakian demystifies religious belief and examines how, even in its most progressive interpretations, religion stands in the way of the emancipation of humanity. A thread deeply woven throughout Away With All Gods! is the need to fully rupture with all forms of superstition, and to take up instead a truly scientific approach to understanding and transforming reality.  Whether you believe in god, or are an agnostic or an atheist, Bob Avakian will challenge you with his powerful critique of long-established traditions and his liberating vision of a radically different world.

Nine lives: in search of the sacred in modern India,William Dalrymple,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL15119525W?edition=ia%3Aninelivesinsearc0000dalr,/authors/OL310865A/William_Dalrymple,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24080826M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  A.A. Knopf|Language English,"Three brothers from a remote village in the Himalayas are driven by poverty to become monks. One becomes a famous masked dancer; the second an accomplished player of the Tibetan temple trumpet; and the third a great Buddhist scholar. A Jain nun tests her powers of detachment as she watches her best friend ritually starve herself to death. A woman leaves her middle class family in Calcutta and her job in a jute factory, only to find unexpected love and fulfillment living as a tantric in a skull-filled hut in remote a cremation ground. A prison warder from Kerala becomes for two months of the year a temple dancer and is worshipped as an incarnate deity; then, at the end of February each year, he returns to prison. An idol maker, the thirty-fifth of a long line of sculptors going back to the legendary Chola bronze makers, regards creating Gods as one of the holiest callings in India, but has to reconcile himself to his son who only wants to study computer engineering. An illiterate goat herd from Rajasthan keeps alive an ancient 200,000-stanza sacred epic that he, virtually alone, still knows by heart. A devadasi – or temple prostitute – initially resists her own initiation into sex work, yet pushes both her daughters into a trade she regards as a sacred calling. Nine people, nine lives. Each one taking a different religious path, each one an unforgettable story.Exquisite and mesmerizing, and told with an almost biblical simplicity, William Dalrymple's first travel book in a decade explores how traditional forms of religious life in South Asia have been transformed in the vortex of the region's rapid change. Nine Lives is a distillation of twenty-five years of exploring India and writing about its religious traditions, taking you deep into worlds that you would never have imagined even existed.

Never had any country sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. At the center of this unprecedented attempt at healing a nation has been Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom President Nelson Mandela named as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. With the final report of the Commission just published, Archbishop Tutu offers his reflections on the profound wisdom he has gained by helping usher South Africa through this painful experience.In No Future Without Forgiveness, Tutu argues that true reconciliation cannot be achieved by denying the past.  But nor is it easy to reconcile when a nation ""looks the beast in the eye."" Rather than repeat platitudes about forgiveness, he presents a bold spirituality that recognizes the horrors people can inflict upon one another, and yet retains a sense of idealism about reconciliation. With a clarity of pitch born out of decades of experience, Tutu shows readers how to move forward with honesty and compassion to build a newer and more humane world.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Philosophical defences of theism have often been based on the idea that it explains things which atheistic approaches cannot: for example, why the universe exists, and how there can be objective moral values. The main contention of Arguing for Atheism is that the reverse is true: that in fact theism fails to explain many things it claims to. Such an interpretation has been argued for recently by 'radical theologians'; Arguing for Atheism is therefore, a philosophical contribution to one of the key religious issues of our times. Designed as a text for university courses in the philosophy of religion and metaphysics, this book's accessible style and numerous explanations of important philosophical concepts and positions will also make it attractive to the general reader.

On the Eternal in Man,Max Scheler,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL32328201W,/authors/OL5842197A/Max_Scheler,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis,              Taylor & Francis Group|Language English","""Max Scheler (1874-1928) decisively influenced German philosophy in the period after the First World War, a time of upheaval and new beginnings. Without him, the problems of German philosophy today, and its attempts to solve them would be quite inconceivable. What was new in his philosophy was that he used phenomenology to investigate spiritual realities. The subject of On the Eternal in Man is the divine and its reality, the originality and non-derivation of religious experience. Scheler shows the characteristic quality of that which is religious. It is a particular essence that cannot be reduced to anything else. It is a sphere that belongs essentially to humankind; without it we would not be human. If genuine fulfillment is denied it, substitutes come into being. This religious sphere is the most essential, decisive one. It determines man's basic attitude towards reality and in a sense the color, extent and position of all the other human domains in life. It forms the basis for various views about life and thought. Scheler was emphatically an intuitive philosopher. In Scheler's work the break between being as the almighty but blind rage and value as the knowing but powerless spirit-has become complete, and makes of each human a split being. Personal experiences may be reflected here. The development of Scheler's work as a whole was highly dependent on his personal experiences. It is this that gives Scheler's work its liveliness and its validity.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From praying in an early American synagogue to performing Mormon healing rituals to debating cremation, Volume 2 explores faith through action in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The documents and essays consider the religious practices of average people--praying, singing, healing, teaching, imagining, and persuading. Some documents are formal liturgies while other texts describe more spontaneous religious actions. Because religious practices also take place in the imagination, dreams, visions, and fictional accounts are also included. Accompanying each primary document is an essay that sets the religious practice in its historical and theological context--making this volume ideal for classroom use and accessible to any reader. The introductory essays explain the various meanings of religious practices as lived out in churches and synagogues, in parlors and fields, beside rivers, on lecture platforms, and in the streets. Religions of the United States in Practice offers a sampling of religious perspectives in order to approximate the living texture of popular religious thought and practice in the United States. The history of religion in America is more than the story of institutions and famous people. This anthology presents a more nuanced story composed of the everyday actions and thoughts of lay men and women.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through rigorously investigated case histories based upon the real-life experiences of converts, believers and defectors, it describes how the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society seek to achieve conformity in devotees, and to construct meaningful religious identities in a world whose excesses it vehemently reviles.Examining the Jehovah's Witnesses' dramatic expansion over the last 130 years, Andrew Holden reveals the dependency of this quasi-totalitarian movement on the very physical and cultural resources which have brought about the privatisation of religion, the erosion of community and the separation of 'fact' from supernatural faith. Asking vital questions about the ambivalent relationship of spiritual meaning to modern secular materialism, Jehova's Witnesses reconsiders the Witnesses' ascetic faith at once as an inverted form of pseudo-corporate 'branding', and as an anti-modern quest for certainty in a hostile world of relativism and risk.

Through interaction with the thought of Jürgen Moltmann, Oliver O'Donovan and Thomas Aquinas, it argues that human law is called to play a positive but limited role in maintaining ""shallow justice"" and relative peace. Human law is overshadowed by the work of the Son, included in the purposes of the Father, and used as an instrument by the Holy Spirit. However, the Spirit works in those who are in Christ to effect ""deep justice"", a work of sanctification which culminates in glorification - the experience of perfect, free, willing obedience in heaven. Thinking about law in the light of the Trinity enables us to understand its role, its purpose and its limits.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

F. Thurman: 9780271006017: Amazon.com: Books (link)  This book presents the major teachings of Mahayana Buddhism in a precise, dramatic, and even humorous form. For two millennia this Sutra, called the ""jewel of the Mahayana Sutras"" has enjoyed immense popularity among Mahayana Buddhists in India, central and southeast Asia, Japan, and especially China, where its incidents were the basis for a style in art and literature prevalent during several centuries. Robert Thurman's translation makes available in relatively nontechnical English the Tibetan version of this key Buddhist scripture, previously known to the English-speaking world only through translations from Chinese texts. The Tibetan version is generally conceded to be more faithful to the original Sanskrit than are the Chinese texts. The Tibetan version also is clearer, richer, and more precise in its philosophical and psychological expression. The twelve books of the Sutra are accompanied by an introduction and an epilogue by Dr. Thurman and by three glossaries: Sanskrit terms, numerical categories, and technical terms.

As a young child, she assumed everyone could see the otherworldly beings who always accompanied her. Yet in the eyes of adults, her abnormal behavior was a symptom of mental deficiency. Today, sick and troubled people from around the world are drawn to her for comfort and healing, and even theologians of different faiths seek her guidance. Lorna is trusted for her ability to communicate with spirits and angels--and by sharing her intimate knowledge of the spiritual world she offers a message of hope and love to us all. Angels in My Hair  is an engrossing chronicle of Lorna's incredible life story. Invoking a wonderful sense of place, she describes growing up poor in Ireland, finding work in Dublin, and marrying the man of her dreams--only to have the marriage cut short by tragedy. Already a bestseller in Ireland, her story gives readers a unique insight into the angelic help that is around us and available to us all the time. As Lorna says, ""All you have to do is ask.""In this uplifting autobiography, a modern-day Irish mystic shares her vivid encounters and conversations with the angels and spirits she has known her entire life.

S’il est indéniable que ces criminels démoniaques visent et menacent la civilisation dans son ensemble, les musulmans sont les premières victimes de leurs théories et de leurs pratiques cauchemardesques. » (Farid Gabteni)  Le Soleil se lève à l’Occident de Farid Gabteni est publié en trois tomes : Science pour l’Heure, Le Hasard Programmé et Au cœur du Qorân.

Allione-one of only a few female Buddhist leaders in this country and comparable in American religious life to Pema Chodron-bridges this ancient Eastern practice with today's Western psyche. She explains that if we fight our demons, they only grow stronger. But if we feed them, nurture them, we can free ourselves from the battle. Through the clearly articulated practice outlined in FEEDING YOUR DEMONS, we can learn to overcome any obstacle and achieve freedom and inner peace.

These essays bring to discussion topics from postmodernism, authenticity and iconoclasm to individualism, beauty, and truth. Each essay focuses on issues that relate to how artists of faith approach their thinking about art, how viewers can enhance their experience of artworks and the relationship between Postmodernism and Christianity. Campbell explores, within the current Postmodernist environment, how art and Christianity can be discussed in the present tense and how Art by Contemporary Christians is now a topic for serious discussion that cannot be dismissed as merely an oxymoron. These essays bring to discussion issues that have been ignored by mainstream art publications.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Like other religions in the United States, it has witnessed a decline in the number of participants over the past forty years, and many who remain active struggle to reconcile their hallowed traditions with new perspectives—from feminism and the LGBTQ movement to “do-it-yourself religion” and personally defined spirituality. Taking a fresh look at American Judaism today, Jack Wertheimer, a leading authority on the subject, sets out to discover how Jews of various orientations practice their religion in this radically altered landscape. Which observances still resonate, and which ones have been given new meaning? What options are available for seekers or those dissatisfied with conventional forms of Judaism? And how are synagogues responding?""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The volume examines instances of this phenomenon from ancient Rome to the modern day; it finds that religion-inspired violence is not restricted to Abrahamic faiths or to one geographic region. The fact that symbolically charged religious violence has destructive consequences is not lost on contributors to Faith, War, and Violence. Among the subjects tackled are: the ideological and religious foundations that inspired the founders of Al-Qaeda and its role in the Arab Spring; the long history of religious conflict in Ireland known as the Troubles; Sikh extremism; and the evolution of the Christian approach to war. As the contributors demonstrate, in Western societies, the unity of religious fervor and warmongering stretches from Constantine's incorporation of Christian symbols into Roman army flags to slogans like Gott mit uns (God is with us), which appeared on the belt buckles of German soldiers in World War I. In recent years, George W. Bush declared the war on terror a ""crusade,"" and his speechwriter, David Frum, coined the religiously inspired term ""Axis of Evil,"" to describe Iraq and other countries opposing the United States.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Far more than merely a philosophical opinion or the doctrine of a school, it has permeated the whole mind of society. This book analyzes the theory of progress in a panoramic study which examines the interrelation between religion and culture of all the major civilizations of the world. The author maintains that the vital, creative power behind every culture is a spiritual one. All civilizations have a common element, religion, ""the key to history"", which influences every human activity; and he specifically demonstrates that Christianity is the religion that gave Western culture its being. The rise of the theory of progress has led to the secularization of modern civilization and the decline of spiritual influence.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Allen & Unwin|Language English|Pages 216,"Originally published in 1979, Tales and Teachings of the Buddha aims   to further the work done by scholars like Gombrich, Spiro and Tambiah in their   field studies of lay Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. But whereas   they highlight the syncretistic mix of imported Buddhist with indigenous animistic   beliefs, Tales and Teachings demonstrates that within the Buddhist tradition   itself there is, in the immensely popular Jataka tales, a vast fund of folkloric   material that is much more congenial to the average layman than the more austere   teaching found in the canon proper. In this book, the two aspects of Buddhist   tradition are thoroughly explored, revealing the extent to which concessions   have been made by the monks to the laity and also the extent to which the monks   themselves have been influenced by the folk tradition in which they were reared.   The author has completely revised the book for this new edition, correcting    minor errors in the original, pruning dead wood, and incorporating   some helpful observations gleaned from reviews and correspondence.

The Foundations of Belief,Leslie Dewart,religion,First published in 1969,/works/OL4854782W?edition=ia%3Afoundationsofbel0000dewa,/authors/OL1031095A/Leslie_Dewart,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16773276M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1969|Publisher  Burns & Oates|Language English|Pages 526,"Dewart's new book is a work of fundamental theology, or of the philosophy of religion, and its purpose is to consider the question at the basis of the present-day """"crisis of faith"""": can the Christian faith be said truly to develop and unequivocally to evolve, assuming that that faith is true, and that its object is real? It is Dewart's belief that the Christian faith must evolve consciously if it is to survive, and that neither the traditional foundations of belief (as formulated in Aquinas' synthesis) nor contemporary thought can furnish the basis for that development. Instead, contemporary Christian thought must complete the work begun by Aquinas, and revise the achievements of contemporary philosophical and scientific thought, thereby achieving a new synthesis within the framework of which the """"conscious evolution"""" of a rational Christian belief could take place. The book, obviously, is complementary to Dewart's earlier The Future of Belief and, like that book, its implications will be considered outrageously radical by some, but as reliable guidelines for the future by most. Despite the complexity of the author's thought and the inherent difficulty of the material, this work, like its predecessor volume, will create a sensation both academic and popular. It should prove to be one of the most important, and probably one of the most successful, religious books of the year.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Rebuilding Zion,Daniel W.

Each side believed that its fight was just, that God favored its cause. Rebuilding Zion is the first study to explore simultaneously the reaction of southern white evangelicals, northern white evangelicals, and Christian freedpeople to Confederate defeat. As white southerners struggled to assure themselves that the collapse of the Confederacy was not an indication of God's stern judgment, white northerners and freedpeople were certain that it was. Author Daniel W. Stowell tells the story of the religious reconstruction of the South following the war, a bitter contest between southern and northern evangelicals, at the heart of which was the fate of the freedpeople's souls and the southern effort to maintain a sense of sectional identity. Central to the southern churches' vision of the Civil War was the idea that God had not abandoned the South; defeat was a Father's stern chastisement. Secession and slavery had not been sinful; rather, it was the radicalism of the northern denominations that threatened the purity of the Gospel. Northern evangelicals, armed with a vastly different vision of the meaning of the war and their call to Christian duty, entered the post-war South intending to save white southerner and ex-slave alike. The freedpeople, however, drew their own providential meaning from the war and its outcome. The goal for blacks in the postwar period was to establish churches for themselves separate from the control of their former masters. Stowell plots the conflicts that resulted from these competing visions of the religious reconstruction of the South. By demonstrating how the southern vision eventually came to predominate over, but not eradicate, the northern and freedpeople's visions for the religious life of the South, he shows how the southern churches became one of the principal bulwarks of the New South, a region marked by intense piety and intense racism throughout the twentieth century. - Publisher.

Here, new voices in the field are brought together with leading scholars such as William E. Connolly, Michael Barkun, Simon Dalby, and Paul Boyer to produce a timely examination of the spatial dimensions of the movement, offering useful and compelling insights on the intersection between politics and religion. This comprehensive study discusses evangelicalism in its different forms, from the moderates to the would-be theocrats who, in anticipation of the Rapture, seek to impose their interpretations of the Bible upon American foreign policy. The result is a unique appraisal of the movement and its geopolitical visions, and the wider impact of these on America and the world at large.

Richard Marsden and Ann Matter's volume provides a balanced treatment of eastern and western biblical traditions, highlighting processes of transmission and modes of exegesis among Roman and Orthodox Christians, Jews and Muslims and illuminating the role of the Bible in medieval inter-religious dialogue. Translations into Ethiopic, Slavic, Armenian and Georgian vernaculars, as well as Romance and Germanic, are treated in detail, along with the theme of allegorized spirituality and established forms of glossing. The chapters take the study of Bible history beyond the cloisters of medieval monasteries and ecclesiastical schools to consider the influence of biblical texts on vernacular poetry, prose, drama, law and the visual arts of East and West""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Martin and Mark A. Nicholas gather emerging and leading voices in the study of Native American religion to reconsider the complex and often misunderstood history of Native peoples' engagement with Christianity and with Euro-American missionaries. Surveying mission encounters from contact through the mid-nineteenth century, the volume alters and enriches our understanding of both American Christianity and indigenous religion. The essays here explore a variety of postcontact identities, including indigenous Christians, ""mission friendly"" non-Christians, and ex-Christians, thereby exploring the shifting world of Native-white cultural and religious exchange. Rather than questioning the authenticity of Native Christian experiences, these scholars reveal how indigenous peoples negotiated change with regard to missions, missionaries, and Christianity. This collection challenges the pervasive stereotype of Native Americans as culturally static and ill-equipped to navigate the roiling currents associated with colonialism and missionization. - Publisher.

Talese|Language English|Pages 368","From the bestselling author of How the Irish Saved Civilization, this book is a fascinating look at how medieval thinkers created the origins of modern intellectual movements. After the long period of decline known as the Dark Ages, medieval Europe experienced a rebirth of scholarship, art, literature, philosophy, and science and began to develop a vision of Western society that remains at the heart of Western civilization today, from the entry of women into professions that had long been closed to them to the early investigations into alchemy that would form the basis of experimental science. On visits to the great cities of Europe -- monumental Rome; the intellectually explosive Paris of Peter Abelard and Thomas Aquinas; the hotbed of scientific study that was Oxford; and the incomparable Florence of Dante and Giotto -- acclaimed historian Thomas Cahill brilliantly captures the spirit of experimentation, the colorful pageantry, and the passionate pursuit of knowledge that built the foundations for the modern world. - Publisher.

Similarly in the Bible, David mourns his companion, Jonathan, whose ""love to me was wonderful, greater than the love of women."" These passages, along with other ambiguous erotic and sexual language found in the Gilgamesh epic and the biblical David story, have become the object of numerous and competing scholarly inquiries into the sexual nature of the heroes' relationships. Susan Ackerman's innovative work carefully examines the stories' sexual and homoerotic language and suggests that its ambiguity provides new ways of understanding ideas of gender and sexuality in the ancient Near East and its literature.  In exploring the stories of Gilgamesh and Enkidu and David and Jonathan, Ackerman cautions against applying modern conceptions of homosexuality to these relationships. Drawing on historical and literary criticism, Ackerman's close readings analyze the stories of David and Gilgamesh in light of contemporary definitions of sexual relationships and gender roles. She argues that these male relationships cannot be taken as same-sex partnerships in the modern sense, but reflect the ancient understanding of gender roles, whether in same- or opposite-sex relationships, as defined as either active (male) or passive (female). Her interpretation also considers the heroes' erotic and sexual interactions with members of the opposite sex.  Ackerman shows that the texts' language and erotic imagery suggest more than just an intense male bonding. She argues that, though ambiguous, the erotic imagery and language have a critical function in the texts and serve the political, religious, and aesthetic aims of the narrators. More precisely, the erotic language in the story of David seeks to feminize Jonathan and thus invalidate his claim to Israel's throne in favor of David. In the case of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, whose egalitarian relationship is paradoxically described using the hierarchically dependent language of sexual relationships, the ambiguous erotic language reinforces their status as liminal figures and heroes in the epic tradition.

But in this bold and provocative book historian George Bernard examines it on its own terms, revealing a church with vibrant faith and great energy, but also with weaknesses that reforming bishops worked to overcome.Bernard emphasizes royal control over the church. He examines the challenges facing bishops and clergy, and assesses the depth of lay knowledge and understanding of the teachings of the church, highlighting the practice of pilgrimage. He reconsiders anti-clerical sentiment and the extent and significance of heresy. He shows that the Reformation was not inevitable: the late medieval church was much too full of vitality. But Bernard also argues that alongside that vitality, and often closely linked to it, were vulnerabilities that made the break with Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries possible. The result is a thought-provoking study of a church and society in transformation""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Is religion a product of blind evolutionary instinct or rational choice? Is it truly the best way to live a moral life? Ranging through biology, history, and psychology, Daniel C. Dennett charts religion's evolution from ""wild"" folk belief to ""domesticated"" dogma. Not an antireligious screed but an unblinking look beneath the veil of orthodoxy, Breaking the Spell will be read and debated by believers and skeptics alike.

"Beyond ""holy wars""",Christoffer H.

''Holy wars,'' rather, are a reality in today's world too, threatening global peace like never before. In this volume Christoffer Grundmann pleads for the cultivation of religious literacy and interreglious dialogue. First, he attempts to regain an adequate understanding of religion by showing the incompatibility of abstract concepts of religion with religions actually lived. So Grundmann suggests perceiving religion as the lived relationship toward an Ultimate. Given that interreligious dialogue is communication about diverse ways of relating to the Ultimate, the religiously embedded, primarily Jewish philosophy of encounter and dialogical thinking--with its personalistic nature--comes into focus here as uniquely suited for such communication. Even though interreligious encounter implies risk, Christians cannot but engage in it fearlessly, says Grundmann, because they trust that the risen Christ will reveal himself anew as the one he really is, wherever and whenever Christians take part in dialogue with people of other faiths. --Provided by publisher.

Some have cited a perception that began to grow after September 11: that faith in general is a source of aggression, intolerance and divisiveness--something bad for society. But how accurate is that view? And does it apply equally to all faiths? In these troubled times, we risk basing decisions of real and dangerous consequence on mistaken understandings of the faiths subscribed around us, in our immediate community as well as globally. And so, with her deep learning and sympathetic understanding, Karen Armstrong examines the impulse toward violence in each of the world's great religions.--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Youth Ministry,Malan Nel,religion,First published in 2018,/works/OL20927959W,/authors/OL1891713A/Malan_Nel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 442,"This book aims at contributing to the scientific and academic discourse as regards to the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of youth ministry. Too often, youth ministry has been approached from a mainly practical point of view, almost asking how we keep young people off the streets. Its methodology has often not included the theological and theoretical presuppositions that lie behind this ministry. Previous scientific reflection has been determined by a one-dimensional and almost exclusive point of view. In comparison with existing literature, this book does not focus so much on the ‘how’ of youth ministry. It innovates a different approach. The book challenges the existing exclusive approach and develops an inclusive, congregational and missional understanding of and approach to youth ministry.From a particular perspective on the understanding the main objectives of Practical Theology, the author endorses the so-called movement of ‘what is supposed to be going on’. He adds the outcome of an empirical round table discussion with some 16 leaders in this field on the descriptive and interpretive movements within the subject field: what is going on and why is it going on? The book will form the standard for any new research with regard to youth ministry. The book’s contribution lies on the level of sound theological reasoning and argumentation (supported by many scholars) for an inclusive congregational understanding of ministry as an integral part of every congregation being missional in being and doing. Youth, children, adolescents and emerging adults, are just as integral a part of every congregation within which they live and serve.

But then he goes beyond that, and mines the plays themselves, not just for the words of the characters, but for the concepts, themes and languages which Shakespeare was himself steeped in--the language of the Bible and The Book of Common Prayer. Considering such plays as Richard II, Henry V, The merchant of Venice, Measure for measure, Hamlet, Othello, The tempest and The winter's tale, Holderness shows how the ideas of Catholicism come up against those of Luther and Calvin; how Christianity was woven deep into Shakespeare's psyche, and how he brought it again and again to his art.

Part One explores introductory questions such as: what have been the historical and social factors fostering a black theology, and what are some of the internal factors key to its growth? Part Two examines major doctrines which have been important for black theology in terms of clarifying key intellectual foci common to the study of religion. The final part discusses black theology as a world-wide development constituted by interdisciplinary approaches. The volume has an important role in bringing Christian thought into confrontation with one of the central challenges of modernity, namely the problem of race and racism.

The director Mr. Reni Sentana-Ries formulated questions pertaining to all aspects of life, however the answers to these roughly 150 questions came unfiltered and verbatim from the One source of all intelligence: our evolved ancestors of the past and of the future.    When in 1995 the questions were formulated, they were drafted up in such a manner as to aim for authentic answers to widely held religious and philosophical beliefs, some of which are being viewed and accepted as hard core facts of life, yet lack the foundation of universal reality. This volume is meant to once and forever dispel the myths of man's belief systems inasmuch as they stand in isolation from all that is reality and truth in its purest known-to-man format.    As ever, the purpose for presenting truth in purity is to liberate the human spirit from long-held misconceptions, and we know that for a conscientious seeker of universe-reality this volume will set his or her spirit free, and pave the way for true enlightenment.    We therefore make no apology for knocking at the foundation of error irrespective of the extent to which its lies have permeated the human psyche. - The Editor   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

David O. McKay and the rise of modern Mormonism,Gregory A.

McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism is an insightful and detailed account of the exemplary life and remarkable influence of the 1st 'modern' Mormon prophet, David Oman McKay. Significantly enhanced by access to the private journals, office records and prolific correspondences kept by President McKay's long-time secretary, Claire Middlemiss; this book is a more intimate and personalized account than has previously been published of the transformational years from the early 1900's when McKay was first called as one of the twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through his long tenure as President of the Church from 1951 to 1970.  The authors have organized the book chronologically, but by individual subject matter; choosing to recount chapter by chapter President McKay's remarkable influence from beginning to end on each of a number of fascinating segments of the Latter-day Saint story. These segments include Agency and Tolerance, Blacks and the Priesthood, Ecumenical Outreach, Radio and Television Broadcasting, Correlation and Church Administration, the Education System, the Building Program, the Missionary Program, Temple Building, Confrontation with Communism, Politics and the Church and the International Church. Each chapter returns back to the young apostle and proceeds through the years to President's McKay's modernizing legacy as Prophet, Seer and Revelator for the Church that he loved and that he faithfully witnessed to be the literal restoration of the pure and authorized gospel of Jesus Christ on the earth.  Controversial in some points because of its candor regarding differences in political and doctrinal opinion between the leading brethren of the church, the book still radiates a sense of faith and devotion notwithstanding the human frailties of even the best of men in the most sacred of positions. Just as the New Testament reflects the reality of individual conflicts between Peter, Paul, James and others; so Latter-day Saints should not be offended by the open recognition that the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles was and is made up of strong, intelligent, opinionated men who are vigorous in promoting their personal perspectives, but sincerely strive for divine inspiration and unity in their service to the Lord and to His Church. In that respect, this book should give members of the Church a sense of deep gratitude for the remarkable camaraderie and unity displayed by the intellectually, politically and professionally diverse leadership of the LDS Church over the past decade under the leadership of Presidents Gordon B. Hinckley and Thomas S. Monson.  A remarkable read, and an important resource for anyone seeking to understand the ongoing emergence of the LDS Church from relative obscurity into the increasing glare of worldwide religious, political, humanitarian and economic prominence.

Nutt|Language English|Pages 138,"The book called 'The Consolation of Philosophy' was throughout the Middle Ages, and down to the beginnings of the modern epoch in the sixteenth century, the scholar's familiar companion. Few books have exercised a wider influence in their time. It has been translated into every European tongue, and into English nearly a dozen times, from King Alfred's paraphrase to the translations of Lord Preston, Causton, Ridpath, and Duncan, in the eighteenth century. The belief that what once pleased so widely must still have some charm is my excuse for attempting the present translation. The great work of Boethius, with its alternate prose and verse, skilfully fitted together like dialogue and chorus in a Greek play, is unique in literature, and has a pathetic interest from the time and circumstances of its composition. It ought not to be forgotten.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

That's the question that sparked a fascinating and, at times, terrifying journey into the heart of the Middle East during the summer of 2008. It was a trip that began in Egypt, passed beneath the steel and glass high rises of Saudi Arabia, then wound through the bullet- pocked alleyways of Beirut and dusty streets of Damascus, before ending at the cradle of the world's three major religions: Jerusalem.Tea with Hezbollah combines nail-biting narrative with the texture of rich historical background, as readers join novelist Ted Dekker and his co-author and Middle East expert, Carl Medearis, on a hair-raising journey. They are with them in every rocky cab ride, late-night border crossing, and back-room conversation as they sit down one-on-one with some of the most notorious leaders of the Arab world. These candid discussions with leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, with muftis, sheikhs, and ayatollahs, with Osama bin Laden's brothers, reveal these men to be real people with emotions, fears, and hopes of their own. Along the way, Dekker and Medearis discover surprising answers and even more surprising questions that they could not have anticipated--questions that lead straight to the heart of Middle Eastern conflict.Through powerful narrative Tea With Hezbollah will draw the West into a completely fresh understanding of those we call our enemies and the teaching that dares us to love them. A must read for all who see the looming threat rising in the Middle East.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Unending media coverage of extremist fanatics, the controversy over offensive cartoon depictions of Muhammad, and fatwas against journalists and authors are all hard to ignore and have prejudiced our Western perceptions of Muslims and their founder. This definitive biography of the founder of Islam by a leading Muslim-American scholar will reveal invaluable new insights, finally providing a fully three-dimensional portrait of Muhammad and the one billion people who follow him today.Memories of Muhammad presents Muhammad as a lens through which to view both the genesis of Islamic religion and the grand sweep of Islamic history—right up to the hot button issues of the day, such as the spread of Islam, holy wars, the status of women, the significance of Jerusalem, and current tensions with Jews, Hindus, and Christians. It also provides a rare glimpse into how Muslims spiritually connect to God through their Prophet, in the mosque, in the home, and even in cyberspace.This groundbreaking book offers the opportunity to move from telling Muhammad's story to talking about how different Muslims throughout Islamic history have both honored and contested Muhammad's legacy.

God's planet,Owen Gingerich,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL19992358W?edition=ia%3Agodsplanet0000ging,/authors/OL768596A/Owen_Gingerich,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27172471M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 170,"With exoplanets being discovered daily, Earth is still the only planet we know of that is home to creatures who seek a coherent explanation for the structure, origins, and fate of the universe, and of humanity's place within it. Today, science and religion are the two major cultural entities on our planet that share this goal of coherent understanding, though their interpretation of evidence differs dramatically. Many scientists look at the known universe and conclude we are here by chance. The renowned astronomer and historian of science Owen Gingerich looks at the same evidence - along with the fact that the universe is comprehensible to our minds - and sees it as proof for the planning and intentions of a Creator-God. He believes that the idea of a universe without God is an oxymoron, a self-contradiction. God's Planet exposes the fallacy in thinking that science and religion can be kept apart. Gingerich frames his argument around three questions: Was Copernicus right, in dethroning Earth from its place at the center of the universe? Was Darwin right, in placing humans securely in an evolving animal kingdom? And was Hoyle right, in identifying physical constants in nature that seem singularly tuned to allow the existence of intelligent life on planet Earth? Using these episodes from the history of science, Gingerich demonstrates that cultural attitudes, including religious or antireligious beliefs, play a significant role in what passes as scientific understanding. The more rigorous science becomes over time, the more clearly God's handiwork can be comprehended.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For millennia, religions have concocted numerous manifestations of heaven and the afterlife, the place where souls go after the death of the physical body. Religious leaders have toiled to make sense of this place that a surprising 74% of Americans believe exists, but from which no one has ever returned to report what it is really like.

In the face of what has persisted as a highly charged political issue over cow protection in India, intellectual space must be made to bring the wealth of Indian traditional ethical discourse to bear on the realities of current human-animal relationships, particularly those of humans with cows. Dharma, yoga, and bhakti paradigms serve as starting points for bringing Hindu—particularly Vaishnava Hindu—animal ethics into conversation with contemporary Western animal ethics. The author argues that a culture of bhakti—the inclusive, empathetic practice of spirituality centered in Krishna as the beloved cowherd of Vraja—can complement recently developed ethics-of-care thinking to create a solid basis for sustaining all kinds of cow care communities. ; Offers a focused insight into a key aspect of Hindu religious practice Integrates primary research and tertiary sources to give a multifaceted understanding of the intricacies of cow care practice Challenges conventional Western thought on cow care and its worldwide implications for animal ethics   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But it goes beyond these thinkers to argue that such a vision must be grounded metaphysically in a revitalized doctrine of Being. The result is a radically historicized natural-law ethics which argues that not only human individuals but human societies and indeed the universe as a whole grow and develop toward God. The fundamental moral law is to act in such a way as to promote this development. The author draws out the implications of this insight for our understanding of the virtues as well as for social justice.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The little-known Lamblove--tried and failed--to revolutionize contemporary Christian culture. As his journal entries, cereal box scribblings, and random notes written on paper scraps reveal, Lamblove sees contemporary culture as shallow, overly individualistic, and consumed with the kind of status measured by money, power, and celebrity. And American Evangelicalism--which has been integrated into the culture as a whole--has similar failings. Reverend Lamblove vanished without a trace, but Russell Rathbun has ""compiled"" his papers into a compelling critique of contemporary faith an antidote to faith-as-usual and a wakeup call for Christians to genuinely respond to the gospel.

Yours is the staggering responsibility and the matchless privilege of rallying believers and mobilizing their spiritual gifts in order to help people who are far from God become fully devoted followers of Christ. Life transformation and the eternal destinies of real people depend on the redemptive message entrusted to the local church. Are you willing to do whatever it takes to lead your church effectively so God's message of hope can change the world? Then this book is for you.  Courageous Leadership is Bill Hybels' magnum opus, a book far too important to be written before its time. Only now, after nearly thirty years leading his own church from a handful of people with a burning vision into a globe-spanning kingdom force---only after almost three decades of victories and setbacks, of praying hard and risking big---is Hybels ready at last to share the lessons he has learned, and continues to learn, about Christian leadership.  Too much is at stake for you not to maximize your spiritual gift of leadership, insists Hybels. In this passionate, powerful book, he unpacks the tools, tasks, and challenges of your calling. You'll discover the power of vision and how to turn it into action. You'll gain frontline insights for developing a kingdom dream team, discovering your leadership style, developing other leaders, making decisions, walking with God, embracing change, staying your God-given course, and much, much more. Drawing on his own richly varied life experiences, Hybels fleshes out vital principles with riveting firsthand stories.  This is far more than another book on leadership strategies and techniques. You'll find those topics in here, to be sure. But beyond them, you'll find the very essence of one of today's foremost Christian leaders---his fervent commitment to evangelism and discipleship and his zeal to inspire fellow church leaders even as he seeks to keep growing as a leader himself.  If unchurched people matter to you . . . if you love seeing believers serve passionately with their spiritual gifts . . . if God's heartbeat for the church is your heartbeat as well . . . then this book is a must. Courageous Leadership will convince you to lead with all your might, all your skill, and all your faith. And it will give you the tools to do just that.

Every church is driven by something. Tradition, finances, programs, personalities, events, seekers, and even buildings can each be the controlling force in a church. But Rick Warren believes that in order for a church to be healthy it must become a purpose-driven church, built around the five New Testament purposes given to the church by Jesus. ""The issue is church health, not church growth!"" declares Warren. ""If your church is healthy, growth will occur naturally. Healthy, consistent growth is the result of balancing the five biblical purposes of the church."" Rick Warren shares a proven five-part strategy that will enable your church to grow warmer through fellowship, deeper through discipleship, stronger through worship, broader through ministry, larger through evangelism. - Publisher.

The first part of their vision--warnings about World War II, communism, and the spread of atheism--were widely publicized, but Vatican officials were hesitant to reveal the vision's concluding images, thus creating the ""secret"" of Fatima. Speculation about this secret gripped many Catholics, and the aura of intrigue surrounding Fatima grew when the Church hierarchy barred the last surviving visionary from speaking publicly.In THE LAST SECRET OF FATIMA, Cardinal Bertone, the Vatican equivalent of prime minister and a top advisor to Pope Benedict, breaks the Vatican's official silence on the last secret. Rather than Armageddon, he claims, the final prophecy envisaged the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II. Bertone argues the apparition at Fatima was a call to renewal for the Church, and he was assigned the task of promulgating this message by the Pope.

""This controversial and important book rethinks the origins and meaning of Christianity,"" reported PW.    Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.  From Library Journal    Sheehan, professor of philosophy at Loyola, argues that Jesus dispensed with literal gods and formal religions, preaching a Kingdom of God within. He did not regard himself as divine but was made Savior and Son of God by the church. To recover His Kingdom, we must realize that ""God has disappeared into justice and mercy""; ours is ""the worldly task of human liberation."" Sheehan follows an argument long present in liberal theology, though one new wrinkle is his emphasis on Simon Peter's role in the misinterpretation of Jesus. Those interested in the ongoing efforts to reinterpret Jesus for the 20th century will want to read this scholarly book. Recommended for large public and academic libraries.

During the 5th through 9th centuries, Frankish society transformed from a relatively primitive tribal structure to a more complex hierarchical organization. Suzanne Fonay Wemple sets out to understand the forces at work in expanding and limiting women's sphere of activity and influence during this time. Her goal is to explain the gap between the ideals and laws on one hand and the social reality on the other. What effect did the administrative structures and social stratification in Merovingian society have on equality between the sexes? Did the emergence of the nuclear family and enforcement of monogamy in the Carolingian era enhance or erode the power and status of women?  Wemple examines a wealth of primary sources, such deeds, testaments, formulae, genealogy, ecclesiastical and secular court records, letters, treatises, and poems in order to reveal the enduring German, Roman, and Christian cultural legacies in the Carolingian Empire. She attends to women in secular life and matters of law, economy, marriage, and inheritance, as well as chronicling the changes to women's experiences in religious life, from the waning influence of women in the Frankish church to the rise of female asceticism and monasticism.

Jacob Neusner contradicts the prevailing view that following Christianity's ascendancy, Judaism continued to evolve in isolation. He argues that because of the political need to defend its claims to religious authenticity, Judaism was forced to review itself in the context of a triumphant Christianity. The definition of issues long discussed in Judaism—the meaning of history, the coming of the Messiah, and the political identity of Israel—became of immediate and urgent concern to both parties. What emerged was a polemical dialogue between Christian and Jewish teachers that was unprecedented.In a close analysis of texts by the Christian theologians Eusebius, Aphrahat, and Chrysostom on one hand, and of the central Jewish works the Talmud of the Land of Israel, the Genesis Rabbah, and the Leviticus Rabbah on the other, Neusner finds that both religious groups turned to the same corpus of Hebrew scripture to examine the same fundamental issues. Eusebius and Genesis Rabbah both address the issue of history, Chrysostom and the Talmud the issue of the Messiah, and Aphrahat and Leviticus Rabbah the issue of Israel. As Neusner demonstrates, the conclusions drawn shaped the dialogue between the two religions for the rest of their shared history in the West.

Doctrine and Race,Mary Beth Swetnam Mathews,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL17782129W,/authors/OL3079785A/Mary_Beth_Swetnam_Mathews,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26371629M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  University of Alabama Press|Language English,"By presenting African American Protestantism in the context of white Protestant fundamentalism, Doctrine and Race: African American Evangelicals and Fundamentalism between the Wars demonstrates that African American Protestants were acutely aware of the manner in which white Christianity operated and how they could use that knowledge to justify social change. Mary Beth Swetnam Mathews's study scrutinizes how white fundamentalists wrote blacks out of their definition of fundamentalism and how blacks constructed a definition of Christianity that had, at its core, an intrinsic belief in racial equality. In doing so, this volume challenges the prevailing scholarly argument that fundamentalism was either a doctrinal debate or an antimodernist force. Instead, it was a constantly shifting set of priorities for different groups at different times. A number of African American theologians and clergy identified with many of the doctrinal tenets of the fundamentalism of their white counterparts, but African Americans were excluded from full fellowship with the fundamentalists because of their race. Moreover, these scholars and pastors did not limit themselves to traditional evangelical doctrine but embraced progressive theological concepts, such as the Social Gospel, to help them achieve racial equality. Nonetheless, they identified other forward-looking theological views, such as modernism, as threats to ""true"" Christianity. Mathews demonstrates that, although traditional portraits of ""the black church"" have provided the illusion of a singular unified organization, black evangelical leaders debated passionately among themselves as they sought to preserve select aspects of the culture around them while rejecting others. The picture that emerges from this research creates a richer, more profound understanding of African American denominations as they struggled to contend with a white American society that saw them as inferior. Doctrine and Race melds American religious history and race studies in innovative and compelling ways, highlighting the remarkable and rich complexity that attended to the development of African American Protestant movements. - Publisher.

We struggle so much, work so hard, and fail so often that we frequently sense something in the equation of life must be missing. Tullian Tchividjian argues that what we are missing is the gospel -- a fuller, more powerful understanding of Jesus and what his finished work means for everyday life. During a year of great turmoil, Pastor Tchividjian discovered the power of the gospel in his own life. Sharing his story of how Jesus became more real to him, Tchividjian delves deeply into the fundamentals of the faith, explaining the implications of Christ's sufficiency -- a revelation that sets us free and keeps us anchored through life's storms. Ultimately, Tchividjian reminds us that Jesus is the whole of the equation as he boldly proclaims that Jesus plus nothing really is everything. - Publisher.

It is widely supposed – by seekers whose contemplative journeys have taken them to the East – that the “love of God” is alone the primary obligation and the highest goal in a Christian’s spiritual life, leaving no scope for contemplation as an integral part of this spiritual life. Not of this World invites the reader to explore a deeper and often overlooked dimension of Christian mysticism in which the accent is placed on the acquisition of gnosis (knowledge) and in which theosis (deification) is presented as the goal of the spiritual journey.Not of this World is a collection of short meditations on the contemplative life, drawn from a wide variety of Christian sources that range from the second to the twentieth centuries. Guided by writers whose backgrounds and experiences cross all sectarian divisions, the reader is invited to take part in a journey that follows the three classic stages of Purification, Illumination, and Union.Not of this World is unlike any previously published anthology of Christian mysticism by combining (1) primary sources drawn from nearly two thousand years of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant sources with (2) a focus on the acquisition of spiritual knowledge and “deification” as explicit goals of the Christian spiritual path. It is also unique as a book that can be as much at home on someone’s bedside table, providing inspiration, as it can be within the classroom as a valuable teaching tool.

Contributions from internationally recognized spiritual leaders and scholars include Bishop Kallistos Ware, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Huston Smith, James Cutsinger, William Chittick, John Chryssavgis, Gray Henry, Andrew Louth, and Reza Shah-Kazemi.Despite the long and well-known history of conflict between Christians and Muslims, their mystical traditions especially in the Christian East and in Sufism, have shared for centuries many of the same spiritual methods and goals. One thinks, for example, of the profound similarities between the practices of the Jesus Prayer among the Hesychast masters of the Philokalia and the Sufi practices of dhikr or invocation.These commonalities suggest the possibility for a deeper kind of religious dialogue than is customary in our day, a dialogue which seeks to foster what Frithjof Schuon has called inward or ""esoteric"" ecumenism, and which, while respecting the integrity of traditional dogmas and rites, ""calls into play the wisdom which can discern the one sole Truth under the veil of different forms.""The purpose of this book, the first major publication of its kind, is to promote precisely this more inward kind of ecumenical perspective. Contributors include some of the world's leading authorities on Christian and Muslim spirituality, including Bishop Kallistos Ware, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Huston Smith, James Cutsinger, Reverend John Chryssavgis, William Chittick and Reza Shah-Kazemi. Their essays point to a spiritual heart in which the deeper meaning of Christian and Muslim beliefs and practices come alive, and where spiritual pilgrims may discover, beyond the level of seemingly contradictory forms, an inner commonality with those who follow other paths..

Sure, you might snicker. And yet we often fall back on the perception that God only spoke to huge men of faith as recorded in the Bible – totally overlooking the fact that God continues to speak to us through His Word , the Scripture. These are His words to us, His promises to guide, comfort, minister and bring peace to humanity.These unique entries—one for each day of the year—are based upon scripture as conversational affirmations from God, with prayers of response for the reader, and with room for personal journaling.Have you ever wished you had a friend you could talk to about anything? Someone who would listen to your deepest secrets, thoughts, and feelings?When God Speaks to My Heart, is more than just a book, it’s a journey of discovery into a relationship with God, revealing that He is both sovereign and awesome and still yet the best Friend anyone could ever hope to have.

Happiness Is an Inside Job,"Sylvia, Ph.D. Boorstein",religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL9804837W,/authors/OL3790115A/Sylvia_Ph.D._Boorstein,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11970802M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 4, 2007|Publisher  Blackstone Audio, Inc.|Language English","How can we stay engaged with life day after day? How can we continue to love--to keep our minds in a happy mood--when life is complex, difficult, and, often, disappointing? Bestselling author and beloved teacher Sylvia Boorstein asked herself these questions when she started to write this inspiring new book. The result is her best work to date, offering warm, wise, and helpful ways we can experience happiness even when the odds are against us.As Boorstein has discovered in more than three decades of practice as a professional psychotherapist, the secret to happiness lies in actively cultivating our capacity to connect with kindness: with ourselves; with friends, family, colleagues; with those we may not know well; and even with those we may not like. She draws from the heart of Buddhist teachings to show how Wise Effort, Wise Mindfulness, and Wise Concentration can lead us away from anger, anxiety, and confusion, and into calmness, clarity, and the joy of living in the present. These qualities strengthen our ability to meet encounters of every kind with balance and intelligence, providing us with a grounded sense of true contentment.Happiness Is an Inside Job resonates with the knowledge of a psychotherapist, the compassion of a spiritual teacher, and the wisdom of a grandmother. Boorstein's vivid stories capture our minds and our hearts, and the simple exercises she suggests can be done while you read.This beautiful book is comforting and reminds us that life is a shared journey, that our hearts truly do want to console and love our fellow sojourners, and that living happily is indeed the best way to live.From the Hardcover edition.

But the membership of the Churches are not prepared to enter upon this work. Multitudes know nothing of a personal Pentecost. Many are utterly indifferent. They do not realize their opportunity and responsibility before God. If they did, the revival would come at once.With the hope that many professing Christians may be awakened to duty, and hear God's call to personal work in soul-winning, this little volume is written.Let the pastor see that a copy is put into every home one month previous to the time set for special revival-meetings. Let him secure a pledge from the people to read the study for each day, commit the memory verses, and meditate upon the Scripture suggested.Once each week, either at a special meeting appointed for this purpose, at the week-night prayer-meeting, or at the young people's devotional meeting Sunday evening, let the studies for the week be reviewed and the memory verses recited. Short talks may also be given on each topic by persons previously selected.When the entire Church membership shall begin to think and speak upon these vital themes; when the spirit of grace and supplication shall take the place of formality and worldly desire; when the Holy Ghost of Pentecost shall come upon the waiting, praying Church, then the times of refreshing will be sure to come from the presence of the Lord, and the perishing multitudes will be saved.

John and Stasi Eldredge have contributed the quintessential works on Christian spirituality through the experience of men and the experience of women and now they turn their focus to the incredible dynamic between those two forces.  With refreshing openness that will grab readers from the first page, the Eldredges candidly discuss their own marriage and the insights they've gained from the challenges they faced. Each talks independently to the reader about what they've learned, giving their guidance personal immediacy and a balance between the male and female perspectives that has been absent from all previous books on this topic.   They begin LOVE & WAR with an obvious but necessary acknowledgement:  Marriage is fabulously hard.  They advise that the sooner we get the shame and confusion off our backs, the sooner we'll find our way through.  LOVE & WAR shows couples how to fight for their love and happiness, calling men and women to step into the great adventure God has waiting for them together. Walking alongside John and Stasi Eldredge, every couple can discover how their individual journeys are growing into a story of meaning much greater than anything they could do or be on their own.From the Hardcover edition.
