Tags darauf setzt er seinem Leben ein Ende. Acht Jahrzehnte später nimmt Marica Bodrožić den letzten Weg des großen deutschen Schriftstellers und Philosophen zum Anlass, um über unsere Zeit, die Komplexität von Lebensläufen und Identität, Freundschaft und Flucht nachzudenken. Für sie wird der Gang über die Pyrenäen zu einem luziden Denkweg, auf dem die Natur als synästhetisches Gefüge mitspricht. Die äußere Bergwelt verschmilzt mit der inneren Lebenslandschaft. Kunstvoll webt Marica Bodrožić in ihren Gedankenstrom die Schicksale auch anderer Intellektueller ein, die der Gewalt des 20. Jahrhunderts ausgesetzt waren - etwa der Widerstandskämpferin Lisa Fittko oder des Dichters Ossip Mandelstam. Entstanden ist dabei eine überzeitliche Wanderung durch die inneren Landschaften der Seele, die das schmerzverzahnte Gedächtnis mit dem leuchtenden Kern von Poesie verbindet.

M. Forster's Maurice, Patricia Nell Warren's The Front Runner, Robertson Davies's Fifth Business, and Hallman's own memoir August Farewell.  Some of the stories focus specifically on the literary work. In others, the role of the book in the plot is quite subtle. The stories are emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating with some being sexually explicit.

This collection of stories from top harlequin authors reveals how it is sometimes better to see things with your heart.  If Love Be Blind by Emma Goldrick  She didn't intend to deceive him  When Philomena Peabody met her boss's son, he was suffering temporary snow blindness. ""You sound like somebody's mother;"" Penn Wilderman said, convinced by her no-nonsense attitude that she was ""a sweet little old lady.""  Even after she'd moved into his luxurious mansion to help look after his son, Phil couldn't disillusion Penn about her age.  To help win a custody battle for his teenage son, Phil agreed to marry Penn. But she dreaded facing him once the bandages were off, and he could see his attractive twenty-seven-year-old wife....  When I See Your Face by Connie Bennett  She wanted him desperately. . .  But there were numerous reasons mystery writer Ryanne Kirkland couldn't consider a future with Hugh MacKenna, the charismatic private investigator from Los Angeles.  Firstly, she was blind. And she didn't want any man's pity. More importantly, she had lost her sight after witnessing a brutal murder. There was a chance she'd regain her vision, but that meant identifying the murderer - and entering a witness protection program. Ryanne cared for Hugh too much to take him away from everything he held dear.  He only wished he could make her understand that none of it meant anything without her...  Blind to Love by Rebecca Winters  ""I'm not the man you married.""  But to Libby, her husband was the same, despite the accident that had left him blind. He was still the Vance Anson who'd created a successful mining empire in Kenya, still the loving husband whose kisses promised such rapture.  How could Libby fight Vance's insistence that his blindness changed everything? He no longer wanted Libby in his life--had even handed her an airline ticket home to England.  But Libby was determined to stay with her husband. She loved him too much to leave...   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|2 Currently reading|6 Have read

Thief of lives: stories,Kit Reed,short_stories,First published in 1992,/works/OL14920113W?edition=ia%3Athiefoflivesstor00reed,/authors/OL22255A/Kit_Reed,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1718057M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1992|Publisher  University of Missouri Press|Language English|Pages 179,"From Publishers Weekly:    Reed is an accomplished short story writer and novelist (the pseudonymous Gone is her current, critically acclaimed, psychological thriller) who in these 15 stories shows an uncanny eye for domestic anguish. She's by no means a one-note writer, however; the stories are enormously varied in tone and approach, and even in degree of success. After serving as a submariner in WW II, a man is haunted for the rest of his life by the death of his brothers in arms; a former priest tries desperately to keep his marriage together; a lonely divorcee cares too much about her children to allow them to be treated lightly by someone she's just met; a group of borderline mental patients builds a snow dinosaur in competition for a deranged girl; an overwhelming mother's dashing self-image forces her to walk miles through the sand on a cut foot; a son runs his father to ground in a banal end-of-the-world cult. Reed understands them all, and renders their situations, and their sometimes surprising resolutions, in swift, observant prose, with note-perfect dialogue. Only when she attempts surrealism (The Protective Pessimist) or overly glib satire (Academic Novel) does she seem less than surefootedly involved, though she is never less than clever.

Throughout his life, Roy returns to that moment, gripped by its memory and the shadow it casts over his small-town boyhood, describing with poignant, mercurial wit his parents' woeful marriage and inevitable divorce, their kindnesses and weaknesses, the absurd and comic turning-points of his past. Finally, in Legend of a Suicide, Roy lays his father's ghost to rest. But not before he exacts a gruelling, exhilarating revenge. Revolving around a fatally misconceived adventure deep in the wilderness of Alaska, this is a remarkably tender story of survival and disillusioned love.

Asked by a great king to awaken the dulled intelligence of his three idle sons, the aging Sarma is said to have composed the great work as a series of entertaining and edifying fables narrated by a wide range of humans and animals, and together intended to provide the young princes with vital guidance for life. Since first leaving India before AD 570, the Pancatantra has been widely translated and has influenced a cast number of works in India, the Arab world and Europe, including the Arabian Nights, the Canterbury Tales and the Fables of La Fontaine. Enduring and profound, it is among the earliest and most popular of all books of fables.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that makes up a soldier's daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. Written with hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth, Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing.

Here are the dreams of misplaced waitresses, prostitutes and other working girls, the survival techniques of secretaries too smart to take orders. In the title story, a woman yearns to be like Jack Kerouac, but is held back by a litany of rules teaching her to be a submissive girl, a ""pansy."" The main character in ""Look at the Moon"" is bored to distraction by her receptionist job but is still half under the influence of a Catholic upbringing when she hooks up with a flamboyant stranger and goes on a life-altering road trip with her. In ""The Dove, "" a wealthy widow who was pressured by her family to marry a rich man spends her life fixated on an affair she had a week before her wedding. Women young and old, rich and poor, make soul-threatening sacrifices to adhere to societal or familial strictures. Love is passionately evoked here, as are the myths and illusions that sustain it. Sheehan uses narrative elements poetically: these kaleidoscopic stories subvert the linear notion of storytelling, creating momentum and effect instead through ellipses, layering and contrast. Jack Kerouac Is Pregnant is the impressive debut of a beguiling, assured writer.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A salesman re-examines his tenuous relationship with his sister after she is brutally attacked. A house painter plans a new life for his family as he plots his last bank robbery. A drifter gets a chance at love when he delivers news of a barfly's death to the man's estranged daughter. A dissatisfied yuppie is oddly envious of his ex-con brother as they celebrate their first Christmas together. Set in a Los Angeles depicted with aching clarity, Lange's stories are gritty, and his characters often less than perfect. Beneath their macho bravado, however, they are full of heart and heartbreak.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Courage and achievement are celebrated and questioned, paradoxes examined, and human frailty appreciated in fifteen tales, at once lyrical and provocative, ranging fromthe fantastic to the achingly real.

Henry Memorial Awards.  Established in 1919 as a tribute to the memory of William Sydney Porter — America's beloved O. Henry — the awards have developed into the most important annual short-story series in America. The editors and judges, all of them distinguished men and women of letters, have chosen from the work of American writers appearing in Ameri- can publications. In their search for stories of exceptional merit they read all the magazines that publish fiction. Inclusion in one of the annual collec- tions means not only that a story has been chosen from hundreds of entries but also that it has passed through many readings. And to be chosen Number One is an honor indeed.  Among the writers who have won the first prize in past years are four Pulitzer Prize winners: Stephen Vincent Benét, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Roark Bradford, and James Gould Cozzens. Another, William Faulkner, has re- ceived the Nobel prize. Other notables represented in the collection are Flan- nery O'Connor, Irvin S. Cobb, Walter Duranty, Wilbur Daniel Steele, Wallace Stegner, Kay Boyle, Eudora Welty, Tru• man Capote, Irwin Shaw, and Katherine Anne Porter.  Besides serving as a springboard for new and talented writers, the series has been a mirror of our times. The annual editions have reflected the days of two world wars, women's suffrage, the vio- lence of the Roaring Twenties, Prohi- bition, the Depression, and even the vogue of Freudian psychology. Here, in a single volume, is a picture of Ameri- can life over a period of forty-six years. Even the change in the tone of the short story itself as a literary form—its shift from what people do to what they think —is apparent when one reads the stories in their chronological order.  And so FIRST-PRIZE STORIES offers not only reading enjoyment of an almost unequaled quality but an intriguing look at ourselves through the eyes of the most gifted writers of nearly five dec- ades. The late John Marquand called these stories ' 'documents of our time... reflecting the doubts, the suspense and the heartbreak of each year.""    --jacket   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hemmingson gently, sometimes aggressively, explores the sensual nature of trains, cars, art exhibits, and foreign countries. The women in these stories are strong, independent, and lurid -- working as strippers, writers, actresses, grad students, and filmmakers. In ""The Installation,"" a desperate young lass puts an ad in the paper: ""Female Will Do Anything for $10.000."" In ""Jolene,"" a man gets involved with a sassy strumpet he witnessed engaging in a juicy gang bang. In ""Natalie,"" a bold gal reveals her desire to be spanked, while ""Mo"" is a cautionary adventure about a sexy young college student who only performs oral sex with her partners. The need to connect, sexually and spiritually, with The Other is explored in ""The End of Celibacy"" and ""Feeling Something,"" while the title story examines the pros and cons of extramarital coitus.  Every story is eloquently written in perfect sentences, and explicitly rendered in Hemmingson's trademark fashion that has earned him a cult following in the literary erotica genre.

In ""Skylab,"" in which lovers have run away together to work medical relief in Malaysia, the young woman is reading the Koran to learn what it says about adulterers even as she waits for satellite debris to rain down on her. She'll be punished, won't she, for the crime of happiness? And in ""The Bride of the Black Duck"" a new widow falls in love with an entire complicated family in her neighborhood, with whom she's suddenly, irrevocably plighted her troth: she is theirs, just as they are hers.

At a deluxe medical spa on a nameless Caribbean island, a middle-aged woman hopes to revitalize her fading youth with grotesque rejuvenating therapies that combine cutting-edge medical technologies with holistic approaches and the pseudo-religious dogma of Zen-infused self-help. And in a rinky-dink mill town, an adolescent girl is unexpectedly inspired by the ravings and miraculous levitation of her fundamentalist friend's weird grandmother. These are only a few of the scenarios readers encounter in Julia Elliott's debut collection, The Wilds. In these genre-bending stories, teetering between the ridiculous and the sublime, Elliott's language-driven fiction uses outlandish tropes to capture poignant moments in her humble characters' lives. Without abandoning the tenets of classic storytelling, Elliott revels in lush lyricism, dark humor, and experimental play. ""--   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now, in her first story collection in decades, Lively takes up themes of history, family, and relationships across varied and vividly rendered settings. In the title story, a Mediterranean purple swamp hen chronicles the secrets and scandals of Quintus Pompeius's villa, culminating with his narrow escape from the lava and ash of Vesuvius. ""Abroad"" captures the low point of an artist couple's tumultuous European road trip, trapped in a remote Spanish farmhouse and forced to paint a family mural and pitch in with chores to pay for repairs to their broken-down car. Other stories reveal friends and lovers in fateful moments of indiscretion, discovery, and even retribution--as in ""The Third Wife,"" when a woman learns her husband is a serial con artist and turns a house-hunting trip into an elaborately staged revenge trap. Each of these delightful stories is elevated by Lively's signature graceful prose and eye for the subtle yet powerfully evocative detail. Wry, charming, and keenly insightful, The Purple Swamp Hen and Other Stories is a masterful achievement from one of our most beloved writers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And finally, Séverine and Benjamin understand that they have lost the love of their lives when they see themselves through the eyes of a young terminally ill girl. Love is not easy, and not always easy to find; at times, it is obliged to circumvent social norms, and thus transform them; it must be desired, sought, defended. We cannot know what life has in store for us, but we do know that whatever it is, it will only be meaningful if borne on the wings of love. Schmitt's sublime stories remind us how true this is.

Now, with this first collection of short fiction, her ""astonishing gift for creating characters that take up residence in readers' heads"" ( The Washington Post ) is showcased like never before. Throughout the ten stories in You Think It, I'll Say It, Sittenfeld upends assumptions about class, relationships, and gender roles in a nation that feels both adrift and viscerally divided. In ""The World Has Many Butterflies,"" married acquaintances play a strangely intimate game with devastating consequences. In ""Vox Clamantis in Deserto,"" a shy Ivy League student learns the truth about a classmate's seemingly enviable life. In ""A Regular Couple,"" a high-powered lawyer honeymooning with her husband is caught off guard by the appearance of the girl who tormented her in high school.

""Susan Sontag was one of our foremost public intellectuals, a world-renowned essayist, playwright, novelist, activist, and director. Her name is surpassed only by her immense and invaluable body of work. Debriefing collects all of Sontag's shorter fiction, a form she turned to intermittently throughout her writing life. The book's contents range from allegory to parable to autobiography, and show her wrestling with problems not typical of the essay, her more customary mode. Here she catches fragments of life on the fly, dramatizes her private griefs and fears, lets characters take her where they will. The result is a collection of remarkable brilliance, versatility, and charm. Sontag's work has typically required time for people to catch up to it. These challenging Works of literary art--made more urgent by the passage of years-await a new generation of readers. Debriefing is an invaluable record of the creative output of one of the most inquisitive and analytical thinkers of the twentieth century at the height of her power.""--Dust jacket flap.

Aplicó el rigor de la verdad contrastada frente a la mentira programada y torticera, a lo largo de siglos. En estos 6 relatos ejemplares 6 esclarece unos hechos muy concretos y fundamentales protagonizados por nobles, reyes, damas y señores, gentes del pueblo, en la Europa del siglo XVI. Intrahistorias dentro de la Historia narradas con un estilo preciso, ejemplar y ameno» (Laura Revuelta, ABC Cultural).  Con la venida del cisma luterano el orbe mediterráneo-católico asume de manera inconsciente el discurso de supremacía moral que impone el norte protestante. De este modo palabras como «libertad», «tolerancia», «ciencia» y «Reforma» quedan de un lado y en el otro, como una imagen especular en negativo «opresión», «intolerancia», «fanatismo» y, vaya por Dios, «Contrarreforma». Desde un principio se perdió la batalla más importante, la del lenguaje, y entre sus armas se contó con la propaganda, nuevo artefacto crucial para entender la civilización occidental en el último medio milenio.  Los seis relatos aquí reunidos tienen como trasfondo el mundo protestante en diversas épocas y lugares de Europa. La autora ha escogido seis momentos entre cientos posibles que sirven de contrapunto a esa visión monolítica impuesta desde el cisma y en la que el orbe mediterráneo quedó descrito —hasta la actualidad— como el Demonio del Mediodía. En ellos veremos desfilar personajes anónimos y nombres como Lutero, Ana de Sajonia, Calvino, Felipe Guillermo de Orange-Nassau, primogénito de Guillermo de Orange, o el mismo William Shakespeare.

Haunted, a collection of sixteen tales that range from classic ghost stories to portrayals of chilling psychological terror, raises the genre to the level of fine literature - complex, multi-layered, and gripping fiction that is very scary indeed.  In the title story, ""Haunted, "" the pubescent Melissa and her best friend, the sexually precocious Mary Lou, ignore ""no trespassing"" signs to explore forbidden houses. But the deserted Minton farm is one place where they should not have gone, and years later Melissa is tormented by her memories of its malevolence...and the murder of Mary Lou. In the novella, ""The Model, "" a sexual threat seems to underlie the interaction between young Sybil Blake and ""Mr. Starr, "" who asks her to be his model, but the truth about her own identity, and his, shows that the danger is lurking in a different part of the heart. The ""Accursed Inhabitants of the House of Bly, "" a macabre reworking of Henry James's ""The Turn of the Screw, "" resurrects the evil of Miss Jessel and Quint, who are up to their old tricks with the children, Miles and Flora, but with new, perverse, and brilliant revelations.  The tales in this collection plunge the reader into nightmare worlds where violence slips in unexpectedly, where reality turns into a funhouse mirror, and where American culture goes awry in shocking, provocative ways. Joyce Carol Oates is a master storyteller of the dark side. She writes with skillfully controlled prose, tightly woven plots, and deep psychological insight that m her fictional horror worthy to set alongside the stories of Edgar Allan Poe - and far above all the rest.  Haunted --    The doll --    The bingo master --    The white cat --    The model --    Extenuating circumstances --    Don't you trust me --    The guilty party --    The premonition --    Phase change --    Poor Bibi --    Thanksgiving --    Blind --    The radio astronomer --    Accursed inhabitants of the House of Bly --    Martyrdom   Read more Read less",16 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf|Language English,"From the writer whose first novel, Bright Lights, Big City, defined a generation and whose seventh and most recent, The Good Life, was an acclaimed national best seller, a collection of stories new and old that trace the arc of his career over nearly three decades. In fact, the short story, as A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times Book Review, shows ""McInerney in full command of his gifts . . . These stories, with their bold, clean characterizations, their emphatic ironies and their disciplined adherence to sound storytelling principles, reminded me of, well, Fitzgerald and also of Hemingway--of classic stories like 'Babylon Revisited' and 'The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.' They are models of the form.""Only seven of these stories have ever been collected in a book, but all twenty-six unveil and re-create the manic flux of our society. Whether set in New England, Los Angeles, New York or the South, they capture various stages of adulthood, from early to budding to entrenched to resentful: a young man confronting the class system at a summer resort; a young woman holed up in a remote cabin while her (married) boyfriend campaigns for the highest office of all; a couple whose experiments in sexuality cross every line imaginable; an actor visiting his wife in rehab; a doctor contending with both convicts and his own criminal past; a youthful socialite returning home to nurse her mother; an older one scheming for her next husband; a family celebrating the holidays while mired in loss year after year; even Russell and Corrine Calloway, whom we first met in McInerney's novel Brightness Falls.A manifold exploration of delusion, experience and transformation, these stories display a preeminent writer of our time at the very top of his form.From the Hardcover edition.

It's nearly identical to her mother's nearby--in the Copper Waters subdivision, they all are--but she likes it here, eating boiled eggs and watching TV, feeling out her freedom as heavy rains fall. And then a nearby dike fails. And the girl may be the only one left in Copper Waters. Eliza Robertson can handle the shocking turn, but she also has a knack for the slow surprise, the realization that settles around you like snow. Her stories are deftly constructed and their perspectives--often those of the loners and onlookers, distanced by their gifts of observation--are unexpected. In ""We Walked on Water,"" winner of the Commonwealth Short Story Prize, a brother and sister train together for a race that will ultimately separate them forever. In ""L'Etranger,"" shortlisted for the CBC Short Story Prize, a girl abroad in Marseille reconsiders her unendearing roommate after an intimate confrontation. Robertson was raised on rugged Vancouver Island. She's traveled broadly since, and her stories travel, too, but the climate of her collection is influenced by her home. These carefully cultivated forms still flare with wildness, and each is still spacious enough for a reader to get lost in wonder""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The voices speak of a plot to murder a wife who has failed to produce a child and whose family has failed to produce the promised dowry.Megha is sick with horror when she realizes she is the intended victim. Her husband--the very man who tied the sacred necklace of marriage around her neck—and his mother are plotting to kill her! In the moment of panic, she runs for her life. Frantically racing through Palgaum’s deserted streets, her way lit only by the lights strung up for the Diwali festival, her single goal is to escape death by fire. But fleeing from her would-be killers seems impossible--unless she can find someone to help her.To approach her best friend would bring scandal to an innocent woman's doorstep, and turning to her own strict, conservative family is out of the question. Instead, with nothing but the sari she wears and a memory of kindness, Megha finds her way to Kiran, the one man who has shown her friendship and respect. Hiding her in his apartment, Kiran becomes her protector. But the forbidden attraction that grows between them can only bring more danger.Caught between tradition and the truths buried in her heart, a dowry bride will discover the real cost of the only things worth having in life.

Modeled after Theophrastus' Characters - brief, verbal snapshots of people created by the Greek philosopher - Heynen captures not just the quirks and eccentricities of his characters, but also their humanity. Guilty of only ordinary and forgivable sins, these sketches reveal universal human idiosyncrasies as much as they do the individual characters. Paired with the wonderfully evocative illustrations of renowned illustrator Tom Pohrt, Ordinary Sins will appeal to story lovers and collectors of beautifully made books alike.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Barth's writing was not a response to the realistic fiction that characterized American literature at the time; it beckoned back to the founders of the novel: Cervantes, Rabelais, and Sterne, echoing their playfulness and reflecting the freedom inherent in the writing of fiction. This collection of Barth's short fiction is a landmark event, bringing all of his previous collections together in one volume for the first time. Its occasion helps readers assess a remarkable lifetime's work and represents an important chapter in the history of American literature. Dalkey Archive will reissue a number of Barth's novels over the next few years, permanently preserving his work for generations to come.

Praised by contemporaries including Ernest Hemingway and Dorothy Parker, he wrote about sex, drinking, and social class with a frankness ahead of its time. The fiction he published in The New Yorker (more than any other writer to this day) came to epitomize the kind of short story featured in that magazine, and his impeccable ear and skillful dialogue have influenced later writers such as Raymond Carver.

Cherise tries to impress a man who only exists in her imagination. Violet throws away a meaningful relationship with a vampire in favor of online community. Tabitha feels she can only be loved by the doll she carries around in her purse. Lara wants to marry a man who believes every lie she tells. And in the final story, Just the Right Kind of Stranger, Irene becomes so enamored with the idea of attracting violent predators that she becomes what she seeks out. Through stories that move between reality and mysticism, Burns carries a conversation about the pitfalls of a search for love and the feeling of isolation while surrounded by a world of multitudes. This collection also features a follow-up to Tiny Ron, the most popular story in Misfits and Other Heroes, published by Dzanc in 2009.

Comprised of short fiction selected over a 20-year period, ""The Deer Walking Upside Down"" invites readers into a world where hard work and an abiding respect for all things wild inform the lives of this rural paradise, yet not without a price. As men and women reconcile passion and inclination, love and the wreckage of aging, there is always work to be done: fences to be repaired, hives to be tended to, livestock to be fed, and loves to be fostered. Steeped in the tradition of Jim Harrison and Tom McGuane, this collection marks the arrival of a distinct voice in the contemporary Western literary landscape.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Young men in search of adventure ... explorers driven to investigate the ends of the earth ... a girl trying to find the perfect hiding place ... a curiosity-seeker drawn to an abandoned amusement park. All of them are looking for something--and unfortunately, they usually find it. For the very unlucky, it sometimes finds them! In these ten spellbinding stories by World Fantasy Award winner Barbara Roden, very little is as innocent as it seems; but much is haunting, enigmatic, and terrifying. Where the Twilight Zone ends, the Northwest Passages begin. Publishers Weekly has described the work of two-time World Fantasy Award winner Barbara Roden as 'eloquent' and 'a standout.' Her stories--many of them inspired by some of the world's less travelled corners--have appeared in a number of anthologies, including Year's best fantasy and horror. ... Northwest passages is her first collection""--Page [2-3] of jacket.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Eric was brought to the house, and Eric and Alice were married before there was time to say 'knife'. How did it happen? She tried to trace it back. She was watching her mother performing for Eric, and then (she always paused here in her mind), somehow, she woke up married and in another house."" Internationally acclaimed for her five brilliant novels, Elizabeth Harrower is also the author of a small body of short fiction. A Few Days in the Country brings together for the first time her stories published in Australian journals in the 1960s and 1970s, along with those from her archives - including 'Alice', published for the first time earlier this year in the New Yorker. Essential reading for Harrower fans, these finely turned pieces show a broader range than the novels, ranging from caustic satires to gentler explorations of friendship.

These are intense and private lives made public by the force of their individual voices, voices that may be rambunctious and fractious but that are, nonetheless, elegant in their intent and humor and their acceptance that is never acquiescence.

Coming of age, the impact of class, and familial and romantic love are the prevalent motifs, along with the instinct toward escape and subsequent nostalgia for home. Some of the stories are linked and some carry O'Brien's distinct sense of the comical. In ""A Rose in the Heart of New York,"" the single-mindedness of love dramatically derails the relationship between a girl and her mother, while in ""Sister Imelda"" and ""The Creature"" the strong ties between teacher and student and mother and son are ultimately broken. ""The Love Object"" recounts a passionate affair between the narrator and her older lover. The magnificent, mid-career title story from Lantern Slides portrays a Dublin dinner party that takes on the lives and loves of all the guests. More recent stories include ""Shovel Kings"" and ""Old Wounds,"" which follows the revival and demise of the friendship between two elderly cousins.

Many of these works have been out of print for more than a century, partly because they were written by women. Nathaniel Hawthorne called the authors ""a damned mob of scribbling women,"" who dared to expose what was in their hearts, as well as their heads. The 33 stories by 21 women writers included here focus on character rather than plot and lead us into parlors, kitchens, and shops where one notices the telling details of a worn but mended carpet, the meal set before an irritable husband, or the oil spilled from a tipped lamp. Powerful emotions, important ideas, and compelling dramas occurring behind the walls of ordinary houses— particularly the struggles of the Sioux, the Chinese, and African Americans as told by minority writers—appear in these tales first published a hundred or more years ago. These selections, along with unfamiliar stories by authors such as Kate Chopin and Edith Wharton, make Rediscoveries a valuable resource and an enriched and expanded vision of our literary history. Here are the missing voices of American literature.    --back cover   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By weaving together tales of interstellar war, an enchanted carnival, or a dating debacle, Unbroken celebrates the varied experiences of disabled teens, including teens of color and of diverse genders and orientations, without obscuring the realities of their disabilities.

It's hard to remember what semester we are supposed to be in. Several of the clocks still operate, but they don't show the same time. The red bells, affixed in every room, erupt several times each day, yet the intervals between the disruptions wax and wane with an unknown algorithm. The windows are obscured by construction paper murals. Consequently, the sun rises and falls in complete ignorance of those of us attending the school. Many of us participated in the decorations in some lost point of childhood. A few of us still have dried glue under our fingernails. In the room I sit in now, the windows are covered with a glitter and glue reenactment of the colonization of Roanoke by Sir Walter Raleigh. Outside of the window, who knows?Children go to school long after all the teachers have disappeared, a man manages an apartment complex of attempted suicides, and a couple navigates their relationship in the midst of a zombie attack. In these short stories, we are the upright beasts, doing battle with our darker, weirder impulses as the world collapses around us.Lincoln Michel's work has appeared in BOMB, Oxford American, Tin House, the Believer, The Paris Review Daily, and elsewhere. A founding editor of the literary magazine Gigantic, Michel also serves as an online editor for Electric Literature""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Among the best contributions is ""Baseball in July,"" in which Patrick Hoctel sensitively captures the fine tensions in a family when Paul brings his lover home. Lucas Dedrick's delicate and haunting ""The Beach"" focuses on a man who kidnaps his AIDS-afflicted lover from the stale-aired hospice for a few hours of sand and sun. In ""Flying Low,"" Tom McKague conjures a set of vivid characters--including an ironic English teacher and a confused young man named Angel Scarafino--with snappy prose and bracing humor. Louie Crew offers the most convincing, though still sentimental, coming-of-age story, ""Ben's Eyes,"" which follows a young boy's awakening to sensuality through his admiration of an older cousin in rural Georgia. Altogether less satisfying is Walter Rico Burrell's ""Rites of Passage,"" a melodramatic and gruesome portrait of a child who not only suffers his drunken father's anger but is molested by a neighboring reverend.

'Disappearances', inspired by local legends of mysterious vanishings, mixes gossip and fact; 'Lois the Witch', a novella based on an account of the Salem witch hunts, shows how sexual desire and jealousy lead to hysteria; while in 'The Old Nurse's Story' a mysterious child roams the freezing Northumberland moors. Whether darkly surreal, such as 'The Poor Clare', where an evil doppelganger is formed by a woman's bitter curse, or mischievous like 'Curious, if True', a playful reworking of fairy tales, all the stories in this volume form a stark contrast to the social realism of Gaskell's novels, revealing a darker and more unsettling style of writing.

A Regency Christmas I,Mary Balogh,short_stories,First published in 1989,/works/OL14920314W,/authors/OL22263A/Mary_Balogh,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7572916M-M.jpg,"Publish Date November 7, 1989|Publisher  Signet|Language English|Pages 347","Under the Kissing Bough by Sandra Heath    Mrs. Crayforth, housekeeper for Fairhill Park, was distraught when the Charlton family fell upon hard times and had to sell their home and move to a smaller house half a mile distant in Lyme Regis. As Christmas approaches, she is amazed to see Madeleine, the oldest Charlton daughter, fleeing from the house in obvious consternation leaving the new owner, Sir Philip Levington who arrived two days earlier than expected. Even more surprising was when Sir Philip had to seek the identity of the fleeing lady from Mrs. Crayforth. As the Christmas season progresses, and Sir Philip continues to spend time in Madeleine’s company, Mrs. Crayforth hopes for a happy ending for all. Then Sir Philip’s ex-fiance shows up.  Season of Joy by Gayle Buck    Miss Theresa Huntington does not understand war, especially why men like her twin brother, her best friend and neighbor, and her betrothed feel they must put themselves in danger of losing their lives by being part of it. To make things even more difficult, her betrothed, Sir Robert Houser, goes to war before they have an opportunity to straighten out a misunderstanding that arose when he saw the fond farewell she gave John Stanhope, her best friend and neighbor. While the reader sees Robert at his angriest, the relationship changes through correspondence over time.  The Viscount and the Hoyden by Laura Matthews    Alice Halliston Porchester (Hally) is dismayed when her younger brother suggests that Viscount Marchwood, their mother’s best friend’s son, was coming to visit in order to court Hally. How could any man be interested in a hoyden such as herself? Besides, since her mother’s death, she has stood in the role of running the house and taking care of the two younger children. She couldn’t possibly leave that, could she?  The Christmas Mouse by Emily Hendrickson    Amanda Barkly led a mousey existence in her older brother’s household, always doing what his wife asked, and serving as governess to four children, but without pay. One year, just before Christmas, she finds out that she has been named to take over the estate of her father’s good friend, making her quite a wealthy heiress. She immediately travels to her new home, and as she is taking her first tour of the house, she is startled by a mouse on the mantle. When she screams, her neighbor and the former estate manager, Charlie Dane, comes to help. Can she convince him that feelings are more important than sentiments?  No Room at the Inn by Mary Balogh    Two romances in one. When a group of travelers all get stranded at the far from memorable White Hart Inn, they pull together to help a young, penniless couple give birth to their son. In the process, they are reminded of the true meaning of the season leading to a reconciliation for Lord and Lady Birkin, and a new romance for Edward Riddings, Marquess of Lytton and Miss Pamela Wilder.

Lord Randolph is lonely and doesn't want to go to Christmas festivities with either friends or relatives. It has been raining for more than 30 days. He decides to go where there is sunshine at this time - Italy.  Unfortunately, when he arrives, it is raining in Naples too. Later, he gets involved in an Italian family tiff, through no fault of his own. A young spinster, Elizabeth Walker, saves Lord Randolph from the clutches of the unhappy family. When he finds that Elizabeth is between governess jobs, he hires her to be his guide.  THE LAST WISH - Anita Mills. Wealthy Uncle Jack is dying; it is the Christmas holidays. Gathered about are three cousins: George, Edwin and Drew. Of the three, Drew is the only solvent cousin; in fact, he is wealthier than his uncle. The other two are there for the money; each is afraid the other cousin will get the will changed just before Uncle Jack dies. Both of these cousins are seriously in debt due to their gambling.  The entire apple cart is overturned when Uncle Jack's granddaughter arrives. Jack and his son had a falling out and there was no communication between the men. Both of Rebecca Grey's parents are now dead and her Aunt Mia can no longer keep the child ... her employer insists.  PLAYING HOUSE - Mary Balogh. A deeply cynical and unhappy Marquess of Bedford has come back home after a 6 year absence. He has brought his young daughter, Dora; his wife is deceased (after abandoning her husband and their child for another man).  While bringing baskets of food for the poor, Lilias Angove and her young brother and younger sister meet Dora and have a great time. The Angove children invite Dora to go collecting boughs and mistletoe. Thus begins a lovely tale.  THE THREE KINGS - Carla Kelly. A young woman, Lady Sarah Comstock, is trying to leave Salamanca, Spain for the Spanish border. Her brother James was recently killed in a local library archives while copying long-lost documents related to Christopher Columbus.  A friend puts Sarah in the hands of a Spanish general, Colonel Sotomayor, to get to the border. Spain is at war with France and the French have overrun the country. The trip is dangerous and Sotomayor is seriously wounded.  THE CHRISTMAS STAR - Sheila Walsh. Louise Beresford, a poor relation to a duke and duchess, has been taken into their household. Louise quickly becomes indispensable to the family and staff. The duke's youngest daughter, Amelia, is about to have her 18th birthday party during the Christmas holiday season.  Russian Prince Andrei Zarcov, visiting in the neighborhood, soon is invited to Lady Amelia Revel's party. The duchess and Amelia immediately try to spend as much time with the prince as possible.

I would say the book goes well beyond Halloween. It can be dipped into at any time and the reader can frighten themselves and others with any of the thirty stories within. Although the presentation of the book is lighthearted, there is some quite weighty material within and the majority of the stories are written as direct experiences of peoples' inexplicable meetings with the weird and wonderful. Some of the more straightforward accounts stay in the mind long after reading, such as 'Lucy', the ghost of a neighbour's sister who follows the new house owner down the stairs and smiles at her, and 'The Little Chapel Wedding' where a young woman witnesses the wedding of her long-deceased grandparents in a small chapel in Wales. Some of these stories are multi-layered and thought-provoking. The 'Devil in My Bed' has a two-layered meaning to ponder on and 'Fritz' is an almost amusing account of a 'German soldier who loiters in the Officers' Mess, leaving the scent of perfume behind as his rather feminine trademark. The darker stuff - 'The House Next Door' for example - really leaves a shiver as the pale face of a man who killed his own family peers out at the curious neighbour. This collection is a mixture of ghostliness and mild horror for the whole family. It is a successful book in terms of variety and content, and as part of the proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Breast Cancer Campaign, it is well worth investing in for future Halloween reading and for those long dark winter nights.

Fourteen-year-old Loren is obsessed with all things military: Special Forces, secret missions, rules, and regulations—it’s all so finite and orderly. Especially compared to other parts of Loren’s life. His mom, for example, keeps introducing him to a string of loser boyfriends, and the latest one, the golf pro, is so irritating that Loren decides to stage a night raid and vandalize his beloved golf course. When the mission goes embarrassingly awry, Loren’s mom sends him to Camp Ascend!, where a dedicated staff of specialists are trained to whip “mixed-up” teens back into shape. Or so it seems. What Loren’s mom doesn’t know—and what Loren soon discovers—is that Camp Ascend! is actually a scam run by an ex-con nicknamed “the Colonel,” his ditzy, overly tanned wife, and her manic, kid-hating brother. And so Loren finally has a real-life mission: to free himself and his new posse of delinquent friends from Camp Ascend! and to take the place down. About the Author Jeff Garigliano is a magazine editor living in New York City. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served as an officer in the navy for five years before getting a master’s degree in journalism from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dogface is his first novel.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At a party to kick off the twenty-first century, Frank Reichert meets Julia, his lost love. Since their separation in the fall of 1989, he's drifted through life like an exile, remaining apathetic toward the copy-shop business he started even as it flourishes apace. Nothing has the power to move him now: his whole life lies under the shadow of Julia, of the idea that things could have worked out differently. But as night draws on to day, the promised end becomes an unexpected new beginning.Ingo Schulze introduces us to characters as they stray outside the confines of East Germany into other, newer lives--into Egypt, where the betrayal of a lover turns an innocent vacation into a nightmare; into Vienna, where life starts to mimic art; into Estonia, where we meet a retired circus bear in an absurd (and absurdly hilarious) dilemma--or as they simply stay put, struggling to maintain their sense of themselves as the world around them changes.Mixed in with these tragicomic tales are some of the most beautiful love stories ever to feature cell phones. And throughout, Schulze's masterfully controlled style conceals an understated, but finally breathtaking, intricacy.From the Hardcover edition.

El autor –que tras su retiro participo en talleres de cuentos de Erick Pohlammer, quien de paso prologa la seleccion, Marta Blanco y Amalia Andaur- no solo tiene la creatividad para pasearse por una variopinta gama de temas, sino que tambien un sentido de la concision y la precision que hacen que cada cuento tenga la extension justa, sin que sobren palabras, sermones, moralejas o admoniciones.Concha se escapa al estilo de otros escritores vinamarinos de su generacion. Hay fluidez en su prosa y una frescura que le otorga un caracter bastante mas juvenil. Hay tambien, esperanza o aceptacion en estos frescos de personajes sumamente humanos y no siempre felices –como el de aquella duena de casa que se pierde en una noche de copas y coqueteria jugando a ser lo que nunca se atrevio o el hombre de negocios que tras el terremoto de 1906, adivina que no solo ha perdido su bella casa, sino tambien a su bella esposa quien es acogida en su hogar por un gentil boticario-. Como si estuviese pintando con una paleta repleta de colores, Concha se pasea por multiples matices, epocas, historias, voces y hechos.        Asi, tenemos cuentos terribles y bien estructurados como ""El ultimo viaje"", donde una mujer mantiene el sentido de oido, el dolor y la conciencia mientras baja en su ataud hacia el crematorio; junto a otros casi infantiles como el bello ""EL espantapajaros del rey"", una fabula bastante bien narrada donde no faltan elementos de suspenso y tension.        Para los portenos y ex portenos, es un placer pasearse por los espacios que van surgiendo en algunos de los relatos; para quienes gozaron de la infancia en el campo, la sensualidad ingenua de esos ""Orgasmos de colores"" que una jovencita experimenta a los 14 anos, tras los cuales viene el aborto programado por mama y el internado de monjas.        En suma, una coleccion de elementos vistos con historias recien estrenadas.        A destacar, la prosa limpia y dinamica del autor y su habilidad para meterse en el pellejo de hombres y mujeres, vejetes y adolescentes, seres miticos y tipos comunes y corrientes.        Quiza si hay algo que echar de menos es la posibilidad de escarbar mas a fondo en la psicologia de algunos personajes, el buceo en profundidad que incluso el cuento mas corto permite, lo que implica que no es un asunto de caracteres mas o caracteres menos-a veces en una sola frase, a veces en la perspectiva emocional con que se enfoca la historia, como sucede en ese bonito cuento que es ""ICARO Enamorado""Comentario de Ximena Ceardi en Revista ""Vivir Mejor"" (GasValpo) Diciembre 2004.

Taylor and Thompson realized they had something to offer that wasn't available in treatment centers or therapies groups—a workshop in which people affected by cancer write and perform monologues about their cancer stories. The stories that surface are honest and intimate. These monologues are about reawakened desire, dreams of flight and finding humor in the most unlikely places. Like letters from the frontlines, they capture the glory and darkness of life."" About the Editors Tanya Taylor studied theater at Carnegie-Mellon University and HB acting studios in New York City. In Santa Fe she has co-written and performed in original shows, including Honeymoon in India, A Woman’s Work, and Pregnant Pause. Pamela Thompson has been involved in theater all of her life. She is a comedian and actor and founding member of ARK Repertory Theater in Madison Wisconsin. Thompson co-wrote and performed in the comedies A Woman’s Work and Pregnant Pause.

Lo hizo en la Europa post napoleónica y agonizante, marcada por la escasez, el frío y el desencanto. Fue una época de entierros prematuros y ahogados aparentes que luego resucitaban, de disecciones y discusiones sobre anatomía, de traficantes de cuerpos, del galvanismo y de la búsqueda incesante de una respuesta para el misterio de la vida.  Vivimos en un mundo de mitos y discursos que interpretan la realidad y es tal la fuerza de esas construcciones que son el cristal por donde observamos el devenir de las cosas. Si estas narraciones son ciertas o no, poco importa, ya que reflejan saberes, temores y estereotipos que nos constituyen.  Hoy, como creadores de ""monstruos"", robots, androides, replicantes o ciborgs tenemos nuevos ""espejos negros"" para contemplarnos como especie. La pregunta que queda en el aire es: ¿hasta qué punto nos hacemos responsables del devenir de nuestras creaciones? O bien, ¿nuestras creaciones deberán hacerse responsables de nosotros?"" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In 'Grateful Ganga', an American rock queen shares her love tunes with a Punjabi businessman even as she mourns her dead husband; in 'Snakecharmer', a retired Israeli American professor arrives in India with the intention of committing suicide, only to be saved by a snakecharmer's daughter. Father Tito, the emigre Yugoslav of Father Tito's Onion Rings, is haunted by the Holocaust as he intercedes between Hindu and Muslim rioters. The stories here are about unexpected love and accidental gifts; about finding oneself among strangers; about living elsewhere and living in one's dreams. They parade a full cast of priests, whores, rebels, dead emperors, bush soldiers, poachers, conmen and connoisseurs - angels and demons rubbing shoulders with those whose lives are never quite as ordinary as they seem.

Now there aren't so many animals, nor occasions to encountered them. In The Voice of the Wild, Patricia Beard has collected the best of classic and contemporary fiction and nonfiction in which animals are at the heart of things. Unsentimental images capture the savageness as well as vulnerability of a myriad of species, while at the same time exposing Homo sapiens: an animal that while hunting its fellow creatures sometimes finds a kindred spirit, sometimes the archetypal enemy, but always sees in the wild a reflection of its own mysterious nature.

Rare & Endangered Species demonstrates how a wife and mother's suicide reverberates in the small community where she lived, and affects the lives of people who don't even know her. Finally, Spirits is about the pain that men and women can -- and do -- inflict upon each other. These three very different works illuminate the unadorned core of love -- not the showy, more celebrated sort but what remains when lust, jealousy, and passion have been stripped away.

The Republic is a strangely familiar place--a baroque approximation of Gold Rush era-California with an overlay of Aztec ceremony--yet the characters who populate it are true originals: rockstar magicians, murderous gloves, bouncing boy terrors, blue tinted butlers, sentient squids, and a three-year-old Little Tiny Doom and her vengeful pink plush pig. By turn whimsical and horrific (sometime in the same paragraph), Wilce's stories have been characterized as ""screwball comedies for goths"" but they could also be described as ""historical fantasies"" or ""fanciful histories"" for there are nuggets of historical fact hidden in them there lies.Ysabeau S.

But the plot also goes much deeper, as Pym encounters various interpretative dilemmas, and then leaves the reader with a broken-off ending that defies solution.  Apart from its violence and mystery, the tale calls attention to the act of writing and to the problem of representing truth. Layer upon layer of elaborate hoaxes include its author's own role or posing as ghost-writer of early portions or the narrative; Pym—his only novel—has become the key text for our understanding of Poe.  This edition offers eight short tales which are linked to Pym by their treatment of persistent themes—fantastic voyages, gigantic whirlpools, and premature burials—or by their ironic commentary on Poe's mystification of his readers. --back cover   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Set in the past, present and future, these short stories are unified by their compassion, animated by the unsaid, and distinguished by how beautifully they extract the luminous from the ordinary. Your Father Sends His Love by Stuart Evers is a book of powerful emotion: of vulnerability, duty, betrayal, loss, anger, fear and joy. While its characters often feel more than they can express, they are in the hands of a masterful story teller, who gives time to what might otherwise be incidental, and who dignifies the things that might otherwise pass us by.

The eight-year-old narrator of ""An Ex-Mas Feast"" needs only enough money to buy books and pay fees in order to attend school. Even when his twelve-year-old sister takes to the streets to raise these meager funds, his dream can't be granted. Food comes first. His family lives in a street shanty in Nairobi , Kenya , but their way of both loving and taking advantage of each other strikes a universal chord. In the second of his stories published in a New Yorker special fiction issue, Akpan takes us far beyond what we thought we knew about the tribal conflict in Rwanda . The story is told by a young girl, who, with her little brother, witnesses the worst possible scenario between parents. They are asked to do the previously unimaginable in order to protect their children. This singular collection will also take the reader inside Nigeria, Benin, and Ethiopia , revealing in beautiful prose the harsh consequences for children of life in Africa.Akpan's voice is a literary miracle, rendering lives of almost unimaginable deprivation and terror into stories that are nothing short of transcendent. Bonus ebook content: includes an interview with ""The New Yorker,"" additional photos of the author, discussion questions and topics, and a link to a music download.

One of India's most original and audacious writers, Uday Prakash, weaves three stinging and comic tales of living and surviving in today's globalized India. In his stories, Prakash portrays realities about caste and class with an authenticity rarely seen in English-language fiction about South Asia.

The characters within these territories are real-life survivors, but whether it's a frustrated housewife seeking extreme experience or a young woman contemplating the death of her lover, dark devices and desires rise to the surface. And the human body, too - flawed, visceral, and full of emotional conflict - provides a sensuous frame for each unfolding drama. Uniquely disturbing and deeply erotic, this collection confirms Sarah Hall as one of the greatest writers of her generation. ""The Beautiful Indifference"" includes ""Butcher's Perfume"", which was short-listed for the BBC National Short Story Prize in 2010.

In Friendly Fire he once again demonstrates an extraordinary empathy for lost and searching souls as he focuses on the exquisite emotions of everyday life. In ""The Kitchen Boy"" and ""Dearest Sister Makarim,"" Al Aswany explores the hypocrisy of the class divide. The brief and tender ""Izzat Amin Iskandar"" is a heartrending view of youthful hope. And in the unforgettable novella ""The Isam Abd el-Ati Papers,"" the narrator carries us along a troubling journey through his painful relationships with his artist father and his self-centered mother, en route to a devastating collision of temptation and morality. Here are stories of generational conflict, love, repression, and the clash of Western and Arab ideals, all beautifully rendered by a true modern master.

The Great War is a powerful collection of stories by bestselling authors, each inspired by a different object from the First World War. From a soldier's writing case to the nose of a Zeppelin bomb, each object illuminates an aspect of life during the war, and each story reminds us of the millions of individual lives that were changed forever by the four years of fighting. This remarkable book is illustrated by the Kate Greenaway Medal-winning Jim Kay. It features new work from: AL Kennedy; Tracy Chevalier; Michael Morpurgo; David Almond; Marcus Sedgwick; Adele Geras; Ursula Dubosarsky; John Boyne; Timothee de Fombelle; Sheena Wilkinson; and, Tanya Lee Stone. It is a truly unique and thought-provoking anthology. Gripping stories by some of the world's leading writers will bring the First World War alive for children. Jim Kay won the Kate Greenaway Medal for A Monster Calls, and was recently chosen by J.K. Rowling to illustrate the new full-colour editions of the Harry Potter series. Photographs of the objects which inspired each story will feature in the book. It is published to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War.

A car accident joins strangers linked by an intimate knowledge of madness. A teenage boy remembers his father's act of sudden and self-righteous violence. A 'hurricane party' reunites a couple whom tragedy parted. And, in an unforgettable three-story cycle, an illness heals a man's relationship with his mother and reveals the odd, shifting fidelity of truth to love. Told in fresh, lyrical voices and taut, inventive styles, these narratives explore the complex volatility of love and intimacy, sorrow and renewal. Writing with tough humor, deep humanity, and a keen eye for the natural environment, Bret Anthony Johnston creates a world where cataclysmic events cut people loose from their 'regular lives, floating and spiraling away from where we had been the day before.

We meet longtime neighbors and friends when the ground beneath their feet has shifted in ways they don't yet understand. Here, in small-town Massachusetts, after more than a decade of boom and bust, everyone is struggling to find their own version of the American dream: a lonely woman attacks a memorial to a neighbor's veteran son, a dissatisfied housewife goes overboard with cosmetic surgery on national television, a young father walks away from one of the few jobs left in town, a soldier writes home to a mother who is becoming increasingly unhinged. Life's strange intensity and occasional magic is all around."" -- jacket.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"The Classic Short Story, 1870-1925",Florence Goyet,short_stories,First published in 2014,/works/OL20930505W,/authors/OL3908525A/Florence_Goyet,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32841946M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 219,"The ability to construct a nuanced narrative or complex character in the constrained form of the short story has sometimes been seen as the ultimate test of an author's creativity. Yet during the time when the short story was at its most popular - the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - even the greatest writers followed strict generic conventions that were far from subtle. This expanded and updated translation of Florence Goyet's influential La Nouvelle, 1870-1925: Description d'un genre à son apogée (Paris, 1993) is the only study to focus exclusively on this classic period across different continents. Ranging through French, English, Italian, Russian and Japanese writing - particularly the stories of Guy de Maupassant, Henry James, Giovanni Verga, Anton Chekhov and Akutagawa Ryūnosuke - Goyet shows that these authors were able to create brilliant and successful short stories using the very simple 'tools of brevity' of that period. In this challenging and far-reaching study, Goyet looks at classic short stories in the context in which they were read at the time: cheap newspapers and higher-end periodicals. She demonstrates that, despite the apparent intention of these stories to question bourgeois ideals, they mostly affirmed the prejudices of their readers. In doing so, her book forces us to re-think our preconceptions about this 'forgotten' genre.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In “El Malecón,” a toothless old Dominican man tries to recapture his lost dignity by “borrowing” a shiny convertible Cadillac and driving it along the coastal highway to his childhood village.  In “The Sea Cure,” two travelers in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula confront death in the form of a mysterious woman living in an abandoned beach-front apartment complex.

As a member of a staid old beach club in her town and a self-made business consultant, she is appalled when her brother-in-law sends her an unruly, ill-mannered teenager named Lee-Ann who appears more like a wayward child than competent help. What begins as a promising start to a redemptive relationship between the two ends in a tragedy that lands Faith in a treatment facility, leveled by trauma. Years later, Faith and her mother, Irene, visit Cece in college. A fresh-faced student with a shaved head and new boyfriend, Cece has become a force of her own. Meanwhile, her grandmother, Irene, is in the early stages of dementia. She slips in and out of clarity, telling lucid tales of her own troubled youth. Faith dismisses her mother's stories as bids for attention. The three generations of women hover between wishful innocence and a more knowing resilience against the cruelty that hidden secrets of the past propel into the present.

Arranged Marriage, her first collection of stories, spent five weeks on the San Francisco Chronicle bestseller list and garnered critical acclaim that would have been extraordinary for even a more established author.For the young girls and women brought to life in these stories, the possibility of change, of starting anew, is both as terrifying and filled with promise as the ocean that separates them from their homes in India. From the story of a young bride whose fairy-tale vision of California is shattered when her husband is murdered and she must face the future on her own, to a proud middle-aged divorced woman determined to succeed in San Francisco, Divakaruni's award-winning poetry fuses here with prose for the first time to create eleven devastating portraits of women on the verge of an unforgettable transformation.From the Trade Paperback edition.

In other tales, a team of anthropologists treks to a remote village to record a language's last surviving speaker intoning her native tongue; an elephant and his driver cross the ocean to meet the whims of a Moroccan princess; and Genghis Khan's marauding army steadily approaches an unnamed city's walls. With exuberant originality and startling vision, Tharoor cuts against the grain of literary convention, drawing equally from ancient history and current events. His world-spanning stories speak to contemporary challenges of environmental collapse and cultural appropriation, but also to the workings of legend and their timeless human truths. Whether refashioning the romances of Alexander the Great or confronting the plight of today's refugees, Tharoor writes with distinctive insight and remarkable assurance. Swimmer Among the Stars announces the arrival of a vital, enchanting talent.""--  ""A debut collection of wildly original and intensely imagined stories""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

W. Norton|Language English|Pages 222,"A bold, dazzling debut collection about girls and women in a world where sexuality and self-delusion collide.  In these stories, a teacher obsesses over a student who comes to class with scratch marks on his face; a Catholic girl graduating high school finds a warped kind of redemption in her school’s contrived class rituals; and a woman looking to rent a house is sucked into a strangely inappropriate correspondence with one of the landlords. These are just a few of the powerful plotlines in Suzanne Rivecca’s gorgeously wrought collection. From a college student who adopts a false hippie persona to find love, to a young memoirist who bumps up against a sexually obsessed fan, the characters in these fiercely original tales grapple with what it means to be honest with themselves and the world.  These stories explode “with piercing insight . . . illuminating the dangerous dance between victims and saviors. [They] deliver us to the edge of grief, that precarious place where the moral compass spins—where codes of love and law and religion fail. Mercy here depends on a tiger’s sublime grace, our capacity to resist deeper harm, and the right of every broken being to remain silent” (Melanie Rae Thon). - W. W.

Patient X,David Peace,short_stories,First published in 2018,/works/OL19764787W,/authors/OL7465129A/David_Peace,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 311,"Haunting and evocative, brutal and surreal, these twelve connected tales evoke the life of the Japanese writer Ryūnosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927), whose short story ""In the Grove"" served as an inspiration for Akira Kurosawa's famous film Rashōmon, and whose narrative use of multiple perspectives and different versions of a single event influenced generations of storytellers. Writing out of his own obsession with Akutagawa, David Peace delves into the known facts and events of the writer's life and inner world--birth to a mother who was mentally ill and a father who died shortly thereafter; his own battles with mental illness; his complicated reaction to the beginnings of modernization and Westernization of Japan; his short but prolific writing career; his suicide at the age of thirty-five--and creates a stunningly atmospheric and deeply moving fiction that tells its own story of a singularly brilliant mind.

Now the arc of that achievement appears in one definitive volume: thirty-eight stories drawn from his much-lauded previous collections, and another seven entirely new pieces appearing for the first time in book form. Set in the seedy corners of Key West, the remote shore towns of the Bahamas, and McGuane's hallmark Big Sky country, with its vast and unforgiving landscape, these are stories of people on the fringes of society, whose twisted pasts meddle with their chances for companionship. Moving from the hilarious to the tragic and back again, McGuane writes about familial dysfunction, emotional failure, and American loneliness, celebrating the human ability to persist through life's absurdities""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A few of the stories have never been published before; the others have appeared in The New Yorker, and several of those have also been included in The Best American Short Stories. All are infused with the dazzling, astonishingly creative prose and the remarkable, haunting autobiographical elements that have distinguished Hemon as one of the most original and illustrious voices of our time. What links the stories in Love and Obstacles is the narrator, a young man wholike Hemon himselfwas raised in Yugoslavia and immigrated to the United States. The stories of Love and Obstacles are about that coming of age and the complicationsthe obstaclesof growing up in a Communist but cosmopolitan country, and the disintegration of that country and the consequent uprooting and move to America in young adulthood. But because its Aleksandar Hemon, the stories extend far beyond the immigrant experience; each one is punctuated with unexpected humor and spins out in fabulist, exhilarating directions, ultimately building to an insightful, often heartbreaking conclusion. Woven together, these stories comprise a book that is, genuinely, as cohesive and powerful as any fiction achingly human, charming, and inviting.

Whether set aboard a ship trapped in enemy seas or amidst a showdown in the deserts of Death Valley, his stories brilliantly capture the heroic and indomitable spirit of our great land.From The Listening HillsThe twelve stories in this collection--appearing for the first time in one complete volume--run the spectrum of human emotions as they transport us from the fading majesty of the Old West to a small-town football field to the lonely canyons of one man's mind. These classic tales of adventure, mystery, mysticism, and suspense epitomize the uniquely American yearning for connection and roots, justice and love, as only L'Amour can. Here is a diverse group of heroes and traitors, outlaws and lawmen, the innocent, the guilty, and those who operate in the shadowy territory outside the reach of justice. The wastelands of Death Valley form the backdrop for the tale of a desperate man who leads his pursuers into a desert trap--where heat and thirst are his only weapons. A rodeo rider framed for a crime he didn't commit takes a wild ride on a legendary bronco that may help him catch the real killers. An American pilot flies Russian and British agents into the labyrinthine forests of Asiatic Russia--only to discover that one of them is a traitor. A hit man discovers the fatal limits of friendship; and a quest for revenge becomes a frantic race to find a cache of gold hidden in the drifting sands of the Southwest. And in a powerful and moving parable, an Indian boy must lead his family across a drought-ravaged land with nothing to guide him but his faith.The gripping title story counts down the final hours of a wounded man struggling to fend off his enemies and certain death. Before time runs out, he must finish the most important task of his life: a letter to his unborn son that will vindicate the family name.Filled with a special brand of passion and drama, From the Listening Hills is an exemplary collection that showcases the enduring talents of one of America's most beloved authors.From the Hardcover edition.

Every story here is cut like a stone.""--Chicago Sun-Times), National Book Award--winning Ha Jin gives us a collection that delves into the experience of Chinese immigrants in America. With the same profound attention to detail that is a hallmark of his previous acclaimed works of fiction, Ha Jin depicts here the full spectrum of immigrant life and the daily struggles--some minute, some grand--faced by these intriguing individuals. A lonely composer takes comfort in the antics of his girlfriend's parakeet; young children decide to change their names so that they might sound more ""American,"" unaware of how deeply this will hurt their grandparents; a Chinese professor of English attempts to defect with the help of a reluctant former student. All of Ha Jin's characters struggle in situations that stir within them a desire to remain attached to be loyal to their homeland and its traditions as they explore and avail themselves of the freedom that life in a new country offers. In these stark, deeply moving, acutely insightful, and often strikingly humorous stories, we are reminded once again of the storytelling prowess of this superb writer.From the Hardcover edition.

The title of Hopeful Monsters refers to genetically abnormal organisms that naturally adapt to their environments. In Hiromi Goto's subtle, devastating stories, the hopeful monsters in question are women who will not be tethered by familial duty or the ghosts of their past. They are the walking wounded – a visiting grandfather who cannot abide his ""foreign"" grandchildren; a mother who is terrified by her newborn who bears a tail; a ""stinky girl"" who studies the human condition in a shopping mall. But their wills are a force of nature unto themselves, and their struggles are imbued with the light of myth and magic-realism. Alternately poignant and noisy, these stories establish Hiromi Goto's gift for short fiction that is as shining as her acclaimed novels.

The characters--an array of artists, scientists, songwriters, nannies, horse trainers, and poets--often try to pin down another's point of view, only to find that their own worldview is far from fixed. The characters in McFawn's stories long for and fear the encroachment of others. A young boy reduces his nanny's phone bill with a call, then convinces her he can solve her other problems. A man who works at a butterfly-release business becomes dangerously obsessed with solving a famous mathematical proof. A poetry professor finds himself entangled in the investigation of a murdered student. In the final story, an aging lyricist reconnects with a renowned singer to write an album in the Appalachian Mountains, only to be interrupted by the appearance of his drug-addicted son and a mythical story of recovery. By turns exuberant and philosophically adroit, Bright Shards of Someplace Else reminds us of both the limits of empathy and its absolute necessity. Our misreadings of others may be unavoidable, but they themselves can be things of beauty, charm, and connection.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Almost all the stories in this collection build up to some moment of transcendence, of deep illumination.  There's the girl who finds innocence, trust and grace in the unicorn who comes to her on Good Friday morn; the rabbi who finds 'the fire of God' in the Temple at Jerusalem; the visitor to India who initially is frightened, even disgusted, by some aspects of Hinduism, but achieves understanding and reconciliation.  On other levels, grace and joy are found in the precision of an opal-cutter, the goodness of a circus clown, the purchase of some fish from a market stall.  And the moment of illumination can be reached by surprising routes: in a dancing marathon; in the vulgarity of publicity slogans; in the strange attempt of an irreligious Jew to bring an irreligious Christian to Judaism, only to succeed in bringing him to Christianity.  CG is a writer with not only a theme but an interest in the hidden layers of the mind and their own mysterious ways of emerging.  Her own religious sympathies are deep and exceptionally wide-ranging, and she writes with a beautiful clarity.  Reading her book therefore becomes a moving experience on many levels.

In many of her stories, Simms exposes her own interest in issues concerning time and space. For example, in ""Rebel Airplanes,"" an L.A. engineer works by day on city sewers and by night on R-C planes that she yearns to launch into the cosmos. The character-driven stories in Meet Behind Mars offer beautiful insight into the emotional lives of caretakers, auto workers, dancers, and pawn shop employees. In ""High Country,"" a frustrated would-be novelist considers ditching her family in the middle of the desert. In ""Dive,"" an adoptee returns to her adoptive home, still haunted by histories she does not know. Simms writes from the voice of women and girls who struggle under structural oppression and draws from the storytelling tradition best represented by writers like Edward P. Jones, whose characters have experiences that are specific to black Americans living in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Styron also created personal but no less powerful tales based on his real-life experiences as a U.S. Marine. The Suicide Run collects five of these meticulously rendered narratives. One of them--""Elobey, Annobon, and Corisco""--is published here for the first time. In ""Blankenship,"" written in 1953, Styron draws on his stint as a guard at a stateside military prison at the end of World War II. ""Marriott, the Marine"" and ""The Suicide Run""--which Styron composed in the early 1970s as part of an intended novel that he set aside to write Sophie's Choice--depict the surreal experience of being conscripted a second time, after World War II, to serve in the Korean War. ""My Father's House"" captures the isolation and frustration of a soldier trying to become a civilian again. In ""Elobey, Annobon, and Corisco,"" written late in Styron's life, a soldier attempts to exorcise the dread of an approaching battle by daydreaming about far-off islands, visited vicariously through his childhood stamp collection.  Perhaps the last volume from one of literature's greatest voices, The Suicide Run brings to life the drama, inhumanity, absurdity, and heroism that forever changed the men who served in the Marine Corps.From the Hardcover edition.

Another compilation, Mosses from an Old Manse, followed in 1846 and achieved further success.

Over three generations, the circus transforms this small town, providing a magical backdrop to daily life. In Lima, Indiana, meeting an elephant can change a man's life or the manner of his death. Jeanne Dixianna entices men with her dazzling Spin of Death and keeps them in line with secrets locked in a cedar box. The lonely wife of the show's manager has each room of her house painted like a sideshow banner, indulging her desperate passion for the young painter. And a loveless marriage in his post-circus job at Clown Alley Cleaners. In Lima, legend and lore outlive the circus itself, luring contemporary inhabitants to faraway places in search of the adventure that has moved on.  The connected tales of The Circus in Winter display the rise and fall of an American circus. Cathy Day follows the performers and their progeny into history, vividly bringing the everyday lives of circus people to the page.    --front flap   Read more Read less",8 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

The young men and boys in this bold, fiery collection do the unthinkable to prove to themselves – to everyone – that they are strong enough to face the heartbreak in this world.

'Benjamin Percy moves instinctively toward the molten center of contemporary writing, the place where genre fiction... overflows its boundaries and becomes something dark and grand and percipient.

Meg's brother (Jeremy) asked her to collect his soldier-friend to spend the holidays with them. Jeremy was detained but would be along soon.    Although having the same name as the intended visitor, the Major soon realizes that he is the wrong soldier. However, he is having such a splendid time, he has a hard time telling Meg about the error. Meg refuses to hear his confession'' -- thinking he is confessing to something else. However, everything is explained when Jeremy and Captain John Howard arrive.  THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER ( Mary Balogh)    Six year-old Anna has one wish for Christmas - a new Mama.

But his tiny daughter has other ideas; she zeroes in on a new visitor, Emma.    The reader soon learns that Lord Radbrook and Emma have an unfortunate history; one of which Anna knows nothing. But the heart does not worry about the past, only finding a happy present and future.  HOME FOR CHRISTMAS (Melinda McRae)    Ashley Sutton is the second son and has been at sea for 16 years.

The only people still home are several servants and Rose Norris, governess to the children of his older brother.    Rose is an orphan and she immediately recognizes what Ashley needs; she helps him create a Christmas at his home before he travels to greet his family at his uncle's home. Lovely.  THE DARK MAN (Edith Layton)    Eve Swanson, in her first season becomes engaged to the Earl of Poole.

"Wild child, and other stories",T. Coraghessan Boyle,short_stories,First published in 2010,/works/OL892001W,/authors/OL78930A/T._Coraghessan_Boyle,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24257577M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  New York|Language English,"A superb new collection from ""a writer who can take you anywhere"" (The New York Times) In the title story of this rich new collection, T.C. Boyle has created so vivid and original a retelling of the story of Victor, the feral boy who was captured running naked through the forests of Napoleonic France, that it becomes not just new but definitive: yes, this is how it must have been. The tale is by turns magical and moving, a powerful investigation of what it means to be human.There is perhaps no one better than T.C. Boyle at engaging, shocking, and ultimately gratifying his readers while at the same time testing his characters' emotional and physical endurance. The fourteen stories gathered here display both Boyle's astonishing range and his imaginative muscle. Nature is the dominant player in many of these stories, whether in the form of the catastrophic mudslide that allows a cynic to reclaim his own humanity (""La Conchita"") or the wind-driven fires that howl through a high California canyon (""Ash Monday""). Other tales range from the drama of a man who spins Homeric lies in order to stop going to work, to that of a young woman who must babysit for a $250,000 cloned Afghan and the sad comedy of a child born to Mexican street vendors who is unable to feel pain.Brilliant, incisive, and always entertaining, Boyle's short stories showcase the mischievous humor and socially conscious sensibility that have made him one of the most acclaimed writers of our time.

Young and ambitious Anna puts her career on hold to support her husband through medical school, only to find out she’s pregnant when it’s her turn. Troubled and difficult from the start, Anna’s daughter, Poppy, hasn’t been home since she drove away with the man who came to buy the family’s VW bus. After a twelve-year absence, Poppy begs to reunite with her now widowed mother, only to disappear again, leaving her mysterious and wildly imaginative young daughter, Flynn, in Anna’s care. This is also the story of Jack and Stuart, a couple struggling with commitment despite their love for one another. When Jack and Stuart meet Anna in a support group, they feel a connection that eventually leads them to form a loving, if unlikely, family. Gorgeously written and imbued with both wisdom and humor, Above the Thunder reminds us that created families can be every bit as vital as the families into which we are born. About the Author Renee Manfredi received her MFA from Indiana University, a fellowship from The National Endowment for the Arts, and was a regional winner of Granta’s Best American Novelists Under 40. Her story collection, Where Love Leaves Us, won the Iowa Short Fiction award. Her short stories have been published in The Mississippi Review, The Iowa Review, The Georgia Review, and the Pushcart Prize anthology, and featured in NPR’s “Selected Shorts” series. Manfredi is currently an Associate Professor at the University of Alaska. Above the Thunder is her first novel.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They strike the deepest, most troubling emotions, the ones it's impossible to resolve or restrain, the ones that arise mysteriously, linger obnoxiously, and dissipate with excruciating slowness-except that these stories never allow their characters to shake the emotions off. Instead the characters-and stories-pursue their feelings to the nth degree. Children are haunted by the plagues visiting their home one summer. A woman grieves the twin sister she lost as a child and falls in love with a man who will never love her. A musician wanders the streets of Paris searching for and mourning his girlfriend, who may be dead-or may simply have left him forever. Overcome with jealousy, a young woman murders her brother's male lover. A mountain climber retires to the mid-west and aches to reconnect with the family he also disdains. An elderly New Yorker moves to the desert of southern California, where she suddenly and unexpectedly experiences joy. In these stories, feelings sneak up on the characters, leave them stunned and struggling to figure out what's hit them.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Coyote is one of Canada's most acclaimed storytellers; her first three collections were insightful, deeply personal stories about gender, identity, and community. Ivan's most recent book, Bow Grip (2006), was her first novel; it won the ReLit Award, was shortlisted for the Ferro-Grumley Fiction Prize in the US, and was named a Stonewall Honor Book by the American Library Association.  With The Slow Fix, Ivan returns to her short story roots in a collection that is disarming, warm, and funny while at the same time subverting our pre-conceived notions of gender roles. In ""By Any Other Name,"" Ivan gets into some serious male bonding with her Uncle Rob; in ""The Curse?"" a cousin's stepdaughter helps her to overcome her lifelong dread of buying tampons; and in the title story, she does her best to fix what's wrong in the world by telling the homophobe in the barber's seat next to hers to shut up. Ivan excels at finding the small yet significant truths in our everyday gestures and interactions. By doing so, she helps us to embrace not what makes us women or men, but human beings.

Since the 1930s he has been unchallenged in his ability to portray the professional man in American society and has written the best American novels about clergymen, lawyers, and military men.

Something is out there: stories,Richard Bausch,short_stories,First published in 2010,/works/OL14858295W,/authors/OL20930A/Richard_Bausch,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24252156M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Alfred A. Knopf|Language English,"From the prizewinning novelist and world-renowned short-story writer, the author of 2008's universally acclaimed novel Peace (""A brilliant one-act drama depicting the futility and moral complexity of combat"" --The New York Times), eleven indelible new tales that showcase the electrifying artistry of a master. A husband confronts the power of youth and the inexorable truths of old age. A son sits by his mother's bedside determined to give her what she needs in her final days, even though doing so means breaking his own heart. A brief adulterous tryst illuminates the fragility of our most intimate relations. A young man returns in the face of crisis to the parents he once rejected. A divorced young woman dealing with slowly increasing despair develops an obsesion about a note that fell from the pocket of a man who came to eat in the cafe where she works. A wife whose husband has been shot must weather a terrible snowstorm with her two sons, as well as a storm of doubt about the extent of his involvement in a crime.Richard Bausch's stories contend with transfixing themes: marital and familial estrangement, ways of trespass, the intractable mysteries and frights of daily life in these times, the uncertainty of knowledge and truth, the gulfs between friends and lovers, the frailty of even the most abiding love--while underlining throughout the persistence of love, the obdurate forces that connect us. His consummate skill, penetrating wit, and unfailing emotional generosity are on glorious display in this fine new collection.From the Hardcover edition.

Being with Melanie gives me hopes and ideas. I could find room in my flat for this girl; I could swap strains of the virus with her, give my T-cells something to whinge about. And it’s just then it sinks in that I’m going to outlive her, and in this moment of loneliness, the world feels transient and flimsy, a girls’ fashion that will be memory by winter, that already is a memory.  A Welsh farmer’s wife during the Second World War kills the land-girl her husband has taken as his lover. A leader of the Cornish-language revival commits her last act of protest the day Russian troops march into Berlin. A lonely man on the waterfront at Llandudno wonders whether he or his girlfriend will be first to die of Aids, and a bored man in a restaurant in Cardiff Bay invents a story of arrest and torture in Czechoslovakia to amuse his petulant lover.  ‘These stories are a rare kind of joy. Even when they approach moments of discontent and danger they bring to the reader an optimism founded in human relationships. This is a wonderful collection.’ ~Prof Graeme Harper, Editor, New Writing.  ‘Humour and pity often arise from the characters’ inability to understand themselves and those close to them. In suggesting both the truth and the self-deception Mimpriss not only engages our sympathy but makes us question our assumptions about ourselves’ ~Caroline Clark, gwales.com  ‘There is nothing ostentatious about his writing: most of his characters lead unremarkable lives; there are few dramatic plot developments; the writing does not draw attention to itself. And yet the best of these pieces express something important about psychology and human relationships, and the sparseness of the writing is capable of considerable power.’ ~Brian George, The Short Review.  ‘In Llandudno today a woman crossed the road as we passed in the car and this action triggered the memory of a moment in a story by Rob Mimpriss when a character crosses the road in Llandudno. This means the story has gone to where all good stories need to go in readers - deep into the imagination, to live there. The story is called “Valiant” in the collection For His Warriors. I recommend it. Highly. It feels to me already a classic.’ ~Fiona Owen, author, The Green Gate and editor, Scintilla.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Or they would have named it for you, a permanent mark, just for being here.""From a new talent that Annie Proulx has called an ""important emerging writer"" comes a surprising and expansive collection of stories, steeped in the lore of the frontier but unmistakably fresh and of our time.         When We Were Wolves roams over a West we never knew existed--colonized by rogues and tricksters, Custer impersonators, firefighters with a weakness for arson, and the other rootless folk who come to rest under the vast and forgiving desert sky. Jon Billman writes about accidental lives: people who are trapped in unsuitable marriages, impossible situations, but who handle them with the odd grace of those who are determined to live by their own strange code. He mingles the skewed humor of David Sedaris with the loping, rough-edged appeal of Tom McGuane. This is a beguiling new entry on the map of American fiction.From the Hardcover edition.

Over the next two decades, he returned to these characters again and again, tracing their years together raising children, finding and losing moments of romantic rapport, and facing the heartbreak of infidelity and estrangement. Now these stories appear in a single volume in hardcover for the first time, with the addition of a later story, ""Grandparenting,"" which returns us to the Maples long after their wrenching divorce. Together, The Maples Stories offers a nuanced portrait of a flawed marriage between two sympathetic, well-intentioned practitioners of twentieth-century family life.""--BOOK JACKET.

It is the experience of ordinary people who, on second glance, have led truly extraordinary lives. She developed an appreciation for their words, wit, & wisdom & has made it her life's work to pass along their experiences. In this collection of original short stories, she pays homage to these ordinary folks through lyrical tributes, many of which have aired or will air on National Public Radio. Beginning late this year, her own program, Just Plain Folks: Wisdom from the Front Porch, will air weekly on NPR. Like her radio segments, the stories in Just Plain Folks are meant both to entertain & to educate. Each story concludes with an author's note that places it in its proper cultural context.

Henry,"" Elizabeth Bowen once remarked, ""nobody has done more than William Saroyan to endear and stabilize the short story.""     Saroyan, who burst upon the scene in 1934 with his celebrated short-story collection The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze, enjoyed a long and prolific literary career. Famous for his novels and plays (including The Human Comedy and The Time of Your Life), he also published sixteen acclaimed story collections. ""It came as something of a shock then, after the author's death in 1981,"" the editor Leo Hamalian notes, ""to realize that Saroyan hadn't published a collection of his short stories since The Whole Voyald in 1956, a period of twenty-five years that also represents half of his writing life.""     Uncollected until now are the masterly late pieces he published in The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, and Harper's in the 1960s and '70s. Ranging from the homely and congenially human world of immigrant families to the life of an expatriate writer--with children--abroad, the stories of Madness in the Family give an overpowering sense of the fullness of life. Saroyan's singular voice--equal parts clean and shrewd humor--serves a cup brimful of what rare and happy luck it is to be alive.

Does it exist, or is it merely a means of keeping another reality at bay?Not the End of the World is Kate Atkinson's first collection of short stories. Playful and profound, they explore the world we think we know whilst offering a vision of another world which lurks just beneath the surface of our consciousness, a world where the myths we have banished from our lives are startlingly present and where imagination has the power to transform reality.From Charlene and Trudi, obsessively making lists while bombs explode softly in the streets outside, to gormless Eddie, maniacal cataloguer of fish, and Meredith Zane who may just have discovered the secret to eternal life, each of these stories shows that when the worlds of material existence and imagination collide, anything is possible.

Some went so far as to propose that these “intermediate sexes” might, in fact, constitute a totally different species, even serve as intrepid guides in our march toward an uncertain future. The five speculative stories in Theodore McCombs’s kaleidoscopic collection span several possible worlds, teasing the boundaries between coexisting realities and taking up the question of queer difference from one surprising vantage after another.

Whether they find themselves walking the fertile farmland of south Texas, steering trucks through the suffocating sprawl of Houston, or turning logs into loose leaf in the mills just west of the Sabine River, the men of these stories find themselves beset by the insufficiencies of their own ingrained ideas of manhood.  Like Richard Russo, Bruce Machart has a profound knowledge of the male psyche and a gift for conveying the absurdity and brutality of daily life with humor and compassion. Alternately lush with lyricism and starkly candid, these stories emerge from inside a vividly scrutinized everyday of farms, refineries, hospitals, and homes to explore what it means to be a man at the rise of a new millennium. What it means to be a man who can't protect his wife from violence, or protect his children from tragic accidents, or protect himself from loss and heartbreak. Machart's characters have a deep and abiding humanity that makes their hardscrabble lives all the more unforgettable""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This heart-warming collection of stories revolves around the lives, relationships, triumphs and failures of the good people of Hockam and of the lawyers to whom they look for help. We meet the lonely dentist and his noisy neighbours, the TV celebrity chef and his complex family, the policeman and his beloved budgies, the Vicar and the Major General, the greedy beneficiary of an uncle's Will. These and many others bring their problems to Dufty Dufty Popple & Dunn to be resolved by the long-suffering and well-meaning members of the firm, all of whom have their own lives to live when time permits, from Bernard, the hapless trainee, to Hugo Dufty, the nominal senior partner. And then, of course, there are the ever-present rumours concerning Robert Popple, the former partner who departed from the firm some years previously in mysterious circumstances. The whole symphony of life portrayed here is conducted with gentle humour and charm by Hugo's father, Charles Dufty, who founded the firm fifty years ago and whose wisdom and deep understanding of the human condition helps to make sense of even the most difficult and apparently insoluble problems. In this humorous and touching debut collection, Alan Hammond paints a timeless portrait of life in a rural English town...""--Publisher description.

Evenings at five,Gail Godwin,short_stories,First published in 2003,/works/OL1865751W?edition=ia%3Aeveningsatfive00godw,/authors/OL223339A/Gail_Godwin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3777993M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  Ballantine Books|Language English|Pages 114,"Every evening at five o'clock, Christina and Rudy stopped work and began the ritual commonly known as Happy Hour. Rudy mixed Christina's drink with loving precision, the cavalier slosh of Bombay Sapphire over ice shards, before settling across from her in his Stickley chair with his glass of Scotch. They shared a love of language and music (she is an author, he a composer, after all), a delight in intense conversation, a fascination with popes, and nearly thirty years of life together.What did I think, that we had forever? muses Christina, seven months after Rudy's unexpected death. While coming to terms with her loss, with the space that Rudy once inhabited, Christina reflects on their vibrant bond--with all its quirks, habits, and unguarded moments--as well as her passionate sorrow and her attempts to reposition herself and her new place in the very real world they shared.In this literary jewel, a bittersweet novella of absence and presence and the mysterious gap between them, Gail Godwin has performed a small miracle. In essence, Evenings at Five is a grief sonata for solo instrument transposed into words. Interwoven with meditations and movements, full of aching truths and a wicked sense of humor, it exquisitely captures the cyclical nature of commitment--and the eternal quality of a romance completed.

The book is anchored by the full text of the provocatively topical title novella that appeared in Harper's, a sometimes farcical, ultimately tragic story about the president of an international lending institution accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper in a New York hotel. Recalling the Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair with irony and compassion, Kalfus skewers international political gridlock and the hypocrisies of acceptable sexual conduct. In ""The Moment They Were Waiting For,"" a murderer on death row casts a spell granting the inhabitants of his city the foreknowledge of the dates they will die. In ""The Large Hadron Collider,"" a judge distracted by the faint possibility of an adulterous affair must decide whether to throw out a nuisance lawsuit that raises the even fainter possibility that the entire Earth may be destroyed. ""The Un"" is a nostalgic story of a young writer's struggles as he tries to surmount the colossal, heavily guarded wall that apparently separates writers who have been published from those who have not. Varying boldly in theme, setting, and tone, the stories in Coup de Foudre share Kalfus's distinctive humour and intellect, inextricably bound with high literary ambition.

In this anthology, notable, bestselling, and award-winning writers each chose a Rush song as the spark for a new story, drawing inspiration from the visionary trio that is Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart. Enduring stark dystopian struggles or testing the limits of the human spirit, the characters populating 2113 find strength while searching for hope in a world that is repressive, dangerous, or just debilitatingly bland. Most of these tales are science fiction, but some are fantasies, thrillers, even edgy mainstream. Many of Rushs big hits are represented, as well as deeper cuts . . . with wonderful results. This anthology also includes the seminal stories that inspired the Rush classics “Red Barchetta” and “Roll the Bones,” as well as Kevin J. Andersons novella sequel to the groundbreaking Rush album 2112. 2113 contains stories by New York Times bestselling authors Kevin J. Anderson, Michael Z. Williamson, David Mack, David Farland, Dayton Ward, and Mercedes Lackey; award winners Fritz Leiber, Steven Savile, Brad R.

Some readers noticed his nimble blending of humor with painful truths reminded them of George Saunders. His creativity and fresh voice reminded others of Wells Tower's Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned. But with his new collection, Jodzio creates a class of his own. Knockout is the unified collection of stories that create flawless portraits of deeply flawed figures on the edge of the American Dream. A recovering drug addict gets tricked into stealing a tiger. A man buys a used sex chair from his neighbor. A woman suffering from agoraphobia raises her son completely indoors. An alcoholic runs a bed and breakfast with the son from his deceased wife's first marriage. These people will admit that their chances have passed them by. These people know they were born on the wrong side of the tracks, and their dreams will remain unreachable, but that doesn't stop them from dreaming. Yet readers won't be fooled by the funny premises -Jodzio steers these stories into deeper places, creating a brilliant examination of those on the fringes of modern life. With its quirky humor, compelling characters, and unexpected sincerity, Knockout by John Jodzio is poised to become his breakout book, drawing a wide readership to this provocative and talented young writer.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sons challenge fathers and break taboos. Crackling with tension and propelled by jagged, cutting dialogue, D.W. Wilson's stories reveal to us how our best intentions can be doomed to fail or injure, how our loves can fall short or mislead us, how even friendship - especially friendship - can be something dangerously temporary.

Tóibín is a master at portraying mute emotion, intense intimacies that remain unacknowledged or unspoken. In this stunning collection, he cements his status as “his generation’s most gifted writer of love’s complicated, contradictory power” (Los Angeles Times).  “Silence” is a brilliant historical set piece about Lady Gregory, widowed and abandoned by her lover, who tells the writer Henry James a confessional story at a dinner party. In “Two Women,” an eminent Irish set designer, aloof and prickly, takes a job in her homeland, and is forced to confront devastating emotions she has long repressed. “The New Spain” is the story of an intransigent woman who returns home after a decade in exile and shatters the fragile peace her family has forged in the post-Franco world. And in the breathtaking long story “The Street,” Tóibín imagines a startling relationship between two Pakistani workers in Barcelona—a taboo affair in a community ruled by obedience and silence.  Tóibín’s characters are often difficult and combative, compelled to disguise their vulnerability and longings. Yet he unmasks them, and in doing so offers us a set of extraordinarily moving stories that remind us of the fragility and individuality of human life. As The New York Review of Books has said, Tóibín “understands the tenuousness of love and comfort—and, after everything, its necessity.”   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each story illustrates why Kate Chopin is read now with such pleasure and recognition and was so firmly censored and castigated at the end of the nineteenth century. Her characters are full of life, faults and passion; she wrote with relish of great love, of unsatisfactory marriage, of the nature and implications of illicit romance and adultery.  Most of the stories are set in Louisiana where 'the dominant mood is one of well-nigh drunken reverie . . of soft langour creeping through the blood and mounting surely to the brain . Creoles, French Acadians and blacks are all portrayed as hedonistic, high spirited, superstitious and volatile. The relationships between their cultures provide much of the drama— and humour — in the stories, as do the relationships between the sexes.  The rage and despair with which so many woman writers speak the truth of women's experience are rarely present in Kate Chopin's work. Her knowledge of the ways in which a woman's life is circumscribed is used to effect, but in many stories, against the odds, the woman hero has the last laugh or at least a much-enjoyed moment of triumph.  Kate Chopin is earthy, optimistic, humorous and shrewd. Her stories are, as Helen Taylor describes in her excellent introduction to the collection, both an inspiration and a delight.    --back cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Stalcup is a writer who manages to suggest the possibility of goodness without sacrificing a tough-minded insistence on reporting foibles and follies, often of the comic variety. Beyond its interest in narrative innovation, And Yet It Moves is an important collection because of its successful exploration of the territory that exists in the intersections between scientific, cultural, and spiritual theory and philosophy.

The motif and title story, 'The Figure in the Carpet', is an inspired joke, a masterpiece of double-entendre that demands the reader's undivided love and attention and continues to baffle its critics. Also included are 'The Author of Beltraffio', an absorbing story of family infighting, authorship and tragedy, and 'The Private Life', a spirited tale that considers the contrast between the artist alone and at work. While many of these stories appear to be elaborate Jamesian games, all employ irony and humour to allegorize artistic creation.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Responsibility:     edited by Lorrie Moore.    Abstract:    ""When writers of fiction have made the effort to explore the mottled landscape of a child's secrets and understanding, they have often created stories of ferocious poignancy,"" writes Lorrie Moore in her introduction to this dazzling collection of stories about childhood. I Know Some Things presents the innocence and knowingness of a child's-eye view as it confronts the contradictions and hypocrisies of the adult world.  Some of today's best writers, including Margaret Atwood, Toni Cade Bambara, Harold Brodkey, Spalding Gray, Jamaica Kincaid, Susan Minot, Alice Munro and Amy Tan, capture childhood incidents that are comic, startling, touching and disturbing. Each story is told by a child character or by the adult who was that child, skillfully preserving the child's voice and role as actor and witness in the drama.  The stories all explore pivotal moments in childhood when something becomes known, something is tested, some turning point reached. With ""the wily, rhetorical manipulations and inventions of someone not yet part of the grown-up world,"" writes Moore, child narrators show us the ways in which adult actions resonate through children, and the real import of childhood perceptions, allegiances and decisions. Chosen for their insight and sheer literary brilliance, these stories range across age, gender, class, ethnicity and geography. Together they disrupt easy notions of childhood obliviousness and naivete, and will not fail to touch the child in any adult.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Rendered in the American vernacular with vivid imagery and a wry, dark sense of humor, these thwarted and sometimes violent lives jump off the page at the reader with inexorable force. A father pumps his son full of steroids so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor.With an artistic instinct honed on the works of Flannery O'Connor and Harry Crews, Pollock offers a powerful work of fiction in the classic American vein. Knockemstiff is a genuine entry into the literature of place.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|0 Currently reading|3 Have read

Here are two classic novellas as well: The Temptation of Jack Orkney and The Other Woman, which exemplify Lessing's grasp of the most essential human psychology. Rich and various in mood and background--the settings range across England and France--these stories powerfully convey the uncompromising insight, intelligence, and vision of one of the most ardently admired writers of our time.From the Hardcover edition.

Whether it is a fascination with soap opera, an intense sensitivity to their own difference, or an obsession with a certain part of the male anatomy, gay kids — or kids who eventually identify themselves as gay — have an indefinable but unmistakable gay sensibility. Sometimes the result is funny, sometimes it is harrowing, and often it is deeply moving.  Essays by lauded young writers like Alex Chee (Edinburgh), Aaron Hamburger (Faith for Beginners), K. M. Soehnlein (The World of Normal Boys), Trebor Healy (Through It Came Bright Colors), Tom Dolby (The Trouble Boy), David Bahr, and Austin Bunn, are collected along with those by brilliant newcomers such as Michael McAllister, Jason Tougaw, Viet Dinh, and the wildly popular blogger Joe.My.God.

Un fallido intento de intercambio de cadáveres ilustres -- los de Evita y Aramburu -- con la ayuda de un camión cisterna como vehículo y refugio; la vida de una mujer que despliega todos los días una coreografía en una estación de trenes neoyorquina; la semblanza irónica de un niño prodigio destruido por una madre posesiva; el enfrentamiento entre el ejército y unos obreros en las afueras de la ciudad de Tucumán poco después del '55, y las legendarias andanzas de dos asaltantes de la década del treinta son algunas de las historias que abordan estos cuentos. Al filo de la crónica periodística o lanzados a las más delirantes maquinaciones de la ficción, estos relatos brillan por su absoluta vigencia y confirman la dimensión literaria de un autor imprescindible."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The practical heart,Allan Gurganus,short_stories,First published in 1993,/works/OL2719545W?edition=ia%3Apracticalheartfo00gurg,/authors/OL397982A/Allan_Gurganus,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23245714M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Knopf|Language English|Pages 322,"Allan Gurganus's voice--by turn bawdy and serene, folkloric and profane--deepens as it soars into this quiet masterwork. Four new fables--rich in event, comedy, experience--surge with the force of history's headlines versus sidestreet human fortitude. Improbable heroes and heroines spiral outward from Gurganus's familiar Carolina terrain. Each fires into a wild and differing direction, all in quest of some fantasy that's practically impossible:  --An impoverished immigrant has her portrait painted (or not) by John Singer Sargent.  --A young man's devotion to saving eighteenth-century homes—and their odd lingering ghosts—helps him find unlikely ways to renovate his own mortality.  --A pillar of the community becomes, over the course of one cartoon matinee, its pariah.  --A beloved, transfixingly homely father shows his village and his only son a decency stronger than race,    humiliation, or even death itself.  These characters' quixotic missions prove mysterious, often even to themselves. Their legacies are not easily deciphered. And yet, their most impractical wishes soon become the heartiest facts about each. They manage to wrest battle-courage from everyday indecision. Out of superstition and convention, they lift certainty. They each find a wealth of consoling truths banked--immortal--in the all-too-human heart.  Allan Gurganus's great powers--announced more than a decade ago by Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All--here achieve a yearning exuberance worthy of a new Whitman. These leaps of sexual longing, empathy, and faith become a major new gift from this essential fablemaker.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The stories in Refund reflect our contemporary world-swindlers, reality show creators, desperate artists, siblings, parents - who try to answer the question: What is the real definition of worth? In ""Theft,"" an eighty-year-old swindler, accustomed to tricking people for their money, boards a cruise ship to see if she can find something of true value-a human connection. In ""Anything for Money,"" the creator of a reality show is thrown into the real world when his estranged granddaughter reenters his life in need of a new heart; and in the title story, young artist parents in downtown Manhattan escape the attack on 9/11 only to face a battle over their subletted apartment with a stranger who might have lost more than only her deposit.

Robert Schneider schreibt unerwartet, ist kritisch, richtet den Blick auf Geschehenes oder Ersehntes.  In 101 Geschichten führt uns Robert Schneider in alte chinesische Dynastien, an das südliche Ende des Central Parks in New York, zum Präsidenten aus dem Land der blauen Berge, in ein Dorf im Wallis oder im Vorarlberg, zu Schah Abbas dem Großen aus der Dynastie der Safawiden oder auch direkt ins Märchenland.  Dort lässt er etwa zwei Schuhe trefflich über rechts und links streiten, und darüber, ob heutzutage diese politischen Kategorien noch taugen. Erdbeeren mokieren sich über eine ins Beet gefallene Zitrone oder Einkaufswagen debattieren über die Grenzen der kapitalistischen Wirtschaft und kommen auf Adorno zu sprechen.  Schneider macht uns bekannt mit Podrhasky, der dem Tod begegnet, und mit einem Obdachlosen, der sich mittels großer religiöser Gesten Kleingeld erbettelt und einen ziemlich coolen Teenager zumindest ein wenig verunsichert oder ihm gar eine Erkenntnis vermittelt.  Viele Geschichten laufen auf eine Art Fabelmoral hinaus, oder besser: Sie scheinen darauf hinauszulaufen. Denn oft, fast immer, dreht Schneider die kurzen Geschichten, lässt das Unerwartete, das Gegenläufige einbrechen und weitet so den Horizont der Texte, verschränkt Authentisches und Erfundenes. Dabei scheut er weder das Pathos noch die Ironie, die er zuweilen ins Übersteigerte und Absurde führt.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

El tema con el que se las invitó a participar era muy amplio: el cuerpo de la mujer, la naturaleza de la mujer, las vidas de la mujer. La pubertad, el embarazo, la menopausia, todos los cuerpos distintos que están en un cuerpo se narran aquí con ironía y asombro, con ternura y descaro, con crudeza, sin miramientos, y con todo el talento de que son capaces autoras como Carme Riera, Zoé Valdés, Marta Rivera de la Cruz, Lucía Etxebarria, Espido Freire, Carmen Amoraga, Nuria Amat, Ángela Vallvey, Rosa Regàs y Maria de la Pau Janer. El libro se abre con un texto del doctor Dexeus, sin duda el ginecólogo más reconocido de nuestro país, que además de conocer como nadie la naturaleza femenina, ha trabajado constantemente en ampliar y consolidar las libertades de la mujer en momentos sonrojantes de nuestro pasado.

One such phrase came to me on a streetcar on my way home from work – “the closets of time”– and it resonated with what I was reading – the works of H.P. Lovecraft. The phrase stayed with me for the rest of the day, until late evening, when it gave birth to the idea behind this anthology.  “What would happen, I thought to myself, if I invited a group of writers to each create a short fiction entitled 'The Closets of Time'? The works then would be assembled into an anthology entitled The Closets of Time, but the individual works would, of necessity, not be individually titled within the book. The interest and excitement was in how each writer would manifest the ideas of 'closets' and 'time' in his or her writing, and what kind of echoes or resonances would be evident across all the works.  “I wanted the anthology to span genres, from speculative fiction to experimental work to surrealism, for instance; I wanted imaginative writers whose command of their craft meant they felt comfortable taking risks with their writing, dangerous perhaps in their language and structure. Beverley Daurio and I determined a list of writers consultatively, and invitations to contribute went out, to writers in Canada and the United States, some of whom we knew, and some total strangers. The seventeen writers herein took up the challenge of creating a new work specifically for this book; and together they have formed The Closets of Time.”—Richard Truhlar   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Morph zusammengefügt, der immer glaubte, keine Erlebnisse zu haben, aber welche hatte. In meist verqueren Situationen schafft sich dieser Zeitgenosse seinen speziellen Durchblick und handelt dann auf befremdliche Weise mit ausgefallenem Ergebnis. Wie jeder Mensch hat es auch Herr A. Morph schwer. Was soll er machen, wenn er dauernd die falschen Türen öffnet, Frau Morph unerbittlich für das Wiedererwachen seiner Potenz sorgt, wenn er einen Mord aufklären muß, der nicht zu beweisen ist, und wenn er, während er einem Armen helfen will, beinahe an einer Straftat mitwirkt? Da wundert es kaum, daß Herr A. Morph gelegentlich einem kleinen Rachegefühl nachgibt oder auf der Rolltreppe des Warenhauses einfach mal zum Mount Everest fährt.§Johanna Braun und Günter Braun schreiben getrennt und veröffentlichen vereint. So enstanden ihre Kurzgeschichtenbände 'Die Nase des Neandertalers', 'Fünf Säulen des Eheglücks', 'Der Fehlfaktor' und 'Der x-mal vervielfachte Held'. Nach derselben Methode sind diese Geschichten zusammengekommen. Drei deutsche Rundfunkanstalten haben schon A. Morph-Geschichten gesendet, frühmorgens, spätabends und zwischendurch. Überall, wo eine kurzweilige Bekanntschaft gewünscht wird, ist Herr A. Morph zu Diensten.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The first story, ""One of Our Stars,"" is about a professor so engrossed in difficult studies that even a blatant sexual invitation (accepted) merely distracts him. He concentrates with the mental force of a chess grandmaster, a zen roshi, or a musical virtuoso. The next story about a female college student is set in a Colombian jungle. The third story portrays a once formidable professor coming to terms with retirement, old age, and approaching death. The fourth (title) story, novella length, takes place in an Ecuadorian library that is experiencing rampant theft. A place where some men steal books while others wonder why they bother. A literary, intellectual mystery that explores the library as a profound idea while the world rushes into a digital, post-literate future. The fifth story explores the evolving status of a beautiful young female scholar who each year attends a Latin American Librarians Conference   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Six cousins, descendants of the wealthy Victorian merchant Rutland Shearsby, are all healthy and in their prime, survivors of the worst war in history. Then one of them, an army captain in London, abruptly steps into the path of a speeding van and meets instant death. A few months later, his cousin, a writer, is found in a remote country lane, his head smashed against a stone wall. And a few days afterward, another cousin, a rural schoolteacher, is discovered in her cottage, poisoned to death. Of the six, now only three remain.  A bizarre confluence of accidents? Or has there been foul play? Parmiter, an eccentric obituarist in possession of some disturbing facts about the deaths, attempts to persuade Harvey Tuke, the most venerated man in the public prosecutor's office, to look into this abrupt rise in one family's mortality rate. Tuke remains skeptical until he runs into a fourth Shearsby cousin, panic-stricken and convinced that someone has been trying to kill her.  Thus begins one of the most extraordinary cases in modern British detective fiction. Caught in a mind-boggling maze, Tuke - a Mephistopheles look-alike on the side of the law - unearths some curious facts about a very strange family; a bitter conflict over an unconventional legacy: a Victorian skeleton in the family closet; a short story entitled ""Too Many Cousins"" - inexplicably withdrawn from publication that reportedly predicted the precipitous decline in the family population; and Uncle Martin, a black sheep who refuses to remain dead.  Along a trail laid with suspense and more surprises than a conjurer's act, the author, a noted historian of his day and master of a captivatingly witty style, provides us with a fascinating picture of bomb-shattered London and the effects of war and profound social change on an England in transition. With something for everyone, this devilish tale, one of the most charming and challenging detective stories of postwar England - or any time - will keep you guessing until the last page.

Now, in her sophisticated and provocative story collection Spoiled, Macy turns her unsparing eye on affluent and educated women who nevertheless struggle to keep their footing in their relationships and life.In ""Annabel's Mother,"" a young woman does a good deed for her nanny, only to have it go horribly wrong. ""Bait and Switch"" chronicles a lifelong rivalry between two sisters. A self-made woman struggles to gain the upper hand with her comically self-assured cleaning woman in ""The Red Coat."" And in ""Taroudant,"" a newly married woman desperate for authentic experience makes a rash decision to leave the grounds of her Moroccan luxury hotel. Macy's voice is as straightforward as it is original in these stories, and her characters deftly nuanced. Full of surprising, sometimes shocking insights and simmering with outrage, compassion, and humor, Spoiled is a remarkable collection from a boldly talented writer.From the Hardcover edition.

Anne Tyler hailed Mason as 'a full-fledged master of the short story.' Mason's work, charged with a spirit of exploration, garnered both popular and critical acclaim. This reader collects outstanding examples of Mason's award-winning work from throughout her writing career and provides a unique look at the development of one of the country's finest writers. Patchwork contains short stories first published in the New Yorker and other leading periodicals; chapters from Mason's acclaimed novels, including In Country, An Atomic Romance, and The Girl in the Blue Beret; and riveting excerpts from Mason's eclectic nonfiction. Some examples of Mason's recent explorations in flash fiction appear here in print for the first time. Mason's writing glows with a nuanced understanding of the struggles and pathos of American life in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. George Saunders writes in his introduction, ""Bobbie Ann Mason is a strange and beautiful writer. . . . Her stories exist to gently touch on, and praise, even mourn, what it feels like to be alive in this moment."" Patchwork conveys Mason's extraordinary talent and range as a writer""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These ten interconnected short stories, which take place in China and the United States over a thirty-year period, merge to paint a nuanced portrait of family life, full of pain, surprises, and subtle acts of courage. Richly textured narratives from the mother, the father, the son, and the daughters play out against the backdrop of China's social and economic change. With quiet humor and insight into the ordinary, Yang Huang writes of a father who spanks his son out of love; a brother who betrays his sister; and a woman who returns to China after many years to find her country changed in ways both expected and startling.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Written when Chang was still in her twenties, these stories combine a contemporary sensibility, keenly alert to sexual politics and psychological ambiguity, with a lyricism that echoes the classics of Chinese literature.

But lets face it: the Bible always needed punching up. Plus, it raised quite a few questions that a modern world refuses to ignore any longer: wouldnt it be boring to live inside a whale? How did Joseph explain Marys pregnancy to the guys at work? Who exactly was the megalomaniacal foreman who oversaw the construction of the Tower of Babel? And honestly, what was Cains problem?In Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bible!, Jonathan Goldstein re-imagines and recasts the Bibles greatest heroes with depth, wit, and snappy dialogue. This is the Bible populated by angry loners, hypochondriacs, and reluctant prophets who fear for their sanity. Basically, a Bible that readers can finally, genuinely relate to.

In ""The Christmas Ghost,"" a boy delivering a dinner pail to his factory foreman father sees an apparition; his father scoffs, but the boy's willingness to believe his own vision averts a full-scale catastrophe. ""The Christmas Cat,"" set, like the other story, in England between the wars, an upper-class 11-year-old spends Christmas with her bachelor uncle, and his small-minded, mean-spirited housekeeper. The Carnegie Medal-winning author can be trusted not to overdo the sentiment and, like a good gingerbread, both tales have sweetness, spice and bite. Ages 8-up.

As is to be expected, they are all set during the holiday season; however, the focus on the seasonal festivities ranges from totally integrated, as in the case of Mary Balogh's ""The Best Gift,"" to somewhat peripheral, as in Sheila Walsh's ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear."" Included also are stories by Emma Lange, Sandra Heath, and Emily Hendrickson.

But their characters are universally recognizable and utterly compelling, whether they are ex-pats in Africa, migrant workers crossing the Mexican border, Armenian immigrants on the rough streets of East Hollywood, or pioneers in nineteenth-century Idaho. Accompanying the stories are the editor's introduction, essays from the eminent jurors on their favorite stories, observations from the winning writers on what inspired them, and an extensive resource list of magazines""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Mouvant et polymorphe, ce format relève aussi bien de l'art que de la littérature, des sciences de la communication, du cinéma, de l'audiovisuel et de nombreux autres domaines. Il n'a pour autant fait l'objet que d'un petit nombre de publications interdisciplinaires. En confrontant les approches et les objets et en observant points communs et différences, il est toutefois possible d'en cerner les contours et d'en identifier les grandes lignes, qui ont à voir avec les notions de court, d'éphémère, de simple, de concis, de dense, voire d'inachevé, sans se confondre avec elles. Les textes rassemblés ici selon une perspective interdisciplinaire et internationale envisagent donc les formes brèves dans leur diversité, d'un point de vue diachronique tout autant que synchronique. Ils permettent de nourrir non seulement des analyses ciblées sur ces différents types de formes brèves (au cinéma, en littérature, dans l'art, dans la communication, etc.), mais aussi une réflexion théorique sur les questions de définitions, les enjeux, la modernité, ou encore sur la transgénéricité et la transmédialité qui caractérisent souvent ces formes brèves.""--Page 4 of cover.
