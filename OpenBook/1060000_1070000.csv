But their central concern surrounds the complex life and death of a mother, and attendant mourning for her. Trust and doubt coexist in these pages, and the natural world offers solace but never complete reassurance: 'How vain to seek certainty,' Kildegaard writes. Indeed, the book ends with a poem comprised of spacious questions.

Titel,Freda Kamphuis,poetry,First published in 2014,/works/OL31712581W,/authors/OL11534098A/Freda_Kamphuis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Voetnoot|Language Dutch|Pages 61,"Dit is de tweede bundel van Freda Kamphuis die bij Voetnoot verschijnt en deel 20 in de reeks 'Eigentijdse Poëzie'. Een vast onderdeel van Freda's poëzie is de haiku: drie regels van vijf, zeven en vijf lettergrepen. Maar waar de klassieke haiku over een ervaring of de registratie van een moment gaat, gaan Freda's haiku's vooral over zichzelf. Ze maakt van de strenge vormbeperking een inspiratiebron. 0Een ander vast element wordt gevormd door zogenoemde 'visuele' gedichten, waarbij de vorm wordt bepaald door de inhoud. Die kruisbestuiving van vorm en inhoud komt in Freda's bundel overal terug - om te beginnen in de titel, die 'TITEL' luidt. De titel verwijst naar zichzelf, waardoor allerlei lagen van een titel - de betekenis, het woordbeeld, de functie ervan - samenvallen.

Je me murmure le Supreme    (Sous le dome du coeur s'allument les miroirs):    l""Obscur et l'Etoile, l""Ineffable""  The allusion here is about the remembrance of the different epiphanies of God (The Supremem); remembrance taken as the doorway to the Prophet's Way of spiritual realization (Peace Upon Him).

Elle se propose implicitement (avec Yonnet de Metz et la Vengeance Fromondin) comme l'une des conclusions possibles de la Geste des Loherains, mais elle n'en respecte nullement l'intention, puisque les Lorrains y sont menés à leur perte. Œuvre d'un poète cultivé bien au fait des exigences formelles de la chanson de geste, elle intègre quelques développements non épiques (enchanteurs, légende du Bois de la Croix, etc.) -- et laisse transparaître des intentions politiques en donnant la part belle au comte de Flandre et aux seigneurs du Nord au détriment du roi de France et des Lorrains.""--Provided by publisher.

While poets continue to experiment, the contemporary tanka in English may be described as typically an untitled free-verse short poem having anywhere from about twelve to thirty-one syllables arranged in words and phrases over five lines, crafted to stand alone as a unitary, aesthetic whole - a complete poem. Excepting those written in a minimalist style, a tanka is about two breaths in length when read aloud. During the last thirty years, it has emerged as a robust short form that is identifiable as a distinct verse type while being extremely variable in its details.""--BOOK JACKET.

They speak of, or rather from, a Japan of the imagination and the American South in sweet and sure androgynous tones. His book will make you laugh while the poems go about their business of printing after-images on your memory.”    —William Corbett  “Gander writes a cool, detached poetry, never confessional or autobiographical…There’s a toughness, a hard edge of danger on the margins of these poems. Gander has a startling way of yoking beauty and violence…”    —The Providence Sunday Journal  “Gander writes with a fascinating opaqueness; his metaphors and narrative touches twist strangely on the page, seem to reflect light back into the reader’s eyes… The Japanese influence that weaves through the poems adds to their opaque, alien quality. But the eccentricities in Rush To The Lake aren’t cross-national or cross-cultural; they inhere in the queer, lyrical properties of Gander’s own mind…I very much like Rush To The Lake.”    —Poetry Flash   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Most commonly it stems from not being where we think we should be. Not feeling as though we have progressed in our career after so many failed attempts stings the most. We all want the benefits of success, but we have to be willing to pay the costs. Pursuing your dream is a praiseworthy endeavor, but is it worth the heartache that comes with trying to achieve it? This inspiring collection of poems and quotes helps you decide what matters most to you and spurs you to keep going wholeheartedly, however long it takes. It also weaves in testimonies from a wide variety of young adults, whose life experiences realistically illustrate the power of hope and determination. Rather than ignore the pain or be overwhelmed by it, discover how to make room for it so you can press on to fulfill your purpose as you grow into a person who not only dreams, but achieves. If you can't move that mountain, climb it--you may be closer to summiting than you think.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the Confederate Dead,Kevin Young,poetry,First published in 2007,/works/OL6554348W?edition=ia%3Aforconfederatede0000youn,/authors/OL1755908A/Kevin_Young,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9700830M-M.jpg,"Publish Date January 9, 2007|Publisher  Knopf|Language English|Pages 156","In this passionate new collection, Kevin Young takes up a range of African American griefs and passages. He opens with the beautiful “Elegy for Miss Brooks,” invoking Gwendolyn Brooks, who died in 2000, and who makes a perfect muse for the volume: “What the devil / are we without you?” he asks. “I tuck your voice, laced / tight, in these brown shoes.” In that spirit of intimate community, Young gives us a saucy ballad of Jim Crow, a poem about Lionel Hampton's last concert in Paris, an “African Elegy,” which addresses the tragic loss of a close friend in conjunction with the first anniversary of 9/11, and a series entitled “Americana,” in which we encounter a clutch of mythical southern towns, such as East Jesus (“The South knows ruin & likes it / thataway―the barns becoming / earth again, leaning in―”) and West Hell (“Sin, thy name is this / wait―this place― / a long ways from Here / to There”).  For the Confederate Dead finds Young, more than ever before, in a poetic space that is at once public and personal. In the marvelous “Guernica,” Young’s account of a journey through Spain blends with the news of an American lynching, prompting him to ask, “Precious South, / must I save you, / or myself?” In this surprising book, the poet manages to do a bit of both, embracing the contradictions of our “Confederate” legacy and the troubled nation where that legacy still lingers.

In the circuitry of her illuminated, incongruous, but somehow perfectly apt details, 'the alien befits us.' With a nod to Gertrude Stein and Fernando Pessoa, as well as cameos by Frida Kahlo, Maya Deren, and Claude Cahun, Amy celebrates 'the roles' of women even as she redefines them, telling us: 'I put on my long black dream/to live among my female brothers.' Playful, provocative, and frenetically lyrical, this is metamorphic poetry for our times—Elaine Equi.  ""'We are not / a great many things, while in fact we are the functions / of those things, and without them, / we are less and more than ever.' You see, there's an underbelly that needs to be got to, and I'm the Man Who Loves You is all about it. Each detail in an Amy King poem seems a world in itself. & it's not like you've never seen details like these. & it's not like you have either""—Rod Smith.

As Louise Glück observes in her foreword, “Green Squall begins and ends in the garden”; however, Hopler’s gardens are not of the seasonal variety evoked by poets of the English lyric—his gardens flourish at lower, fiercer latitudes and in altogether different mindscapes. There is a darkness in Hopler’s work as deep and brutal as any in American poetry. Though his verbal extravagance and formal invention bring to mind Wallace Stevens’s tropical extrapolations, there lies beneath Green Squall’s lush tropical surfaces a terrifying world in which nightmare and celebration are indistinguishable, and hope is synonymous with despair.

In Liquid Love and Other Longings, poet and writer Norman G. Kester bares his soul and paints amour passionately, examining the powerful influence of the sea on life and love. Desire runs deep like flaming rivers of fire and death. In pleasureful and painful love poems that are haunting and astonishing in depth, power and language, Mr. Kester's sea of longing is a philosophical exploration of love and a metaphor for his native South Africa. His writing speaks boldly of the continuing impact of colonialism. Written in an age of uncertainty yet hope, Liquid Love and Other Longings is a delicate work of the heart. It is rich in memory and meaning, weaving intricate lives from sea to shore, from people to people and probes the vibrancy and uniqueness of race, identity, exile and nationhood within a new century of creative possibility.

What can be known, through poetry, about a history that remains silenced? And what are the forces shaping an American life in the 21st century? Car accidents, patriarchy, television, and media fall under this poet's gaze, along with the intergenerational reverberations of historical trauma. As with The Palace of Contemplating Departure, Saito's first award-winning collection, Power Made Us Swoon, strives for wonder, and speaks--in edgy and vulnerable tones--of the fraught journey toward a more just world. ""Learn to lie to survive, "" sings the woman warrior, speaking on the themes of resiliency and survival. ""Learn to outlast the flame / learn the art of surprise.""""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here a master writes at top form, back-dropped by life's curious moments and imagining Jesus as an untidy roommate or considering our final destination in ""Beginner's Guide to Death.""""After the Point of No Return""After that moment when you've lost all reason for going back where you started, when going ahead is no longer a Yes or No, but a matter of fact, you'll need to weigh, on the one hand, what will seem, on the other, almost nothing against something  slightly more than nothing and must choose again and again, at points of fewer and fewer chances to guess, when and which way to turn.That's when you might stop thinking about stars and storm clouds, the direction of wind, the difference between rain and snow, the time  of day or the lay of the land, about which trees mean water, which birds know what you need to know before it's too late, or what's right here under your feet, no longer able to tell you  where it was you thought you had to go.David Wagoner is the author of two dozen books of poetry and ten novels.

Punch. is a book about work, about the will that rises and the dust that falls. It is about being lost, hungry, and hopeless, creeping toward the pipelines in a 78 Buick Regal with Big Star on the radio. Sometimes angry, sometimes darkly funny, these lean and muscular poems explore the world of punching in and punching out, the punch-drunk and the sucker-punched. Whether the poems are tightened by the rhythm of a hard hand, or the lines sprawl across the page with swagger, there is real music here. Brute voices, contemplative and haunting, speak to us with unwavering self-conflict and salty confidence. In these poems, life is a struggle and the end is already written, but there's something deeply moving about the resilience and resistance of these voices: Lunch won't be here / for another hour, one says, so when the rain / comes, it is welcome.  ""Former Poet Laureate, Philip Levine once said we write what we are given. Just as Levine was given industrial Detroit and James Wright was given rural Ohio, Ray McManus was given an American South where 'Every day is the bottom of a bucket. Every day is slide guitar,' where 'blistered hands, hearts, and tongues, give way to callus, the need to alter, to repair.' What Ray McManus has given us in return is Punch.: a tough, tenderhearted, phenomenal work about work. These are poems of lucid witness. Let us give thanks.""  —Terrance Hayes, National Book Award winner for Lighthead  ""'Addition is easy,' McManus writes, and he means money in a day-worker's pocket, a lonesome man meeting his lover in an empty parking lot, the handful of bent nails a carpenter can't use, he means the grease and gears and rust and sweat and spit of a working-class life. This is a collection of poems written in the spirit of Levine's What Work Is, whose song is all hard knocks and hard-won knowledge. Its sections are named after blue-collar works shifts, which is fitting--as Punch does the important work of honoring first shifts, swing shifts, graveyard shifts, and hours and days off between them.""  —Dorianne Laux, author of The Book of Men   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pardlo’s obsession is the impossibility of fully capturing the image, and the larger question of the role of the New World writer and his relationship to history, marginalization and the politics of representation. How does one defy the tradition that he loves? Pardlo’s choice is to expand it, to take his cues from jazz musicians, those incorrigible reinventors and reshapers of meaning and expectation. Totem is an assured debut by a writer who claims a wider territory—the world beyond the Bantu Stands of ""the urban""—a writer who knows it, who understands it and loves it, and that is why he defies it, to keep it honest, to keep it whole.

It brought Edgar Allan Poe, then in his mid-30s and a well-known poet, critic, and short story writer, his first taste of celebrity on a grand scale. ""The Raven"" remains Poe's best-known work, yet it is only one of a dazzling series of poems and stories that won him an enduring place in world literature.  This volume contains ""The Raven"" and 40 others of Edgar Allan Poe's most memorable poems, among them ""The Bells,"" ""Ulalume,"" ""Israfel,"" ""To Helen,"" ""The Conqueror Worm,"" ""Eldorado,"" and ""Annabel Lee."" Together they reveal the extraordinary spectrum of Poe's personality — his idealism; his visionary qualities; his responsiveness to beauty, to love, and to women; and his susceptibility to the eerie and the morbid. They reveal, too, his virtuoso command of poetic language, rhythms, and figures of speech — command that would make his one of the most distinctive voices in all of poetry.A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.    --back cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door — Only this and nothing more."""". Those sonorous and somber words of Edgar Allan Poe that begin The Raven are part of most everyone's fond educational memories. Beautiful and haunting to hear and even more fun to read aloud. In this recording I have just attempted to express my enjoyment of the beauty in some favorite Poe poems. Beside The Raven, there are Alone; A Dream Within A Dream; Annabel Lee; City In the Sea; The Bells; A Dream Within a Dream; Annabel Lee; Dreamland; Evening Star; Lenore; Eldorado; A Valentine and ""The Happiest Day"". Hopefully listeners will enjoy hearing them half as much as I enjoyed the selfish pleasure of recording them.

In this collection of forty-eight poems by Edgar Allan Poe we will go through a wide variety of themes, from horror and raw creepiness in ""The Raven"" to pure love in ""A Valentine"" to depression in ""Alone."" Throughout all of his poems Poe kept a very strong meter and rhyme scheme. This is most obvious in ""The Bells.""

"Ovid, Amores (Book 1)",William Turpin,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20930528W,/authors/OL8011746A/William_Turpin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 266,"""From Catullus to Horace, the tradition of Latin erotic poetry produced works of literature which are still read throughout the world. Ovid?s Amores, written in the first century BC, is arguably the best-known and most popular collection in this tradition. This book contain embedded audio files of the original text read aloud by Aleksandra Szypowska. Born in 43 BC, Ovid was educated in Rome in preparation for a career in public services before finding his calling as a poet. He may have begun writing his Amores as early as 25 BC. Although influenced by poets such as Catullus, Ovid demonstrates a much greater awareness of the funny side of love than any of his predecessors. The Amores is a collection of romantic poems centered on the poet?s own complicated love life: he is involved with a woman, Corinna, who is sometimes unobtainable, sometimes compliant, and often difficult and domineering. Whether as a literary trope, or perhaps merely as a human response to the problems of love in the real world, the principal focus of these poems is the poet himself, and his failures, foolishness, and delusions.    By the time he was in his forties, Ovid was Rome?s most important living poet; his Metamorphoses, a kaleidoscopic epic poem about love and hatred among the gods and mortals, is one of the most admired and influential books of all time. In AD 8, Ovid was exiled by Augustus to Romania, for reasons that remain obscure. He died there in AD 17.    The Amores were originally published in five books, but reissued around 1 AD in their current three-book form. This edition of the first book of the collection contains the complete Latin text of Book 1, along with commentary, notes and full vocabulary. Both entertaining and thought-provoking, this book will provide an invaluable aid to students of Latin and general readers alike.""

Tom Pow sets out to explore what this means in some of the most rapidly vanishing areas of Europe. From Spain to Russia, he uses the tools of his trade--travelogue, essay, story and poem--to make connections, not only with what he encounters in numerous dying villages, but to reflect on his own experiences of memory, identity and loss. In Another World is an open book: not an argument, but an invitation to remember, to reflect and to engage with one of the most significant social issues affecting Europe today.

Even the best dreams recall happiness that cannot be retrieved, while the worst memories bend past love into a crazy line through darkness: ""Anything can turn furious. The crazy / line through wreckage that wears my face and all / the faces seems not to end. And on the way, / even the most damaged things have one / surface glazed, a sudden distorting mirror / that I can’t help finding. There, I look as I did / stalled in hours or places it is shame / to remember. The Eumenides are slow / vengeance, meted out by anywhere love fails / in the collapse and angry dealing of self-love. / The light presses. The air presses hard and no / story of mine if good enough to hold out.""  When there is escape, calm in these poems it is often in thoughts of distant lands and pasts, in the works of other writers and artists—the bands of light and changing shadows of Cezanne’s canvases, the suburban desire and deep green lawns of Cheever’s fiction. It is art, stories, the urge to tell that brings hope in these lines.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Este libro es un homenaje a su personalidad y a la importancia cobrada por su colección de poesía en la cultura española e hispanoamericana. Iniciada en 1969 como respuesta a un panorama editorial empobrecido y difícil para la lírica, la Colección Visor de Poesía ha acompañado con voluntad plural la evolución del género a través de las fronteras, los cambios históricos, las generaciones literarias y las diferencias estéticas. Si un catálogo es la obra personal y creativa de un editor literario, Visor condensa bien la apuesta de Jesús García Sánchez por una poesía llena de matices, abierta, rigurosa y capaz de llegar a los lectores. Cada uno de sus libros es un acto de fe en el valor y la vigencia de la poesía. Como demuestran las colaboraciones de Ojo a Visor, su colección forma parte de la cultura literaria y la educación sentimental de numerosos poetas, narradores y ensayistas.""--Back cover.

""All the poems in this collection,"" she writes, ""describe the ongoing process of discovering beauty and acquiring an aesthetic sensibility via food"" seeing and savoring it, cooking and sharing it, reaching out to all creation and drawing it in, devouring it, lapping it up, literally becoming one with it. In the title poem, chosen by Adrienne Rich for inclusion in Best American Poetry, the poet recalls an early memory of delight in pure color ""Red stains on a clean white bib. . . crimson blood on canvas."" Blood and crisp cotton as ink and paper, bread and wine as flesh and blood, the meal as art and as sacrament this is the stuff of The Butcher's Apron, a feast for lovers of good food and good poetry, and for those who, ""as some women love jewels, love the jewels of life.""

S. Merwin. The book is an intriguing set of variations on the theme of identity. Arnold plays on the idea of the shell as both the dazzling surface of the self and a hard case that protects the self against the assaults of the world. His poems narrate amatory and culinary misadventures. “Friendships based on food,” Arnold writes, “are rarely stable”—this book is full of wildly unstable and bewitching friendships and other significant relations.

Intricate in form but modern and tawdry in diction, Advice for Lovers walks a fine line between the anything-goes orthography of the Elizabethans and the shifting etymologies of Finnegans Wake. With the inclusion of trans- and third-gender pronouns, the work also argues for a proliferation of pronouns beyond a gendered dichotomy. Divided into two sections, ""Advices"" and ""Nudisms,"" the book dispenses wisdom on timeless topics of love like ""How to Transfigure the Body Utterly,"" ""What to Do When the Muse Becomes Your Lover,"" and even ""How to Leave Your Lover."" Yet in the midst of its classical splendor we encounter more contemporary figures like Johnny Cash, Ricky Martin, and Jack Spicer. Sexy, kinky, disquieting, Advice for Lovers blazes an erotic trail into the 21st century.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In these unhermetic poems, pop culture and the sacred go hand in hand. As Matthew Dickman said in an interview, he wants the “people from the community that I come from”—a blue-collar neighborhood in Portland, Oregon—to get his poems. “Also, I decided to include anything I wanted in my poems. . . . Pepsi, McDonald’s, the word ‘ass.’”  *There is no one to save us    because there is no need to be saved.    I’ve hurt you. I’ve loved you. I’ve mowed    the front yard. When the stranger wearing a sheer white dress    covered in a million beads    slinks toward me like an over-sexed chandelier suddenly come to life,    I take her hand in mine. I spin her out    and bring her in. This is the almond grove    in the dark slow dance.    It is what we should be doing right now.

Common Wealth: Contemporary Poets on Pennsylvania,Jerry Wemple,poetry,First published in 2005,/works/OL15662559W,/authors/OL1609099A/Jerry_Wemple,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24595374M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Penn State University Press|Language English,"Over the years, Pennsylvania has been graced with an abundance of writers whose work draws imaginatively on the state s history and culture. Common Wealth sings the essence of Pennsylvania through contemporary poetry. Whether Pennsylvania is their point of origin or their destination, the featured poets ultimately find what matters: heritage, pride, work, inventiveness, struggle, faith, beauty, hope.  Keystone poets Marjorie Maddox and Jerry Wemple celebrate Pennsylvania with this wide range of new and veteran poets, including former state poet Samuel Hazo, National Book Award winner Gerald Stern, Pulitzer Prize winners Maxine Kumin, W. S. Merwin, and W. D. Snodgrass, and Reading-born master John Updike. The book s 103 poets also include such noted authors as Diane Ackerman, Maggie Anderson, Jan Beatty, Robin Becker, Jim Daniels, Toi Derricotte, Gary Fincke, Harry Humes, Julia Kasdorf, Ed Ochester, Jay Parini, Len Roberts, Sonia Sanchez, Betsy Sholl, and Judith Vollmer.  In these pages, poems sketch the landscapes and cultural terrain of the state, delving into the history, traditions, and people of Philadelphia, Dutch country, the coal-mining region, the Poconos, and the Lehigh Valley; the Three Rivers region; the Laurel Highlands; and Erie and the Allegheny National Forest. Theirs is a complex narrative cultivated for centuries in coal mines, kitchens, elevated trains, and hometowns, a tale that illuminates the sanctity of the commonplace the daily chores of a Mennonite housewife, a polka dance in Coaldale, the late shift at a steel factory, the macadam of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  With its panoramic vision of Pennsylvania, its culture, and its thriving literary heritage, Common Wealth is a collection of remembrance for a state that continues to inspire countless contributions to American literature.

The embodiment of different voices is a moment of true empathy, as the author moves beyond his or her own margins to fully inhabit the character, personality, and mindset of another human being. While there are a great number of poems written in persona, there are no current anthologies that collect and celebrate the diverse writers who work in this mode today. Stacey Lynn Brown and Oliver de la Paz have selected a superb collection of approximately two hundred persona poems. These poems embody characters from popular culture, history, the Bible, literature, mythology, and their diversity is reflective of the wide range of authors working in this genre. The anthology also contains brief explanatory notes written by the poets to help historicize and contextualize their characters and personae""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Kasischke handles these earthly subjects adeptly even while making visionary leaps.""—Stephen Burt, Lingua Franca  ""Kasischke's breathless and disjunctive rhetoric becomes the stuff of a frightened and exuberant intelligence, sometimes rapturous, sometimes crazed, but more often than not deceptively canny in its ostensible abandon, its sentence fractures and strange pairings. . . .

But in addressing these topics, Laura Kasischke finds and reveals the strangeness of the most common traditions and dilemmas. These are poems that work to fuse reality and dream, life and death, logic and illogic. Kasischke precisely renders the experience we have of ourselves as physical and time-bound beings existing in a psychological and spiritual realm that seems to have no barriers or laws. The poems in this collection are both narrative and lyric, grounded in reality but also surreal, at once fully realized and merely hinting at what might be.

When denizens of the 22nd century, if we get there, look back on our era and ask how we lived, they will take an interest both in the strangest personalities who gave their concerns verbal form, and in the most representative. The future will not—should not—see us by one poet alone. But if there is any justice in that future, Kasischke is one of the poets it will choose.” —Boston Review  “Kasichke’s poems are powered by a skillful use of imagery and the subtle, ingenious way she turns a phrase.” —Austin American-Statesman  Laura Kasischke in her own words: ""I realized while ordering and selecting the poems for this collection that much of my more recent work concerns body parts, dresses, and beauty queens. These weren't conscious decisions, just the things that found their way into my poems at this particular point in my life, and which seem to have attached to them a kind of prophetic potential. The beauty queens especially seemed to crowd in on me, in all their feminine loveliness and distress, wearing their physical and psychological finery, bearing what body parts had been allotted to them. For some time, I had been thinking about beauty queens like Miss Michigan, but also the Rhubarb Queen, and the Beauty Queens of abstraction—congeniality. And then—Brevity, Consolation for Emotional Damages, Estrogen—all these feminine possibilities to which I thought a voice needed to be given.""

The same verbal playfulness and prophetic lyricism that made Revell a 1992 Guggenheim Fellow in Poetry and a winner of National Poetry Series, Pushcart, and PEN Center USA West awards are in full force in Beautiful Shirt. Here he traverses the rocky terrain of innocence, memory, disillusion, and salvation in a voice at once haunted and elliptical: “This is the world as I have known it./ It has a soft outline and is easily victimized.”  Juxtaposed within a trio of long, introspective poems are shorter lyrics that push the limits of poetic syntaxes and dictions. In all, Beautiful Shirt searches for the true nature of the self through language unfettered by narrative constraints and conventional conceptual identities.  from Google Books   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The broad theme of Samaras's poems is the connection between eternal things and the passing world, between our sense of exile and our sense of commonality. Equilibrium between these worlds is achieved only through human feeling, through language. Samaras examines the commonality of experience in diverse international settings—from Byzantium to the cathedrals of technology in the modern cities of America. His language extols the primary delight and purpose of poetry: the music and inventiveness of language, wholly new and transformed, language that is both ancient and modern. Through an intensely personal and visual approach, these poems reveal our lives to us for time to come.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Trust him; his poems will take you on profound journeys.”    —Booklist  “Frank Gaspar’s poems are agile and forceful, their narratives clear and absorbing. In them he is speaking to the reader—but also to himself, or perhaps to some hazy divinity, or to the blue sky. I felt in his voice no attempt to persuade me of anything. I felt only the abiding imperative to get it right. Which is, of course, what real writing is all about.”    —Mary Oliver  “No one in America writes as Frank Gaspar does. His poetic voice is distinctive. His poems mutter and fuss in the tone of the sage awake and singing through the night to worry, as we do, the state of the soul in contemporary life. Father, lover, scholar, friend, and poet, he speaks for us as no one else can. And I for one am grateful for this fabulous book.”    —Hilda Raz  “Any book that begins with a poem titled ‘I Go Out for a Smoke and Become Mistaken for the Archangel’ and ends on the sentence ‘And so I kicked and kicked’ is bound to contain grand evolutions, and Gaspar delivers. The path he so often weaves—from questions, through catalog of pathetic fallacies, to abstracted answers—can be a stunning rhetorical tapestry….Gorgeous.”    —Provincetown Arts   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Karen McCarthy Wolf noted in Speak from Here to There, a ""warmth...in the correspondence...between a black man almost but not quite marooned in the white of America's Midwest, and a white man negotiating his own exile from the vast physical and historical dissonance of Western Australia"". In A New Beginning that initial dialogue is taken to new depths of trust, exposure and intimacy, to new themes and concerns. Dawes' and Kinsella's voices are utterly distinctive, but one also hears new notes as they respond to each other's investigations of the craft of poetic form.""

Cort Day’s is one such voice, and The Chime, with its concise, persuasive ten-line poems, offers a world and a mind resonant with wit and music.”    —The Antioch Review  “In The Chime, Cort Day has assembled a book-length series of rich and imaginative, ten-line, block-text poems. Day’s poetry functions much like a shoebox diorama: it relies on captivating detail, shadow and the suggestion of character to transcend the physical limitations of form. Should you doubt it, there’s great beauty in smallness, and a great and compelling strangeness to The Chime.”    —American Letters and Commentary  “Cort Day dares to make a sound as complex, as immediate, as keen as its occasion. And the occasion is language moving through and moving with mortality. These poems are the vocable body of a vivid birth, and I welcome them.”    —Donald Revell  “With the prickly sensuality of thistle and the eccentric concentration of the miniaturist, Cort Day’s first book crafts a pixelated music — optical, word perfect, drop-dead arresting, and ultimately inenarrable. Against the desiccation of our most potent feelings, The Chime suicides and flowers; it grows a mind.”    —C. D. Wright  “In response to ‘the contingency of things,’ ‘the heart-stopped forest,’ the ‘toxic blue garden’ and the sheer uncanniness of the quotidian, Cort Day has produced a work of transgressive imaginings, calls and responses, chimes and echoes. It is a work by turns humorous and darkly erotic, where the ships of reason burn on an ocean tuned to an open frequency. That ocean is poetic speech, drowning the reality principle in its surges and its deeps.”    —Michael Palmer   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Taken another way, they both say the whole enterprise of finding truth through the poem is the reddest of herrings; simply the pleasure of the attempt makes it worth the price of admission.”    —H_NGM_N  “Polar is a carefully crafted book, comprised of four coherent sections, united not only in their themes of existential, melting intransigence, but also by the strength of Gibson’s undiluted voice. Although he has more than one trick up his sleeve, there is a pleasing consistency in the way Gibson crafts each line, as well as in the way one plainspoken short line follows another. His signature is the craftsmanlike progression of his clear images—the way that subtle assonance or internal rhyme leads the reader from one image to the next.”    —Slope  “The poems in  are anything but frozen; they reveal themselves and revel in their movement. In figures as elaborate and beautiful as frost, Dobby Gibson reinvents poetic argument, often as surprised and delighted by its own wild and energetic means as it is by its wild and sometimes mordant conclusions.”    —Dean Young “These poems are written by a true poet, someone in love with the world and mad at it too, and they are also written by a very particular poet, Dobby Gibson, who is madly in love with the other mysterious inner world each of us possesses and reveals when no one else is looking. ‘It may be true that everything / has already been said, / but it’s just as true that not everyone / has had a chance to say it.’ How can one not listen to the innards of a young poet who announces as much and then sets out, in his first book, to make it new?

These poems have as much courage as they do craft; the result is an indelible book which illuminates the way the living and the dead sustain an intimate conversation which death changes but cannot silence. This ferociously tender poet instructs us that to be fully alive is to be entirely haunted.”    —Mark Doty  “Richard McCann writes not about, but from, his losses. We listen to his ghosts and they are ours also.”    —Jean Valentine  “Ghost Letters reminds me of Rilke. To read these poems is to be frightened by exposure to our transparency and evanescence. It would be easy to say that these poems are about forbidden love, but the greater risk they take is the forbiddenness of feeling itself. In these reckless, beautifully written poems, the pilgrim instructs us, through example, that life and death are mutually contagious.”    —Tony Hoagland   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pennyweight Windows: New & Selected Poems,Donald Revell,poetry,First published in 2005,/works/OL1867648W?edition=ia%3Apennyweightwindo00reve,/authors/OL223605A/Donald_Revell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3298919M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Alice James Books|Language English|Pages 220,"“Donald Revell’s selected poems, Pennyweight Windows, contains some of the most interesting American poems written in the last twenty years. Revell at his best is a writer of unusual intellectual rigor and great lyrical poignancy: his mind is tuned to adages and axioms, pre-Socratic mind-tricks and the gnomic observations of Thoreau; but he has a big, vulnerable heart that tries to live in our world among our entanglements.” —Poetry  “The new poems, collected along with all the best of the old in Revell’s 2005 career-spanning volume, Pennyweight Windows: New & Selected Poems…remind me of James Wright, of music by the Postal Service and Low, of the most beautiful diary in the world: Its desert-burnished gems await you now.” —City Pages “2005 Artists of the Year” Issue  “To read this selection from Donald Revell’s 20-plus years of making poems is to witness the evolution of both an individual poet and the poetics of an entire era.” —Boston Review  “Pennyweight Windows heralds a major reclamation: the right of a poet to be sincere. Revell’s achievement is in his acceptance of the risks of that sincerety. And this is the refreshing fact of these poems, all of them, as different as they are in form across the twenty years of their writing: they make no excuses for us, even in their essential humanity. They discern honestly human barbarism. But over that, they discern and express beauty—in nature, in humanity, and, yes, in God and the human quest to understand him.” —Speakeasy  “It takes guts to write more poems about peace, war, God and children, but Revell’s are so fresh, it’s as if he’s the first person ever to do it.” —TIME Magazine  “For over twenty years, Donald Revell has used the pastoral as a tool of protest/revolution against violence and war and as a guide to peace, arguing for personal and political growth in precise, delicate lyrics. Includes a new group of poems, and much of the finest work from Revell’s eight previous collections. A major collection from “…an increasingly important poet for our times” (The Antioch Review). “Donald Revell’s spectacular new-and-selected amounts to three very good poetry books for the price of one—the first by a dejected urbanite who thinks he’s watching America, and his own private life, slowly collapse; one by a maker of puzzles, mazes, and spells; and one by an open-hearted, charitable, mystically inclined father, husband, and Christian believer who cherishes southern Nevada. I’d recommend any of those three on their own; the trio is irresistible.” —The Believer  “PW said last year that Revell was due for a career retrospective, and this ample and almost shockingly varied cull of poems from eight books rewards that call richly.” —Publishers Weekly   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I savor these poems for their craftsmanship, their emotional precision, and their abiding sense of the heart’s inner workings and mysteries.”    —Edward Hirsch  “For all the geography proposed in his poems—Houston, coastal Connecticut, Bayou Louisiana, San Francisco, Paris—and for all the years accounted for in the preparation of this his first book, Jeffrey Greene’s strong voice is resonantly of a piece and secured: located in a firm spiritual identity. Greene’s mode is to allow the detail, the moment, its own developing ignition, its own opportunity to fill out the figure. Many of these poems, in fact, are journey-narratives; stories that build their epiphanies out of the emotion pressure of a larger and immanent imaginative world, a world immediately around the poem, to the left of the worshiper.”    —Stanley Plumly   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These poems vividly depict the gaffer's terrain from the set of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, to Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon and The Wiz, to a lighting session with Lucille Ball. In these poems is the quest for identity and synchronicity within the imagined and experimental realm of light and cinema, and the immutable physical world where notions of gender, sex, desire, and ambition are prescribed a priori. the GAFFER deconstructs the idea of outsider as pioneer-then runs with it.

[His] poetry demonstrates that the pursuit of meaning in a cruel, absurd world is a powerful act of faith.”    —Library Journal  “Pennock’s poems exemplify Hugh Kenner’s dictum that ‘idiosyncrasy of language derives from attention.’ Here, Pennock proves that language can bridge the gap between cerebration and sensation. The focus of his lens shifts effortlessly from extreme close-up (‘the fractal / geometry of a seahorse tail’) to macrocosm (‘a numinous sphere / of concentric circles,’) and revels in the temptations of each perspective. ‘[L]ike a fishbowl / on a rocking chair,’ this marvelous debut collection overflows with vertigo, brinksmanship, gravity, and pure pleasure.”    —Monica Youn  “An array of marginalized, criminal, ashamed, hurt, and unwashed figures—dogs, hyenas, coyotes, Hephaestus, insomniacs, alcoholics, spurned lovers—stalk Pennock’s book, hell-bent on their anti-heroic journey. Part ghost-town carnival mid-way, replete with jokes and rope tricks, part Greek tragedy, part quotidian plumbing and domestic mire, part ardent lyricism and hope, Sudden Dog balances its cynicism with authentic, fully human dignity.”    —Lisa Russ Spaar  “‘It’s only America,’ writes Matthew Pennock. ‘We watch it unravel like a fourth act without direction.’ And so in Pennock’s fine first collection, we find a country of war and surveillance, an economy of boom and collapse and a consciousness built of fragments assembled, admired, broken again. Sudden Dog is a troubling, moving and memorable book, that returns—strangely and via estrangement—to love.”    —Mark Wunderlich   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

City life, shoreline, night, loss and its shadow, desire—these come to us through an intelligence fully attuned to metaphor’s striking shifts from sight to insight. This is lyric poetry at its best, fully accomplished, probing, deeply felt, with delicate wit and language—oh the language!—stunning enough to pass Miss Dickinson’s test.”    —Betsy Sholl  “The clear intensity of the visionary requires stillness, not high speeds. And there is a restlessness at the heart of such stillness that Bill Rasmovicz’s first book gets at more exquisitely—with a voice that can bear it—than any I’ve read in years. His surreal practices are humanizing faith-keepings with the metamorphic, the elemental, the actual.”    —William Olsen  “Incredibly moving and smart, this book is indeed a world in place of itself, and more, in place of the world we thought we knew.

Sure, one-sided ones, but with someone whose mind is so stuffed that every quip becomes a set of metaphors feeding into an Escher staircase that’s headed back to the opening of the poem in spite of racing away from it.”    —Beth Kanell, Kingdom Books  “David Kirby is the rare poet who juxtaposes humor and satire with a serious academic and classical knowledge without pandering exclusively to one or the other.

These elliptical and colloquial lyrics draw equally from parable, prayer, and elegy. Hesitating on the threshold between isolation and community, the poet focuses a distortingly accurate microscope on what matters in our lives. “. . .familial, humane, and loyal to the good people and the simple delights of this world.” —Publishers Weekly  “. . .The reader must learn to forfeit expectation and simply tune in, like listening to a koan…these poems generously reward the concentration their language demands. Waldor asks us to listen to the noisy world as he hears it, and he opens our ears.” —Boston Review  “What strange rooms and quirky music Waldor’s poems open onto. His vision proves to us that the imaginal and the rational share equal claims on perception. The heart/mind of this work spiritualizes the material and materializes the soul.” —Li-Young Lee  “Door to a Noisy Room has the darkness, glitter, and hardness of obsidian. In this work, the heat of the passions has cooled to an elemental simplicity. Like obsidian the poems have been polished into jewels or napped to the keenest blade. They are beautiful and they are sharp.” —Lynn Emanuel  “It’s such a delight when something catches you by surprise and makes you read on—and on.

These poems are ecstatic, musical prayers, finding God in the details as well as the void. Winter Tenor is a tightly wrought lyric exploration of the severities of farm life, where doom and grace are one.  “…a series of evocative meditations on what it is to live close to the earth, with wonder and humility, amidst the violent practicalities of farm life… Goodan sees the self in nature and vice versa.”    —The Kenyon Review Online  “In a series of untitled, haiku-spare poems, Kevin Goodan’s second collection Winter Tenor reads like an ode to nature…considering the appearance, the experience, from different angles.”    —Gently Read Literature   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Breathturn into Timestead: The Collected Later Poetry gathers the five final volumes of his life's work in a bilingual edition, translated and with commentary by the award-winning poet and translator Pierre Joris. This collection displays a mature writer at the height of his talents, following what Celan himself called the ""turn"" (die ""Wende"") of his work away from the lush, surreal metaphors of his earlier verse. Given ""the sinister events in its memory,"" Celan wrote, the language of poetry has to become ""more sober, more factual. 'grayer.'"" He abandoned the richer music of lyric poems, paring his compositions down to increase the accuracy of the language that now ""does not transfigure or render 'poetical'; it names, it posits, it tries to measure the area of the given and the possible."" In his need for an inhabitable post-Holocaust world that held the memory and anguish of that history, Celan experimented with a bold new poetics. Breathturn into Timestead reveals a poet undergoing one of the most profound artistic reinventions of the twentieth century--creating a poetry grounded in his painful personal history and the ravages of postwar Europe""--  ""A collection of the late poems of German-language poet Paul Celan""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Western Practice is a book that deserves attention for its rich intersections of projective acrobatics and coming-of-age memory-textures, conjuring the roar of the Pacific at every turn of the line.”    —Lisa Jarnot  “If twentiety century California artists established a tradition of speculative innovation, then Western Practice ushers visionary West Coast poetics into the twenty-first.  Motika’s ingenious ear renders place prosodic; his ‘baroque leaps’ tender a sprung rhythm that turns history into ‘a theory at map’s edge.’  The ‘mystic/gather’ of this music give Motika’s ambitious projective praxis visual beauty and structural rigor.  Open this book—’crawl inside & lie down against the future.'”    —Brian Teare  “How to approach a microtonal notation of a life?  Within a diverse field of spacing, Motika’s poem “Delusions Enclosures: On Harry Partch (1901-1974)” scores a biography of the sounds of words and phrases written by the composer himself in and among the poet’s own.  In a way, notes. And a fine debut.”    —Marjorie Welish  “. . .Western Practice is a vast poetic anthropology. . .Motika’s poems shed the trappings of the solipsistically subjective, producing an efflorescence of wonder about the world at large.”    —The Brooklyn Rail  “Motika’s writing looks and sounds different than his contemporaries’, yet there is no denying the way the light shines on these poems. . . .

After Fondane's death, the poetry might have been forgotten had not writers like E.M. Cioran kept the memory of the work alive, and in France today, Fondane's poetry is again widely available. This first American collection of Fondane's poetry includes his surrealist ""Cine-poems,"" philosophical meditations, and poems that, in their secular/mystical Judaism, confront the calamity--and imaginative triumph--of European Jewry. Poems included in this collection are translated by Mitch Abidor, Marianne Bailey, E.M.

In the Ghost-House Acquainted is extraordinary.”    —Mary Oliver, in her judge’s citation for the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award  “. . .laid-back, and yet elegantly formal poems…call to mind Robert Frost in their reflecting on the day-to-day details of a rural existence, both the drudgery of tasks like feeding livestock and the quiet meditations on nature.”    —Library Journal  “Goodan’s poems envision the world as a quiet haunting, reminding us of our place as the few alive in a world overflowing with the spent energy of the dead. He posits the natural world not as an idol to be worshipped, but as an essential vehicle for spiritual survival and transcendence. Death and loss have never been so full of hope as they are in In the Ghost House Acquainted.”    —The Adirondack Review  “It is rare to see a poet work so hard in the physical world—serious farm labor—and still catch a fleeting glimpse of the spirit. Kevin Goodan does this convincingly because his language is so precise and his mind knows when to jump and when to stand still. This is a remarkable book.”    —James Tate  “Kevin Goodan’s austere poems have an eye and ear trained on the holiness of commonplace details like ‘the darkness that comes after fire.’ We can take comfort in the fact that his address to the natural world is so unflinchingly direct, for these poems are bathed in alchemical light.”    —Peter Gizzi  “Kevin Goodan’s poems can arrive like dumptrucks of grief, crushing gravel and fauna, torching the place, sending ash across the landscape; others unfold quietly, with reverence, working like scripture, having a kind of religious hush to them. All of them are absolutely devoid of cynicism and flippancy. It’s a unique (and often startling) experience to read them.”    —Michael Earl Craig   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

In Granted, she explores a timeless theme—spiritual and romantic longing. In page after page, she wrestles with faith and hope, struggling to find peace by finding freedom from desire. In the process, she lures readers into a hidden place somewhere between intellect and silence.”    —The Christian Science Monitor  “. . .Mary Szybist’s most gorgeous stylistic accomplishment may be her quietest, the enactment of an unaffected aesthetic of modesty.”    —American Book Review  “. . .it is these small passages, these arrivals, which detail the inaccurate promises and chosen solitudes that give Granted its often unsettling brilliance.”    —New Orleans Review  “There is a liminal quality to the poems that make up Mary Szybist’s first book, Granted. They hover at the threshold of desire, moving back and forth between both spiritual and romantic ardor, between what has been granted and what has been taken for granted within the confines of love and faith. Tethered at the lip of “impossible longings,” Szybist encounters concurrent moments of ecstasy, sensuality, and cynicism in her relationships with the self, others, the world, and God.”    —Electronic Poetry Review  “This work is ruminative, speculative, and deeply felt….”    —Rain Taxi  “. . .the best of these 37 poems express an almost intimate relationship between the poet and the sacred….[Szybist] writes from her own perspective and that of Jesus Christ; his mother, Mary; and the Archangel Gabriel, making the book resemble a polyphonic hymn. Using fresh metaphors…Szybist examines spiritual states from longing to abandonment to ecstasy.”    —Library Journal  “…we see that it is her being, her soul, that flutters so desperately within, just as she is the thing beating its wings in the mouth of the world, of God—which may be a fair description of the poetic voice itself, or at least of Szybist’s, no less iridescent for its fragility.”    —The Boston Phoenix  “Mary Szybist’s poems are about religious and sexual longing and about suspicion of religious and sexual longing. They exist in, or move toward, the negative spaces, the luminous, maddening almost presences the objects of our deepest desires inhabit. She has a gift for music, a gift for aphorism, a gift for being haunted. This is serious work, so it is occasionally funny and sometimes strange and often beautiful. ‘Original research in language,’ Ezra Pound said the real thing was. This is it.”    —Robert Hass  “Mary Szybist’s great poetic gifts confront the limits of human compassion, delving into some of its agonized consequences. Her work’s ambition is the creation of a free human in the midst of the seemingly endless tetherings of desire. Great spiritual courage is sometimes almost inaudible. When one leans in to listen, it almost shocking to hear this gorgeous soul sing.    —Jorie Graham  “This is poetry of a rare fine delicacy. Its very modesty testifies to a great ambition—to overcome by the quietest of means.”    —Donald Justice   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Driven by the sounds of hip-hop and reimagined forms and structures, Wicker's explosive second bookis composed of poems at war with themselves, verses in which the poet questions his own faith in God, in hope, in the American Dream, and in himself.

Whether beguiling readers with glorious poetry or consoling them with prayers from fellow restless souls, Cousineau can relieve any insomniac's unease. From St. John of the Cross to Annie Dillard, Beethoven to The Song of Songs, this refreshingly insightful anthology soothes and inspires all who struggle through the dark of the night. These ""night thoughts"" vividly illustrate Alfred North Whitehead's liberating description of ""what we do without solitude"" and also evoke Henry David Thoreau's reverie, ""Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake."" The night writers in Cousineau's vesperal collection range from saints, poets, and shamans to astronomers and naturalists, and tells of ancient tales and shining passages from the most brilliant (albeit insomniac) writers of today. These poetic ponderances sing of the falling darkness, revel in dream-time, convey the ache of melancholy, conspire against sleeplessness, vanquish loneliness, contemplate the night sky, rhapsodize on love, and languorously greet the first rays of dawn. Notable night owls include Rabandranath Tagore, Mary Oliver, Manley Hopkins, Jorge Borges and William Blake""--  ""Be transported!

Cold pastoral,Rebecca Dunham,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL20055169W,/authors/OL7614883A/Rebecca_Dunham,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 70,"""A searing, urgent collection of poems that brings the lyric and documentary together in unparalleled ways-unmasking and examining the specter of manmade disaster. On September 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed eleven men and began what would become the largest oil spill ever in US waters. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, leading to a death toll that is still unconfirmed. And in April 2014, the Flint water crisis began, exposing thousands of people to lead-contaminated drinking water. This is the litany of our time-and these are the events that Rebecca Dunham traces, passionately and brilliantly, in Cold Pastoral. In poems that incorporate interviews and excerpts from government documents and other sources-poems that adopt the pastoral and elegiac traditions in a landscape where ""I can't see the bugs; I don't hear the birds""--Dunham invokes the poet as moral witness. ""I owe him,"" she writes of one man affected by the oil spill, ""must learn, at last, how to look."" This is the world she shows us, without sentiment and with hard-earned beauty: Oysters decimated by freshwater release. Tarballs floating in the Gulf of Mexico. A hungry mother and her children in a grocery store. Clouds of pesticides. Eleven men dead. A silent spring. Experimental and incisive, Cold Pastoral is a collection that reveals what poetry can-and, perhaps, should-be, reflecting ourselves and our world back with gorgeous clarity""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Other poems celebrate places and things he loved: the gifts of winter, dawn, a wall in Naples, an English hilltop, Andalusia. And he makes peace with Detroit: ""Slow learner that I am, it took me one night/to discover that rain in New York City/is just like rain in Detroit. It gets you wet.""

Within his breakneck hilarity, there is always some nod toward our own fleshy mortality, a small sigh of death. Giampietro’s unique brand of genius makes the world more glorious, uproarious, and lonesomely true.”    —Julianna Baggott  “The lines in these wise, funny, often startlingly sad poems nudge and jostle each other coltishly, and no wonder: they are the foals of Head and Heart, two mighty steeds to draw the reader’s chariot out of the well-trodden way and straight to poetry’s palace of gold, its realm of the blesséd.”    —David Kirby  “Giampietro spends some quality time here interrogating his own appealingly quixotic soul. And like the best performance artists, this dissection implicates his audience, asking us to thoroughly consider what it means to be a friend, lover or parent. Giampietro constructs these questions with exceptional heart and verbal glamour. I love this book. It puts the human back in being.”    —Erin Belieu   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pavol Janik, PhD., was born in 1956 in Bratislava, where he also studied film and television dramaturgy and scriptwriting at the Drama Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts (VSMU). He has worked at the Ministry of Culture (1983-87), in the media and in advertising. President of the Slovak Writers' Society (2003-07) and the Secretary-General of the SWS (1998-2003, 2007 - ). He has received a number of awards for his literary and advertising work both in his own country and abroad.  This virtuoso of Slovak literature, Pavol Janík, poet, dramatist, prose writer, translator, publicist and copywriter was born on 15. 10. 1956. His literary activities focus mainly on poetry. Even his first book of poems, which appeared a quarter of a century ago, attracted the attention of the leading authorities in Slovak literary circles. He presented himself as a plain-spoken poet with a spontaneous manner of poetic expression and an inclination for irony directed not only at others, but also at himself. This style has become typical of all his work, which in spite of its critical character has also acquired a humorous, even bizarre dimension. His manner of expression is becoming terse to the point of being aphoristic. It is thus perfectly natural that Pavol Janík's literary interests should come to embrace aphorisms founded on a shift of meaning in the form of puns. In his work he is gradually raising some very disturbing questions and pointing to serious problems concerning the further development of humankind, while all the time widening his range of themes and styles. Literary experts liken Janík's poetic virtuosity to that in the work of Miroslav Válek, while in the opinion of the Russian poet, translator and literary critic, Natalia Shvedova, Válek is more profound and Janík more inventive. He has translated in poetic form several collections of poetry and written works of drama with elements of the style of the Theatre of the Absurd. Pavol Janík's literary works have been published not only in Slovakia, but also in Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Macedonia, the Russian Federation, Serbia, South Korea, Ukraine, United Kingdom and the United States of America.

This volume, like the author's final book (The Angels of the Earth) was printed in the author's own handwritten script. Wilson wrote:  The changes of style in the script of    these poems were made to emphasize the    moods of the months. The shaded script    suggests the sombre days of winter.    The lettering used in August and    November is a symbol of meditation,    while the bolder style of script found    in the other months is symbolic of    their joy.

Perceptions of Horace,Maria Wyke,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL18679043W,/authors/OL539616A/Maria_Wyke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""Throughout his work, the Roman poet Horace displays many, sometimes conflicting, faces: these include dutiful son, expert lover, gentleman farmer, man about town, outsider, poet laureate, sharp satirist and measured moraliser. This book features a wide array of essays by an international team of scholars from a number of different academic disciplines, each one shedding new light on aspects of Horace's poetry and its later reception in literature, art and scholarship from antiquity to the present day. In particular, the collection seeks to investigate the fortunes of 'Horace' both as a literary personality and as a uniquely varied textual corpus of enormous importance to western culture. The poems shape an author to suit his poetic aims; readers reshape that author to suit their own aesthetic, social and political needs. Studying these various versions of Horace and their interaction illuminates the author, his poetry and his readers""--Provided by publisher.

The present volume, Available Surfaces, focuses on the art of making both poetry and music and on the concept of ""making"" as well. Hummer draws on childhood experiences (""A Length of Hemp Rope""), adult experiences (""Hotel California""), experiences as a poet (""Available Surfaces""), and experiences as an explorer of unworldly spaces (""The Hive,"" ""Brain Wave and the End of Science Fiction"").  Hummer has published ten volumes of poetry with presses including Louisiana State University Press and the University of Illinois Press. His work has appeared in two anthology volumes published by Simon & Schuster and Cengage and in two Pushcart Prize anthologies. He has edited the Kenyon Review, the Georgia Review, and the Cimarron Review, among other journals.  ""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Reflecting their variety of visions and styles, The Oxford Anthology of African-American Poetry aims to offer nothing less than a definitive literary portrait of a people.  Here are poems by writers as different as Paul Laurence Dunbar and W.E.B. Du Bois; Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes; Gwendolyn Brooks and Amiri Baraka; Rita Dove and Harryette Mullen; Yusef Komunyakaa and Nathaniel Mackey. Acclaimed as a biographer and editor, Arnold Rampersad groups these poems as meditations on key issues in black culture, including the idea of Africa; the South; slavery; protest and resistance; the black man, woman, and child; sexuality and love; music and religion; spirituality; death and transcendence.  With their often starkly contrasting visions and styles, these poets illuminate some of the more controversial and intimate aspects of the black American experience. Poetry here is not only or mainly a vehicle of protest but also an exploration of the complex and tender subtleties of black culture. One section offers tributes to celebrated leaders such as Sojourner Truth and Malcolm X, but many more reflect the heroism compelled by everyday black life. The variety of poetic forms and language captures the brilliant essence of English as mastered by black Americans dedicated to the art of poetry.  Loving and yet also honest and unsparing, The Oxford Anthology of African-American Poetry is for readers who treasure both poetry and the genius of black America.

Among the Musk Ox People,Mary Ruefle,poetry,First published in 2002,/works/OL17313327W?edition=ia%3Aisbn_9780887483721,/authors/OL458994A/Mary_Ruefle,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11264612M-M.jpg,"Publish Date March 1, 2002|Publisher  Carnegie Mellon University Press|Language English|Pages 88","The fast-moving, jittery poems in this fifth volume from the well-respected Ruefle (The Adamant) try hard to portray the world as her speaker really feels it: ""I want,"" she exclaims, ""to have an ecstatic relationship with life."" In fluently unpredictable free verse (mostly) and discursive poetic prose (on occasion), Ruefle's work can take in almost anything, the more unexpected the better: ""a line of laundry strung out over the Acropolis,"" ""wigs and temperatures and horoscopes,"" ""the moon in utero,"" drum majorettes, breast milk, the Book of Job and more. Her talent for producing the unexpected can be a weakness: some poems sound almost arbitrary in their choice of line breaks, emphases and endings, favoring individual phrases over the poems they make up. ""It is a scrappy place, this world,"" Ruefle writes in ""Cocktail Party,"" ""and people walk about, a series of prepositions displacing the nouns."" At her best, Ruefle combines surrealism, comedy and domestic pathos: ""You've been crying: your cheeks are a rasher of streaked bacon."" While she comes off as more personal, and more various, than her sometime collaborator Dean Young, her abrupt and entertaining style should please his readers, and she can tell jokes as good as his (""Ducks never acquire any knowledge because they will never shut up""). If this book's verbal fireworks sometimes fail to flare fully, Ruefle's more serious side continues to give her work depth and necessity. (Mar.) Forecast: With another book soon to be published in May by CavanKerry press, and Post Meridian (2000) still in circulation, Ruefle has been prolific of late. With some earlier books out of print, look for a selected next time around, and for attention to this book and its successor in literary reviews.

Imbued with a sense of wonder, Noftle’s meditations also explore the elements of the self that even science cannot quantify.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Many of these poems reveal — and revel in — the erotics of sight and the written word. It is both a cerebral and visceral pleasure to read a poet who brings so much to the page. Anyone who cares about the present — and future — of poetry should read this brilliant, groundbreaking book.”         Alice Fulton    “Matthew Hittinger’s The Erotic Postulate is a sophisticated examination of math’s most basic equation: 1 + 1 = 2, which he reconfigures as ‘your body yours,// my body mine, one next to one as two.’ Suddenly, the politics of desire–physical attraction, emotional distance, surrender, struggle, rejection–trouble the intimacy of any unit (a pair, a couple, a marriage) located on any plane (a wrestling mat, a dance floor, a bed). But in Hittinger’s vision, the intersection of separate entities isn’t limited to one body’s connection to another, it also charts human relationship to landscape, culture, and imagination. Curious and observant, The Erotic Postulate sparkles with wonder.”         Rigoberto González     Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Cailleach’s roots lie in pre-Christian Ireland, and stories of her relationship with that rugged landscape and culture still abound. Central to these narratives is the story of her love affair with a sea god. A large stone rests on the ridge overlooking Ballycrovane Harbour, and it is said to be the petrified body of the Cailleach; she has had several lives, beginning each life with a birth from her stony form – and returning to stone at the end.  The supernatural and superhuman feature strongly in traditional stories of the Cailleach (pronounced Ca-lock or Cay-luck) – feats such as her creating mountains or leaping vast distances that place the tales firmly into the world of myth. While still recognising the Cailleach as a figure of extraordinary power and influence, Leanne O’Sullivan’s poems explore the human origins from which the legend grew. She still forms the landscape, yet at the same time is intrinsically part of it, close to it, rather than gigantically above it; and her husband is not the sea god of legend, but a fisherman. And for all her strength, she is vulnerable.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As Louise Glück observes in her foreword, “Green Squall begins and ends in the garden”; however, Hopler’s gardens are not of the seasonal variety evoked by poets of the English lyric—his gardens flourish at lower, fiercer latitudes and in altogether different mindscapes. There is a darkness in Hopler’s work as deep and brutal as any in American poetry. Though his verbal extravagance and formal invention bring to mind Wallace Stevens’s tropical extrapolations, there lies beneath Green Squall’s lush tropical surfaces a terrifying world in which nightmare and celebration are indistinguishable, and hope is synonymous with despair.

Employing a variety of forms (from epistolary to script to interview and beyond), this work proves to be as much about exploring frameworks as it is about examining the lives of famous and not-so-famous Americans. Goodman questions our concept of what it means to be an icon: he disrupts our assumptions, creating an alternate universe in which nothing remains sacred.

Metamorphosis reigns in McCallum's universe. A traveller becomes a gargoyle in an Italian piazza, a man may or may not be a marauding badger stalking prey in a dark forest, a woman's face, so her lover fancies, becomes ""a crude/map, an island where her hair falls,/grows over centuries into coral sea."" In McCallum's vision, parables are to be found everywhere: in granite, in the roar of unseen rapids, in one of those glass floats anyone might find on a beach, or in the hearts and minds of pilgrims, pioneers and, of course, poets.

In his foreword to the volume Hugo says:  ""William Virgil Davis is a poet who, when he writes, contends with a loving self who wants to render the world as found. His battle is the classic one, the memory versus the imagination. . . . 'Memory is the first property of loss,' Davis tells us, and that may be true. At least it is worth considering. Certainly a scene, no matter how initially unattractive, reconstructed lovingly in active language posing as passive recall is a true property of gain. Davis believes in and works to create a world we can humanely attend the second time around, and his poems often provide that second chance.""

Can a life be invented the way a poem can? What does it mean for a precocious child, or a responsible grownup, to depict the world we want?

The child of emancipated slaves, he overcame the violent segregationism of Jim Crow, challenging white boxers and white America to become the first African-American heavyweight world champion. The Big Smoke, Adrian Matejka's third work of poetry, follows the fighter's journey from poverty to the most coveted title in sports through the multi-layered voices of Johnson and the white women he brazenly loved. Matejka's book is part historic reclamation and part interrogation of Johnson's complicated legacy, one that often misremembers the magnetic man behind the myth.

Drawing on the work of Husserl, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, Luke Fischer makes a new contribution to the tradition of phenomenological poetics and expands the debate among Germanists concerning the phenomenological status of Rilke's poetry, which has been severely limited to comparisons of Rilke and Husserl. Fischer explicates an implicit phenomenology of perception in Rilke's writings from his middle period (1902-1910). He argues that Rilke cultivated an artistic perception that, in a philosophically significant manner, overcomes the opposition between the sensuous and the intelligible while simultaneously transcending the boundaries of philosophy. Fischer offers novel interpretations of central poems from Rilke's Neue Gedichte (1907) and Der neuen Gedichte anderer Teil (1908) and frames them as the ultimate articulation of Rilke's non-dualistic vision. He thus demonstrates the continuity between Rilke and phenomenology while arguing that poetry, in this case, provides the most adequate response to a philosophical problem""--  ""A groundbreaking contribution to Rilke scholarship that significantly expands the existing debate concerning the relation between Rilke's poetry and phenomenological philosophy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Her language is exquisite, each word falling perfectly into precise structures of vision. Whether in a loose sonnet form or in a taut longer line, these poems are exercises in the extension of the soul.  Devotional and pure, Sophie Cabot Black's voice is one of inconstant waiting, of meditation on edge.  The Misunderstanding of Nature encompasses two New Worlds: the contemporary one and the one of seventeenth-century New England. At its epiphany, this collection presents a long poem called ""The Arguments,"" a monologue in the voice of Dorothy Bradford, one of the first Englishwomen to have set foot in America. Through her complicated search for transcendence, we overhear the movements of learning to belong, caught at the rim of the wilderness.

Inclusive of hitherto marginalised voices, these poems explore the hyphenated and variegated ways of being Asian Australian, and demonstrate how the different origins and traditions transplanted from Asia have generated new and different ways of being Australian. This anthology highlights the complexity of Asian Australian interactions between cultures and languages, and is a landmark in a rich, diversely-textured and evolving story. Timely and proactive this anthology fills existing cultural gaps in poetic expressions of home, travel, diaspora, identity, myth, empire and language.

Purpura reminds us that short poems, never merely brief nor fragmentary, can transcend their size, like small dogs, espresso, a drop of mercury""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With Radial Symmetry, she has created a transcendent body of poems that flourish in the liminal spaces that separate scientific inquiry from empathic knowledge, astute observation from sublime witness. Larson's inventive lyrics lead the reader through vertiginous landscapes—geographical, phenomenological, psychological—while always remaining attendant to the speaker's own fragile, creaturely self. An experienced research scientist and field ecologist, Larson dazzles with these sensuous and sophisticated poems, grappling with the powers of poetic imagination as well as the frightful realization of the human capacity for ecological destruction. The result is a profoundly moving collection: eloquent in its lament and celebration.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""The poems in Wearing Heels in the Rust Belt overflow with vivid, gritty imagery. Weyant's intelligent voice conjures scenes of hard-working characters struggling to not just survive, but thrive in their challenging circumstances. This chapbook captures an essential, flamboyant defiance against the landscape, women painting their nails bright colors even as their night-shifts in factories cover them with cuts, bruises, and grime. Karen J. Weyant is an important new talent and I eagerly anticipate reading more of her wonderful work!""    —Jeannine Hall Gailey     author of She Returns to the Floating World  ""Gathered here are poems of place, a place where everything tastes, faintly, of rust. The speakers are girls and women used to moving through the fields, junkyards, and factories of the rust belt, through towns 'made of churches / and bars.' They speak for those often overlooked girls who come of age by learning 'to balance in heels, in mud / or dust or rubble.' Here are poems both accurate in description and true in spirit.""     —Sandy Longhorn,     author of Blood Almanac  ""The women and girls that populate Karen J. Weyant's new collection are enigmatic: sharpened by too-early experience, yet with a keen eye and ear for the beauty to be found in their dangerous landscape. Whether it is the blood red of a harvest moon or the rust flaking off an old pick-up truck, the crinkle of an emptied beer can or a jar of trapped bees, Weyant, like her women, conjures a new Rust Belt, broken down to its gritty, elemental base and hauntingly gorgeous.""    —Katie Cappello,     author of Perpetual Care   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A spellbinding storyteller and a poet who makes the demands of the form seem as natural as a handshake, she pulls readers into the beat and whirl of her slyly devastating descriptions.""-Booklist"" Whoever told you poetry isn't for everyone hasn't read Lucia Perillo. She writes accessible, often funny poems that border on the profane.""-Time Out New YorkThe poetry of Lucia Perillo is fierce, tragicomic, and contrarian, with subjects ranging from coyotes and Scotch broom to local elections and family history. Formally braided, Perillo gathers strands of the mythic and mundane, of media and daily life, as she faces the treachery of illness and draws readers into poems rich in image and story.When you spend many hours alone in a room you have more than the usual chances to disgust yourself- this is the problem of the body, not that it is mortal but that it is mortifying. When we were young they taught us do not touch it, but who can keep from touching it, from scratching off the juicy scab?  Today I bit a thick hangnail and thought of Schneebaum, who walked four days into the jungle and stayed for the kindness of the tribe- who would have thought that cannibals would be so tender?Lucia Perillo's Inseminating the Elephant (Copper Canyon Press, 2009) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and received the Bobbitt award from the Library of Congress.

Dimitrov critiques America's long-lasting obsessions with money, celebrity, and escapism-whether in our personal, professional, or family lives. What defines a life? Is love ever enough? Who are we when together and who are we by ourselves? These questions echo throughout the poems, which resist easy answers. The voice is both heartfelt and skeptical, bruised yet playful, and always deeply introspective""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On the desire to levitate,Alison Powell,poetry,First published in 2014,/works/OL23180056W?edition=ia%3Aondesiretolevita0000powe,/authors/OL8786346A/Alison_Powell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL31016023M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Ohio University Press|Language English|Pages 51,"""On the Desire to Levitate is the first collection of poems by Alison Powell. This striking collection includes vivid, unflinching meditations on aging, mythology, poetry, and family. In tight, elegant lines that alternate between homage and elegy, these poems explore known subjects with a rebellious eye: a defeated Hercules and a bitter Eurydice, a sympathetic Lucifer, and generations of adolescent girls as mythical adventurers moving within a beloved but confining Midwest. Yet in Powell's skillful hands, hardship never overtakes: as judge Charles Hood writes, ""There's often a delicious humor in this work, and always a deep and lasting integrity.""

The complete poems of A.R. Ammons,A. R. Ammons,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL19719637W?edition=ia%3Acompletepoemsofa0000ammo,/authors/OL265373A/A._R._Ammons,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26932766M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  W. W. Norton & Company|Language English,"""So I said I am Ezra / and the wind whipped my throat / gaming for the sounds of my voice. . . ."" So begins one of the most remarkable oeuvres in the history of American poetry. The Complete Poems of A. R. Ammons, Volume I presents the first half of Archie Randolph Ammons's long career, including the complete texts of his three book-length poems from that period: the verse diary Tape for the Turn of the Year, the Bollingen Prize-winning Sphere: The Form of a Motion, and the daring kaleidoscope of The Snow Poems, which late in life Ammons said of all his long poems was his favorite. Here are many of Ammons's most widely celebrated lyrics and meditations, including ""Corsons Inlet,"" ""Still,"" ""Gravelly Run,"" and ""The City Limits."" Others are more directly inspired by his roots in the rural south, among them ""Nelly Myers,"" ""Silver,"" and ""Mule Song."" Here too are conversations with mountains (as in ""Classic"" and ""Mountain Talk"") and exchanges with the wind (""The Wide Land"" and ""Mansion""), materialist explanations of reality (""Mechanism"" and ""Catalyst"") and prayers (such as the several poems titled ""Hymn""). A poet drawn to theorizing about poetry, Ammons offers both sophisticated discussions of the art (as in ""Poetics"" and ""Essay on Poetics"") and disarming assurance: ""I believe in fun."" The text of each poem has been established after careful consideration of Ammons's manuscripts and other prepublication materials. Endnotes detail the poems' composition and publication histories, and also helpfully annotate references made within the poems. This volume confirms Richard Howard's judgment: ""Here was a great poet, surely one of the largest to speak among us."" -- !c From dust jacket, Volume 1.  ""If you will sit with me in the light // of speech, I will sit with you. . . ."" Readers who accept that invitation will find themselves in extraordinary company. The Complete Poems of A. R. Ammons, Volume II presents the second half of Archie Randolph Ammons's long career, including the complete texts of his two book-length poems from that period: Garbage, for which he won his second National Book Award, and Glare, which drew special praise from the Academy of American Poets as it bestowed on him its highest honor, the Wallace Stevens Award. In addition, two appendices offer over one hundred and twenty previously uncollected poems dating from the 1950s to the late 1990s. Among this volume's many highlights are celebrations of the natural world (such as ""Hermit Lark"" and ""Lofty Calling""), poems of remembrance (as in ""Chinaberry"" and ""Keeping Track""), prayers (""Singling & Doubling Together"" and ""Autonomy""), and compelling meditations on loss and mortality (such as ""Easter Morning"" and ""In View of the Fact""). As in Volume I, the variety of scale is remarkable, ranging from the massiveness of Glare to the haiku-like brevity of ""Pebble's Story."" The text of each poem has been established after careful consideration of Ammons's manuscripts and other prepublication materials. Endnotes detail the poems' composition and publication histories, and also helpfully annotate references made within the poems. Celebrated poetry critic Helen Vendler's introduction both humanizes Ammons and traces the growth of his outsized stature as a major poet, ""unquestionably among the best-loved poets of our time"" (David Lehman). -- !c From dust jacket, Volume 2.

Heathen,R. Flowers Rivera,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL32837780W,/authors/OL8642389A/R._Flowers_Rivera,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Lotus Press|Language English|Pages 114,"Divided into four sections, Heathen is a unified collection of poetry satisfying both intellectual and emotional appetites. The vocabulary, phrasing, and figurative language prove author R. Flowers Rivera to be a master of technique. A few of the poems include ""Black English"" suggesting that they are universal in their application. The characters in Part I, Isle of Promethea, bring classical mythology, especially Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, vividly to life through applications to modern life and a sense of being present. Part II, I Am Hephaestus, consists of a single poem with the same title divided into twelve sections and continues its mythological basis. In Part III, Doubt, there is more variety, suggested by epigraphs by authors as different as James Seamon Cotter, Jr, Gertrude Stein, and the author of the biblical book of John; personal and symbolic romantic love is introduced in such poems as ""Vivid,"" ""Anniversary Apart,"" and ""Stay"" although the ""you"" does not necessarily refer to a person. ""Her,"" for example, describes a poet's pen as ""a fickle lover"" who refuses to produce the magic words of poetry. Part IV, ""Mustard Seed,"" is the most personal section as ""a conversation with myself."" Here the author transforms the ordinary into provocative extraordinary expression. Her love of the South, the simple act of ironing clothing on a hot summer day, driving a car, braiding a child's hair, and observing a Muslim man praying at an airport are some of the subjects in this final group. This is an extremely satisfying collection of poems that invites the reader to return to it again and again.--Publisher's description.
