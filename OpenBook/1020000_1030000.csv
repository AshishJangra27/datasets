The second section, ""Back in the World,"" returns us to the States but not necessarily to sanity as Soular wades through the psychological aftereffects of the war for both veterans and their families.""

Denken over poëzie en vertalen,Désirée Schyns,poetry,First published in 2018,/works/OL20930014W,/authors/OL8011581A/Désirée_Schyns,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Academia Press|Pages 172,"This volume of Lage Landen Studies has a twofold purpose: on the one hand we want to pay attention to the scholarly work on the Dutch author Cees Nooteboom, in particular to his poetry in translation which has hardly received any academic attention yet, and on the other hand we would like to contribute to trends in Translation Studies which focus on agency, subjectivity, intention, translators poetics and creativity in translated texts. Indeed, in the last decade the focus of Translation Studies has shifted to the translator who plays such an important role in the circulation of cultural products nowadays. In this volume the contributions not only focus on Nooteboom’s poems in translation, but also on Nooteboom as a translator of poetry himself, again a subject which has hardly been studied yet. The first part opens with an introduction on Nooteboom’s poetry by Susanne Schaber, editor of the Gesammelte Werke at Suhrkamp Verlag in Germany. In the second contribution of this section Ton Naaijkens gives a plea for intuition and creativity in scholarly work on translation. The second section deals with Cees Nooteboom as a translator of poetry. Esther Op de Beek, who contributed together with Nooteboom on the book Avenue (fifteen years of world literature), highlights the position of Nooteboom as a cultural mediator. Stéphanie Vanastens contribution analyses this mediation position with the help of a concrete case study of two French poets translated and presented by Nooteboom to the Dutch and Flemish public of Avenue. Yves T’Sjoen addresses methodological issues for translation scholars who want to study the work of writer-translators such as Claus and Nooteboom. In the last section, the translated poetry of Nooteboom forms the centre of the contributions. Jane Fenoulhet focusses on four English translations of the poem ‘Bashō’, Stefaan Evenepoel on two translations of ‘Leeftocht’ and in the round table discussion translators Ard Posthuma, David Colmer, Irinia Michajlova and Philippe Noble discuss their translators’ choices with the poet Cees Nooteboom. In his afterword the poet reflects on the round table and the symposium in Ghent in November 2016 which formed the exciting starting point for this volume.  Hoe verlenen vertalers zichzelf toegang tot een wereld waarvoor een sleutel, een ontcijfering nodig is?    De poëzie van Cees Nooteboom, de kern van zijn oeuvre, werd  vertaald in de grootste Europese talen. Maar ook zelf droeg de dichter bij als vertaler: hij publiceerde talrijke vertalingen van internationaal vermaarde collega’s in het legendarische maandblad Avenue. Deze bundel van Lage Landen Studies neemt het werk van Nooteboom als inspirator van vertalingen en als resultaat van een vertaalproces onder de loep. De auteurs verkennen nieuwe richtingen in het denken over poëzie vertalen en bespreken Nootebooms bemiddelende rol als redacteur-vertaler. Denken over poëzie en vertalen geeft lezers inzicht in de werkwijze van vertalers met analyses van vertaalde gedichten en een discussie met Nooteboom en zijn poëzievertalers over concrete vertaalkeuzes.

His third book of poetry, Looking for The Gulf Motel, is a genealogy of the heart, exploring how his family’s emotion legacy has shaped—and continues shaping—his perspectives.  The collection is presented in three movements, each one chronicling his understanding of a particular facet of life from childhood into adulthood. As a child born into the milieu of his Cuban exiled familia, the first movement delves into early questions of cultural identity and their evolution into his unrelenting sense of displacement and quest for the elusive meaning of home. The second, begins with poems peering back into family again, examining the blurred lines of gender, the frailty of his father-son relationship, and the intersection of his cultural and sexual identities as a Cuban-American gay man living in rural Maine.  In the last movement, poems focused on his mother’s life shaped by exile, his father’s death, and the passing of a generation of relatives, all provide lessons about his own impermanence in the world and the permanence of loss. Looking for the Gulf Motel is looking for the beauty of that which we cannot hold onto, be it country, family, or love.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Some poems are in a raw form, scibbles and all--wonderfully imperfect, like her. The book's title symbolizes what she believes love does in each of us when returned. Throughout her life's struggles, love has conquered her fears, even in her darkest hours. When she felt like giving up, love and faith kept her hopeful and willing to love another day, thanks to God's amazing grace. This will cause you to laugh, cry, and reflect the pages of your life.

Mr. Bluebird, the second collection of poetry from award-winning author Gerry Gomez Pearlberg, explores the intersections between ecology, the imagination, urban nature, lesbian nature, and the nature of the human heart.  The book is as much a cry of sorrow in the face of the biological holocaust as a celebration of the wild creatures and places that remind us of what sanity looks and feels like. These wide-ranging poems feature a cast of characters that includes St. Francis of Assisi, St. Augustine, Bart Simpson, Sal Mineo, Paul Bowles, Gertrude Stein, Mr. Eggroll, Mr. Chips, and a tough blue rose named Mr. Bluebird.

Formally inventive and technically sophisticated, Daniel Hall attends to the power of death to haunt every perception. The poet’s voice registers as though he were walking on the bottom of the ocean, in a state of mind somewhere “under sleep,” in a kind of waking dream. In Hall’s hands, isolated moments of perception bloom into truly touching love elegies.  The poems in Under Sleep were written over a period of ten years and, as a result, are densely interconnected, with lines and entire stanzas transplanted between different poems. Using styles ranging from free verse to sonnets, Sapphics, and rhymed haikus, Hall populates the book with literary and historical figures—Baudelaire, Pound, and Casanova—in poems set in China, the Middle East, Death Valley, and Italy. Throughout, the poetry is propelled by tension as the speaker struggles with his own better judgment—and against his lover’s wishes—to turn the loss of the beloved into art.

A companion volume to Against Forgetting, Poetry of Witness is the first anthology to reveal a tradition that runs through English-language poetry. The 300 poems collected here were composed at an extreme of human endurance--while their authors awaited execution, endured imprisonment, fought on the battlefield, or labored on the brink of breakdown or death. All bear witness to historical events and the irresistibility of their impact. Alongside Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth, this volume includes such writers as Anne Askew, tortured and executed for her religious beliefs during the reign of Henry VIII; Phillis Wheatley, abducted by slave traders; Samuel Bamford, present at the Peterloo Massacre in 1819; William Blake, who witnessed the Gordon Riots of 1780; and Samuel Menashe, survivor of the Battle of the Bulge. Poetry of Witness argues that such poets are a perennial feature of human history, and it presents the best of that tradition, proving that their work ranks alongside the greatest in the language.

In tongues alternately vulnerable, defiant, resigned and hopeful, The Inquisition Yours speaks to the atrocities of our time – war, environmental destruction, terrorism, cancer and the erosion of personal rights – fashioning a tenuous bridge between the political and the personal.  Trying to make sense of a world where even language is 'a danger,' Currin’s poems reject the old storylines in favor of a vigilant awareness, and wonder what might happen if we 'change the feared penmanship' and embrace a narrative that empowers everyone.

Still, Percy Bysshe Shelley endures today as the great Promethean bard of the High Romantic period who is best remembered for extolling the sublime and affirming the possibility of transcendence. This Modern Library edition contains all of Shelley's magnificent poetry: the political epics Queen Mab and The Revolt of Islam, along with the shorter poem The Mask of Anarchy; his hymns, odes, and verse epistles; ""Adonais,"" a classical elegy on the death of Keats; Julian and Maddalo, a poetic treatment of his friendship with Byron; and the five-act verse tragedy The Cenci. Included as well are Alastor, or the Spirit of Solitude; Epipsychidion, perhaps the most outspoken and eloquent appeal for free love in the language; the satiric Peter Bell the Third; and the great unfinished poem The Triumph of Life. Presented too is Shelley's visionary masterpiece Prometheus Unbound, the grand lyrical drama often compared with Dante's Paradiso. ""If any one who has read [Prometheus Unbound] still supposes that ... Shelley is any other than a very great poet, I cannot help him,"" said C. S. Lewis. With an introduction and notes by the poet's widow, Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. - Jacket flap.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The Cambridge introduction to Victorian poetry,Linda K.

Publication in widely-circulating periodicals, reprinting in book reviews, and excerpting in novels and essays ensured that major poets such as Tennyson, Browning, Hardy and Rossetti were household names, and they remain popular today. The Cambridge Introduction to Victorian Poetry provides an accessible overview of British poetry from 1830 to 1901, paying particular attention to its role in mass media print culture. Designed to interest both students and scholars, the book traces lively dialogues between poets and explains poets' choices of form, style and language. It also demonstrates poetry's relevance to Victorian debates on science, social justice, religion, imperialism, and art. Featuring a glossary of literary terms, a guide to further reading, and two examples of close readings of Victorian poems, this introduction is the ideal starting-point for the study of verse in the nineteenth century""--Provided by publisher.  ""the Introduction maps formal practices and a series of social debates within which poems, both canonical and lesser-known, jostled against, answered, and challenged each other for aesthetic and cultural pre-eminence. It is a less tidy, occasionally even more discordant account of poetry than is found in some literary histories but is meant to highlight the liveliness""--Provided by publisher.

In turns sad, troubled and angry, her voice has always been one of great empathy, knowing, as she says, “the only mercy is memory.” In this, her 12th book of poetry, the National Book Award-winner speaks to the tenuous relationship between mothers and daughters, the debilitating power of cancer, the open wound of racial prejudice, the redemptive gift of story-telling. “September Song,” a sequence of seven poems, featured on National Public Radio, presents a modern-day Orpheus who, through her grief, attempts to heart-intelligently respond to the events of September 11th. The last sequence of poems—a tightly-woven fabric of caveats and prayers—was initially written in the 1970s, then revised and reshaped in the last few years.

Poet of landscape, myth and memory, Soso Tham paid rich and poignant tribute to his tribe in his masterpiece The Old Days of the Khasis. Janet Hujon’s vibrant new translation presents the English reader with Tham’s long poem, which keeps a rich cultural tradition of the Khasi people alive through its retelling of old narratives and acts as a cultural signpost for their literary identity.    This book is essential reading for anyone with an interest in Indian literature and culture and in the interplay between oral traditions and written literary forms.

Most American poets wrote for children—from famous names such as Ralph Waldo Emerson to less familiar figures like Christina Moody, an African American author who published her first book at sixteen. In its excellence, relevance, and abundance, much of this work rivals or surpasses poetry written for adults, yet it has languished—inaccessible and unread—in old periodicals, gift books, and primers. This groundbreaking anthology remedies that loss, presenting material that is both critical to the tradition of American poetry and also a delight to read.

These poems fly in from other countires. They blur the speed of prayers with alt.rock lyrics. In the poems continents reverse themselves as if drifting in amniotic fluid, lines of lineage re-emerge and voices in other languages adopt themselves to various new forms of speech. The speaker arrives from time to time. She is like snow. She takes short holidays. She smiles at birthday cards. She can eat anything that doesn’t criticize her. Some of her ex-lovers were not teenagers. She flits from Tagalog to East Villagese. She has a halogen stereo and waits for ‘my late great Chachi.’ She goes to clubs and raw bars and a street in Tagatay. She tries on her butterfly kite. Through all this, she is the breathless sum of her various accoutrements: crystal and sea-egg, a borealis, a lamp, a holidaypipe, a Paloma, a sister. A beautiful book.” —Tan Lin  “The poems in Sarah Gambito’s first book, Matadora, are sheer juxtapositions of anything–star fish, Tagalog, frisson– and the friction very often adds a political dimension to the poetic. Lovely!” —Kimiko Hahn  “Early in Sarah Gambito’s book, we learn that ‘You cannot be in two places at once.’ In fact, the personality presented in these poems (they are personal poems; that is to say, they have their own unique and consistent personality) seems to have come from Elsewhere, on the way to Everywhere.” —Keith Waldrop   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The essays posit various foundations, gradations, and practices of poetic dialogism; theorize a diverse scope and purpose of dialogic poetry, from secluded prayer to political activism; and examine subgenres of poetry as well as discourses from the Bible to Amos 'n' Andy. In doing so, they contribute to the field of ethics and literature as well, insisting that poetry may be even profoundly oriented toward an Other, whether that dialogism is traceable in speech acts; in differentiated consciousnesses, ideologies, discourses, languages, or allusions; in the rhythm, intonation, or formal devices that encode such exchange; or in the production or reception of the poem.

These classic works of mysticism and desire inspired countless people in Rumi's time and throughout the centuries.Born Jalal ad-Din Mohammed Balkhi in Persia early in the thirteenth century, the poet known as Rumi expressed the deepest feelings of the heart through his poetry. This volume consists of new translations edited by Deepak Chopra to evoke the rich mood and music of Rumi's love poems. Exalted yearning, ravishing ecstasy, and consuming desire emerge from these poems as powerfully today as they did on their creation more than 700 years ago. 'These poems reflect the deepest longings of the human heart as it searches for the divine. They celebrate love. Each poetic whisper is urgent, expressing the desire that penetrates human relationships and inspires intimacy with the self, silently nurturing an affinity for the Beloved. Both Fereydoun Kia, the translator, and I hope that you will share the experience of ravishing ecstasy that the poems of Rumi evoked in us. In this volume we have sought to capture in English the dreams, wishes, hopes, desires, and feelings of a Persian poet who continues to amaze, bewilder, confound, and teach, one thousand years after he walked on this earth' - Deepak Chopra   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Kad se jedina knjiga koja nedostaje u zbirci pojavi u aukcijskoj kući u Londonu, oni nagovore bivšeg agenta FBI-a Willa Pipera da im pomogne doći do nje.

I Made My Boy Out of Poetry (eBook),Aberjhani,poetry,First published in 1998,/works/OL5968390W,/authors/OL1482143A/Aberjhani,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11740160M-M.jpg,Publish Date February 1998|Publisher  Washington Publications|Language English|Pages 116,"I Made My Boy Out of Poetry is a powerful literary vision of rare scope, beauty and emotional intensity composed of stories and poems that flow in and out of each other like the most lucid and articulate of dreams. These are portraits and studies of individual souls attempting to make peace with an awareness of themselves as beings more spiritual than material in a world given largely to the latter. This book offers an amazing journey through the heart and soul of a modern seeker of visions.     Containing six stories and fifty poems, I Made My Boy Out of Poetry, by Savannah poet and author Aberjhani, was initially published by Washington Publications in 1998. The first cover featured an original oil painting by native New Orleans artist Gustave Blache III.  The stories and poems in I Made My Boy Out of Poetry were written from the early 1980s to the late 1990s. For that reason, they reflect a synthesis of polished academic form and the raw energy of spoken word culture that emerged in the United States during the 1990s.  Prior to its publication, work from the title appeared in a number of both well-established and underground  publications. These included: The African-American Literary Review; The Angry Fixx; The Dull Fly; The Georgia Guardian; Out of the Blue; Poets, Artists, and Madmen; The Savannah Literary Journal; and The Savannah Tribune. Later, ESSENCE Magazine featured work from the title.  Reviews of I Made My Boy Out of Poetry have hailed the book for its creative daring, spiritual vitality, and intellectual range. Weighing in from the University of North Caroline in Greensboro, playwright and poet Mark Smith Soto noted the following of the author: “He has a powerful understanding of the music words can make, not only with their sound but with their meanings… he has intelligence, emotional range, imagination, and is alive to the very tips of his fingers.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Archaic and classical Greek epigram,Manuel Baumbach,poetry,First published in 2010,/works/OL18574568W,/authors/OL1538731A/Manuel_Baumbach,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""With contributions written by leading experts in the field, this volume explores the dialogue between Archaic and Classical Greek epigrams and their readers. The authors examine questions surrounding the identity of the speakers and the addressees. They also discuss the spatial, religious, historical and political contexts of epigram, as well as aspects of intertextuality, poetic variation and the creation of epigrammatic sub-genres. Collectively the volume demonstrates that the dominant view of epigram as a genre that became literary and artistic only in the Hellenistic period has to be revised. Archaic and Classical Greek epigrams did not simply serve the objects they describe but also demonstrate a high degree of aesthetic and literary achievement. This volume breaks new ground in the study of the genre and is important for scholars of classics, archaeology, epigraphy and papyrology""--Provided by publisher.  ""Epigram stands apart from other early Greek poetic genres by being from the start a written genre, and moreover by being a written genre with a fixed physical context. In the case of sepulchral epigram this physical context is that of a grave or a cenotaph, thus making the epigram an integral part of a monument, a physical object in a fixed place, commemorating one or more persons""--Provided by publisher.

Critics who said that his last collection kicked ""like an old pump-12 gauge"" will be happy to find the barrels sawed off in this book. Reese shows no sign of putting the hammer down—he takes his reader on the daily routine and long nights that are an inescapable part of raising two small daughters—shows us how family is not a burden but a complex source of joy. Ride shotgun with him down the lonesome byways of the Great Plains westward into San Quentin prison, where he has full access and isn't afraid to ask the hard questions. Author John Price writes: ""Reese's beautiful and powerful poems are born of 'wish and skin and bone,' of dirt and dignity, of faith and fry grease, of laughter and lament. To read them is to be carried to a place where risk is a promise fulfilled—whether it be the homing memory of a grandfather or eating suspicious pastries or raising children or teaching poetry to inmates. It is a place where the familiar opens into the extraordinary, and even, at times, the miraculous.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pierre Reverdy,Pierre Reverdy,poetry,First published in 1965,/works/OL19970774W?edition=ia%3Apierrereverdy0000reve,/authors/OL129484A/Pierre_Reverdy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL33023532M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1965|Language French|Pages 237,""" Pierre Reverdy, who was close to Picasso and Braque and was enormously admired by the surrealists, is one the greatest of modern French poets and one of the most elusive. His work is at once impersonal and intimate, crystalline and opaque, simplicity itself and mysterious as can be. Paul Auster has described his poems as combining an ""intense inwardness with a proliferation of sensual data.... The poet seems to evaporate, to vanish into the haunted country he has created...as if Reverdy had emptied the space of the poem in order to let the reader inhabit it."" Auster is only one of many American writers to be drawn to the mystery of Reverdy's unsettling world. There is also Frank O'Hara, who carried Reverdy's poems in his pocket and wrote (in lines that don't just mention but echo Reverdy): and surely we shall not continue to be unhappy we shall be happy but we shall continue to be ourselves everything continues to be possible Rene Char, Pierre Reverdy, Samuel Beckett it is possible isn't it I love Reverdy for saying yes, though I don't believe it. And John Ashbery has shown himself to be no less devoted than his friend O'Hara to Reverdy, whose poems he has translated throughout his career. The strength of this new selection of Reverdy's poetry, which includes both translations that have been specially commissioned for this volume along with a range of outstanding earlier ones, is not only to provide a sampling of Reverdy's finest work in all its variety but also to document the appeal it has had for so many of America's best writers and translators. Reverdy is represented by work early and late, from the pioneering Prose Poems of 1915 and Roof Slates of 1918 to his violently conceived and brutally worded, war-haunted poems of 1946 to 1948, entitled The Song of the Dead (originally illustrated by Picasso) to his final Freedom of the Seas of 1960. The twelve distinguished translators involved are John Ashbery, Dan Bellm, Mary Ann Caws, Lydia Davis, Marilyn Hacker, Richard Howard, Geoffrey O'Brien, Ron Padgett, Mark Polizzotti, Kenneth Rexroth, Richard Sieburth, and Rosanna Warren""--  ""Pierre Reverdy is among the greatest of modern French poets, and certainly among the most elusive. His work is at once impersonal and intimate, crystalline and opaque, simple to the point of austerity. The landscape of his poetry is both instantly recognizable and, devoid of local specificity, imbued with an otherworldly strangeness. He is 'a secret poet for secret readers,' as Octavio Paz once described him, insisting on the necessity of parsing the silence, the empty spaces between what seems visible in the lines of his poems. Each feels like a fragment of a universe, and yet whole""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Epic poetry has always had a profound influence on other literary genres, including its own parody in the form of mock-epic. This Companion surveys over four thousand years of epic poetry from the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh to Derek Walcott's postcolonial Omeros. The list of epic poets analysed here includes some of the greatest writers in literary history in Europe and beyond: Homer, Virgil, Dante, Camões, Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats and Pound, among others. Each essay, by an expert in the field, pays close attention to the way these writers have intimately influenced one another to form a distinctive and cross-cultural literary tradition. Unique in its coverage of the vast scope of that tradition, this book is an essential companion for students of literature of all kinds and in all ages""--Provided by publisher.

In this collection of haiku, translator Sam Hamill has compiled the best from the tradition, spanning the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, with particular focus on the three great masters: Bashō, Buson, and Issa. Based on images from nature, the poems address the themes of joy, temporality, beauty, wonder, loneliness, and loss. Haiku may be the most popular and widely recognizable poetic form in the world. In just three lines a great haiku presents a crystalline moment of image, emotion, and awareness. Elements of compassion, silence, and a sense of temporality often combine to reveal a quality of mystery. Just as often, haiku may bring a startling insight into the ordinary, or a flash of humor. Collected here are over two hundred of the best haiku of Japanese literature--written by the great masters of the genre. The featured poets are Bashō; Buson, Issa, Moritake, Soin, Sanpu, Kikaku, Ransetsu, Kyorai, Raizan, Kakei, Onitsura, Taigi, Chiyo, Sogetsuni, Sogi, Fuhaku, Teiga, Kikusha-ni, Tayo-jo, ha, and Shiki.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With the Dead Women, a community of spirits she attracts before but especially after September 11, 2001, Alma surveys with disbelief and horror the actions of the United States government as it perpetrates one war and prepares for another.

His new work, Hip Logic, is full of poetic tributes to the likes of Paul Robeson, Big Bird, Balthus, and Mr. T, as well as poems based on the anagram principle of words within a word. Throughout, Hayes's verse dances in a kind of homemade music box, with notes that range from tender to erudite, associative to narrative, humorous to political. Hip Logic does much to capture the nuances of contemporary male African American identity and confirms Hayes's reputation as one of the most compelling new voices in American poetry.

The Tao of Emerson: the wisdom of the tao te ching as found in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson,Ralph Waldo Emerson,poetry,First published in 2007,/works/OL415658W,/authors/OL18405A/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11129069M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Modern Library|Language English|Pages 176,"The Tao of Emerson strikingly brings together two of the most influential voices in the history of letters: Lao Tse, the sixth-century B.C. Chinese mystic, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, the American transcendentalist known to many as ""the sage of Concord."" By adroitly juxtaposing on facing pages the texts of Lao Tse's masterpiece, the Tao Te Ching, with Emerson's writings, Richard Grossman illuminates how these two remarkable men, from opposite sides of the world and separated by 2,500 years, are united in an inspired wisdom and common spirit: to live simply and tranquilly; trust one's own intuition; seek out and appreciate the spiritual grace in the natural world; act without self-assertion; abjure violence; harmonize with the ebb and flow of nature and circumstances; and, above all, assure that there is a place in the world for humility, yielding, gentleness, and serenity.There is no direct path linking Lao Tse to Emerson, since the Tao Te Ching was not translated into English until 1891, nine years after Emerson's death. But America's Founding Thinker was nonetheless in many ways the heir to the great Chinese mystic's insight and philosophy. As Grossman observes, ""Emerson's brand of fresh home-grown English adds a radiant color to the ancient thoughts of the Chinese Master."" Although Lao Tse was a citizen of the world's oldest empire and Emerson of its youngest republic, The Tao of Emerson makes the brilliantly presented case that a common literary thread binds these two men. Grossman's Introduction, in which he compares the men's lives, and the passages he has selected from their work give both writers a special resonance for today's reader and help to reveal Emerson in a while new light.This volume includes original brush calligraphy by the celebrated Taoist master Chungliang Al Huang.Praise for The Tao of Emerson""This inspired book from one of Emerson's strongest readers is a great gift.  Through the reflected light of the Tao Te Ching, Richard Grossman has made the core of Emerson's wisdom transparent, allowing us to see into the heart of what makes the sage of Concord our very own Lao Tse."" --Richard G. Geldard, editor of The Essential Transcendentalists""One measure of a spiritually serious book is whether it repeatedly stops us dead in our tracks as we read it and allows us to foresee the ultimate triumph of truth and principle in our lives and in the life of the world.  This is such a book."" --Jacob Needleman, author of Why Can't We Be Good?""Deeply immersing himself in both the wisdom of Lao Tse and the philosophy of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Richard Grossman has produced a remarkable Guide to life, a handbook filled with venerable worlds combined to yield a new poetry of the mind.  Reading it, 'we stand,' with Emerson, 'before the secrets of the world.'"" --Megan Marshall, author of The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism""This marvelous volume will bring joy and light to those who know or even suspect that Emersonianism is not a system, a product, or a position but a way or a path.  For those who haven't yet gotten it but want to try, this book is the perfect place to start."" --Robert D. Richardson, Jr., author of Emerson: The Mind on FireFrom the Hardcover edition.

A companion piece to Kent Nerburn's book Simple Truths, Small Graces is a journey into the sacred moments that illuminate our everyday lives. Through the exploration of simple acts, he reminds us to chart a course each day that nourishes the soul, honors the body, and engages the mind. Small Graces asks us to observe life's quiet rhythms, the subtle shifts in perception and changes in light, the warm comfort of family voices; to feel the blessing of birdsong, the solitude of a falling leaf, the echo of footfall in snow-covered woods. By inviting us to recognize the hidden power of the ordinary, Small Graces reveals the mystical alchemy of the mundane made profound by the artistry of a well-lived life.

Ha recogido, en lo heurístico, prácticamente toda la información disponible sobre manuscritos y ediciones; en lo ecdótico ha buscado reproducir las versiones más acreditadas de los originales. El enfoque dominante en el estudio es el histórico-comparativo y se introducen en él oportunas consideraciones sobre retórica, métrica, temática y textología. Hay regadas correcciones y rectificaciones a errores envejecidos o novedosos que representan un correcto sentido crítico del autor, afinado por una experiencia directa sobre los textos.

"El amor, el sueño y la muerte",Jaime Labastida,poetry,First published in 1974,/works/OL955632W,/authors/OL85717A/Jaime_Labastida,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Siglo Veintiuno Editores,              Fundación Azteca|Language Spanish|Pages 470","""Los poemas clásicos de la literatura mexicana que incluye esta edición son motivo para acercarse a tres temas universales que la humanidad lleva en su entraña: el amor, el sueño y la muerte. La manera como son entendidos, sufridos o enfrentados estos temas es lo que constituye la historicidad del hombre. La poesía es el prisma que nos permite sentir, más que ver, los matices de la sensibilidad humana. A 45 años de la primera edición de 'El amor, el sueño y la muerte en la poesía mexicana,' este libro se ha ampliado tanto en la inclusión de poetas y poesías, como en la profundidad de su análisis, lo que nos da un texto que va más allá de la divulgación para dejarnos en la frontera de la especialidad.""--Page 4 of cover.

Spencer's Art,Mark Rose,poetry,First published in 1975,/works/OL2809838W,/authors/OL417562A/Mark_Rose,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7693559M-M.jpg,"Publish Date January 1, 1975|Publisher  Harvard University Press|Language English|Pages 160","I have tried to suggest something of Spenser's richness and subtlety through a reading of Book One, following the poem as it develops canto by canto. In general, I have attempted to draw the meaning out of the text, emphasizing that the poem creates its own world of allusion, becoming increasingly suggestive as it proceeds. There are many aspects of the poem, important aspects such as the historical allegory, that I have ignored or slighted. My intention has not been to provide a complete study of Book One, but merely to indicate to the reader who does not come to Spenser equipped with special expertise how much he may gain through a study of the text itself. On the assumption that most readers will find a short book more useful than a longer one, I have tried to keep my discussions as brief as possible. Necessarily this has meant being selective about which passages and details to comment upon, and in a poem such as The Faerie Queene in which every detail is significant any selection is to some degree a distortion of the text. The reader should recognize this at the outset, realizing that another critic's choices of passages for emphasis might be quite different from my own. - Preface.

Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep, and dreamed she heard them bleating, But when she awoke, ‘twas all a joke – Atlas! They still were fleeting.        Then up she took her little crook, determined for to find them; She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed, They’d left their tails behind them.        It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray Over the meadows hard by, That there she espied their tails side by side, All hung on a tree to dry.    She heaved a sigh, and gave by-and –by Each careless sheep a banging;  And as for the rest she thought it was best just to leave their tails a-hanging.”    “Mary’s Little lamb    Mary had a little lamb Whose fleece was white as snow, And everywhere that Mary went That lamb is would not go;    So Mary took that little Lamb And put it on the spit, And soon it was so nicely done She ate it every bit. “   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here, in Sallies, Romps, Portraits, and Send-Offs, August Kleinzahler eulogizes famous friends, warts and all (Thom Gunn, Christopher Middleton, Leonard Michaels); leads the charge in carving up a few bloated reputations (E.E. Cummings, Richard Brautigan); and sings the praises of unjustly neglected masters (Lucia Berlin, Kenneth Cox). He also turns the spotlight on himself in several short, delightful memoirs, covering such subjects as his obsessive CD collecting, the eerie effects of San Francisco fog, and the terrible duty of selling of his childhood home""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It presents a distinctive variety of Anglo-Norman works, beginning in the twelfth century and ending in the nineteenth, covering a broad range of genres and writers, introduced in a lively and thought-provoking way. Facing-page translations, into accessible and engaging modern English, are provided throughout, bringing these texts to life for a contemporary audience. The collection offers a selection of fascinating passages, and whole texts, many of which are not anthologised or translated anywhere else. It explores little-known byways of Arthurian legend and stories of real-life crime and punishment; women?s voices tell history, write letters, berate pagans; advice is offered on how to win friends and influence people, how to cure people?s ailments and how to keep clear of the law; and stories from the Bible are retold with commentary, together with guidance on prayer and confession.    Each text is introduced and elucidated with notes and full references, and the material is divided into three main sections based on Dean?s Catalogue: Story (a variety of narrative forms), Miscellany (including letters, law and medicine, and other non-fiction), and Religious (saints' lives, sermons, Bible commentary, and prayers). Passages in one genre have been chosen so as to reflect themes or stories that appear in another, so that the book can be enjoyed as a collection or used as a resource to dip into for selected texts.    This anthology is essential reading for students and scholars of Anglo-Norman and medieval literature and culture. Wide-ranging and fully referenced, it can be used as a springboard for further study or relished in its own right by readers interested to discover Anglo-Norman literature that was written to amuse, instruct, entertain, or admonish medieval audiences.""

In this Companion, leading scholars offer informative and thought-provoking essays on his life and social context, his correspondence, all his major collections of poetry including most famously the Duino Elegies and Sonnets to Orpheus, and his seminal novel of Modernist anxiety, The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. Rilke's critical contexts are explored in detail: his relationship with philosophy and the visual arts, his place within modernism and his relationship to European literature, and his reception in Europe and beyond. With its invaluable guide to further reading and a chronology of Rilke's life and work, this Companion will provide an accessible, engaging account of this extraordinary poet whose legacy looms so large today""--Provided by publisher.

They were characterized by talent, idealism, and youthful ardor, and these qualities shaped and informed their politically oppositional stances--as did their chaotic family arrangements, which often left the young women, despite their talents, facing the consequences of the men's philosophies.

Directions to the Beach of the Dead,Richard Blanco,poetry,First published in 2004,/works/OL12561022W,/authors/OL228565A/Richard_Blanco,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22723134M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  University of Arizona Press|Language English|Pages 64,"In his second book of narrative, lyric poetry, Richard Blanco explores the familiar, unsettling journey for home and connections, those anxious musings about other lives: “Should I live here? Could I live here?” Whether the exotic (“I’m struck with Maltese fever …I dream of buying a little Maltese farm…) or merely different (“Today, home is a cottage with morning in the yawn of an open window…”), he examines the restlessness that threatens from merely staying put, the fear of too many places and too little time.  The words are redolent with his Cuban heritage: Marina making mole sauce; Tía Ida bitter over the revolution, missing the sisters who fled to Miami; his father, especially, “his hair once as black as the black of his oxfords…” Yet this is a volume for all who have longed for enveloping arms and words, and for that sanctuary called home. “So much of my life spent like this-suspended, moving toward unknown places and names or returning to those I know, corresponding with the paradox of crossing, being nowhere yet here.” Blanco embraces juxtaposition. There is the Cuban Blanco, the American Richard, the engineer by day, the poet by heart, the rhythms of Spanish, the percussion of English, the first-world professional, the immigrant, the gay man, the straight world. There is the ennui behind the question: why cannot I not just live where I live? Too, there is the precious, fleeting relief when he can write “. . . I am, for a moment, not afraid of being no more than what I hear and see, no more than this: . . .” It is what we all hope for, too.

Lionel’s great, infectious faith in poetry lay in the value he attached to the meeting of writer and reader on the page. Meeting him again in this book is a rare delight."" (Ivan Vladislavic, South African novelist and editor)  ""This is poetry unafraid of history, unafraid of ideas, and committed to the difficult balancing act of bringing both enjoyment and confrontation to the reader ... This book was written in the knowledge of his coming death, through the bizarre period of the change of millennium and the 9/11 attack on New York. As Abrahams farewells his world, there is a new era emerging, and an utterly changed world facing certain terror.""

Poet, novelist, and essayist Erika L. Sánchez's powerful debut poetry collection explores what it means to live on both sides of the border--the border between countries, languages, despair and possibility, and the living and the dead. Sánchez tells her own story as the daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants and as part of a family steeped in faith, work, grief, and expectations. The poems confront sex, shame, race, and an America roiling with xenophobia, violence, and laws of suspicion and suppression. With candor and urgency, and with the unblinking eyes of a journalist, Sánchez roves from the individual life into the lives of sex workers, narco-traffickers, factory laborers, artists, and lovers. What emerges is a powerful, multifaceted portrait of survival. Lessons on Expulsion is the first book by a vibrant, essential new writer now breaking into the national literary landscape.

Form of Forms,Mark Goldstein,poetry,First published in 2012,/works/OL16794393W,/authors/OL515982A/Mark_Goldstein,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25414825M-M.jpg,Publish Date Spring/ Summer 2012|Publisher  BookThug|Pages 112,"First Edition: Mark Goldstein's long poem ""Form of Forms,"" takes as its subject (to paraphrase poet Betsy Warland) Motherloss. It deals with the emotional and bureaucratic nature of identity from the often bewildered and fractured point of view of someone who was relinquished as an infant. Now, as an adult, Goldstein is seeking “information” on the self through the layers and fields of forms one must look through to gain access to that information. These layers and forms are what make up the framework of the poem, and the reader is brought face-to-face with the slippery nature of identity as seen through the lens of adoption.

Constance Quarterman Bridges's father tells this story to his children and says, ""My Babies, we're special people, lions don't eat us."" In this remarkable debut collection, Bridges chronicles her ancestry―part born out of slavery, part descended from Cherokee heritage―from her great-grandparents ""jumping over the broom"" in Civil War Virginia to her father's journey in the Great Migration northward in 1916. The result is an unequivocally American story.  Lions Don't Eat Us is the 2005 winner of the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, given to the best first collection by an African-American poet.

Attempting to imagine the unimaginable and see the unseen, Armantrout evokes a ""next life"" beyond the current, and too often degraded, one. From the new physics to mortality, Armantrout engages with the half-seen and the half-believed. These poems step into the dance of consciousness and its perennial ghost partner—""to make the world up/of provisional pairs."" At a time when our world is being progressively despoiled, Armantrout has emerged as one of our most important and articulate authors. These poems push against the limit of knowledge, that event-horizon, and into the echoes and phantasms beyond, calling us to look toward the ""next life"" and find it where we can.

Rooted in myths that can be traced to the Grebo tradition, Becoming Ebony portrays Liberian-born Wesley’s experiences of village talk and civil war as well as her experiences of the pain of her mother’s death and the difficulties of rearing a family away from home in the United States, and explores the questions of living in the African Diaspora. Turning on the African proverb of “the wandering child” and the metaphor of the ebony tree―which is beautiful in life and death― these poems delve into issues of human suffering and survival, plainly and beautifully chronicling what happens “after the sap is gone.”   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The Death of King Arthur,Simon Armitage,poetry,First published in 2012,/works/OL16184115W?edition=ia%3Adeathofkingarthu0000unse_b3z5,/authors/OL333917A/Simon_Armitage,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25060971M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  W. W. Norton & Co.|Language English,"The Alliterative Morte Arthure - the title given to a four-thousand line poem written sometime around 1400 - was part of a medieval Arthurian revival which produced such masterpieces as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Sir Thomas Malory's prose Morte D'Arthur.  Like Gawain, the poem survives in a unique manuscript (held in the library of Lincoln Cathedral) by an anonymous author, and written in alliterating lines which harked back to Anglo-Saxon poetic composition. Unlike Gawain, whose plot hinges around one moment of jaw-dropping magic, The Death of King Arthur deals in the cut-and-thrust of warfare and politics: the ever-topical matter of Britain's relationship with continental Europe, and of its military interests overseas.  The outcome is announced in the poem's title, and from their stronghold in Carlisle, Arthur and his army embark on a campaign which takes them almost to the gates of Rome, before he is forced to turn back to deal with matters closer to home. But along the way there are as many challenges for the translator of this poetic romance as are faced by its protagonist - not least how to manage the alliterative line while doing justice to the mass of riotous life which courses through the narrative's veins: channel crossings, battle formations, naval engagements, rearguard actions and forays; but also courtly protocols, partings, swoonings, and dream sequences remarkable for their private glimpses into the mind of the once and future king.  A new kind of actuality is present in The Death of King Arthur, whose chivalric code cannot gloss over the carnage and horror of war, or the flaws of a King who is as much a human being as a figurehead. Simon Armitage is already the master of this alliterative music, as his earlier version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (2006) so craftily showed. His new translation restores a neglected masterpiece of story-telling, bringing to life its entirely medieval mix of ruthlessness and restraint.

Early in the 20th century, black poets celebrated race consciousness in propagandistic and protest poetry, while World War I helped engender the outpouring of African-American creativity known as the ""Harlem Renaissance.""  The present volume spans this wealth of material, ranging from the religious and moral verse of Phillis Wheatley Peters (ca. 1753–1784) to the 20th-century sensibilities of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen. Also here are works by George Moses Horton, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Alberry Alston Whitman, Henrietta Cordelia Ray, Daniel Webster Davis, Mary Weston Fordham, James Weldon Johnson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, and many more.  Attractive and inexpensive, this carefully chosen collection offers unparalleled insight into the hearts and minds of African-Americans. It will be welcomed by students of the black experience in America and any lover of fine poetry.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Odanost zaumnim jezičkim suštinama, ""jezikoslovlju"" i hermetičnosti značenja, svrstavaju Stojanovića u mali i autohtoni krug pesnika koji poslednjih nekoliko decenija predstavljaju osnovnu kreativnu i umetničku snagu srpske poezije. Pesnikova ezoterična radoznalost preispituje oblikotvorne prauzroke sveta—Znak i Zrak; prve rušitelje i graditelje, primarne metafore postojanja, koje se u međuodnosima analogije i poricanja multiplikuju do večnih istina postojanja i trajanja nasuprot prolaznosti zemaljskih dana. Simboličko i transparentno, metafizičko i magijsko formiraju koncentrične krugove značenja koji svoju jedinstvenu elementarizaciju ostvaruju u odnosu na osnovna ljudska stremljenja; ka nebeskoj i božanskoj suštini ili opijajućim ponorima bezdana apsolutnog zaborava.  -Petar V. Arbutina  PRKOS TAMNIM SILAMA  Ako je tačno da poezijom, da poetičkim delom i činom struji čist vazduh, sa svojim iskošenim, zavodničkim pogledom, još je tačnije da pesnik ulazi u reč, logos, stih, metaforu, apostrofu, kliktanje ili ćutanje, sa svojom unutrašnjom energijom. Prema pitanjima filozofije života Dejan Stojanović nema direktne afinitete. Uprkos tome, postoji u njegovom pesničkom delu nešto iz štimunga, atmosfere, ""filinga"", pitanja ove vrste, koja pripadaju određenoj viziji početka i kraja, inicijacije i vaskrsenja; naročito je njegova poezija takva, solidarisanje sa bujičnim, primarnim životom, kao i čudesno osećanje zore i sutona, , svetlosti i senke, nemira i spokoja, tako da iz njegovog pretapanja proizlazi isti neumorni utisak vedrine u svetlo-tamnom ili svetloljubičastom. Ta neumorna, neiscrpna vedrina Dejanove poezije nije pijana, razuzdana pomama od života, nego je većma jedan etički i estetički ponos i prkos tamnim silama i zlim ljudima. Dakako, ova vrsta vitalizma je ukorenjena u humanom, lekarskom, takođe sudbinskom zadatku; jednoj visokoj, neusiljenoj misiji čoveka koji istinu nalazi među ljudima, a ne mimo ljudi, u staklenoj kuli sebičnog, lažnoromantičnog osećanja sveta drugih, ili po priviđenju jednog bez drugog, baš kao u pesmi ""Razonoda praznine"".                Svaki znak je zbir znakova               Nijedan nije potpuno sam               Praznina ne broji znake               U transu pred njima gubi pamćenje               Kakav su samo izvor zadovoljstva               Ustreptali i prodorni znaci               Beskrajna praznina               Sve ih lako prima ""Traganje za kompaktnijim i esncijalnijim odnosima izmedju poetskog iskaza i slike (simbola) uslovljava nove kvalitativne i stvaralačke akcente pesmotvoračkog zahvata Dejana Stojanovića u odnosu na dosadašnji poetski opus. Odanost zaumnim jezičkim suštinama, ""jezikoslovlju"" i hermetičnosti značenja, svrstavaju Stojanovića u mali i autohtoni krug pesnika koji poslednjih nekoliko decenija predstavljaju osnovnu kreativnu i umetničku snagu srpske poezije. Pesnikova ezoterična radoznalost preispituje oblikotvorne prauzroke sveta—Znak i Zrak; prve rušitelje i graditelje, primarne metafore postojanja, koje se u međuodnosima analogije i poricanja multiplikuju do večnih istina postojanja i trajanja nasuprot prolaznosti zemaljskih dana."" (Petar V. Arbutina)  Iza tih očiglednih biljega i veduta, nad kojima naoko usamljen bdi i smotri, bistro vidi i čisto sanja naš pesnik Dejan Stojanović, rasprostire se jedna neobična, koliko mitska toliko, do dnevnog reporterskog usklika, zemlja praotaca i potomaka, u istoj pesničkoj kantileni. Jer, to ćemo ponoviti, prostor je u Dejanovoj lirici pouzdan, a vreme je leprsavo, nepouzdano.  Zemlja je njegova prvočevina, a nebo je njegova tajna, mimezis, zagonetka. Zemlja jesam, podsećaće nas Stojanović na vrhovnu poemu, na lament Desanke Maksimović. Zemlja i dar očiju, mitsko i zavičajno tle, vladaju širokim magnetnim poljima knjige. Naoružan koracima po zemlji, pradedovskoj i ovoj, ništa manje suđenoj, današnjoj, pesnik vaznosi poglede, otkriva nebeske svetlosti, podiže ekumensko blago pogleda.  Svaka Dejanova pesma je pisana i očima i govorom tako da je vidokrug sve širi, a zenice sve dublje. Čak i minulim, mrtvim, usnulim stvarima i pejzažima, visinama i dolinama, toposima vraćaće izgubljenu energiju ili zatomljenu vodu vidarušu.  ""Znak i njegova deca"" je poetski utemeljena i simbolički dograđena knjiga stihova koji se susprežu po merama gradacije i po čvrstini konotacije. Ne opisujući suvišno, ne pevajući preglasno, on će omogućiti da udišemo mirise, da delimo ljubavi, da gledamo daleko, da dodirujemo blisko, da naokolo izbijaju pupoljci nepoznatog endemskog bilja, koji sa plodovima zemlje stižu na nebeske gozbe. Iz tamne pojmovne aure odjednom vrcaju i zasvetlucaju ozareni predeli i progovara ""krv hajdučka, duša devojačka"". Zalebdi u Dejanovoj lirici i nešto smesno i nešto bdesno, iz znaka u znak, iz zraka u zrak!  -Miroslav Mirković Buca  Ilustrovana politika, rubrika Čitati ili ne čitati, broj 2177, 7. X 2000.  SIMFONIJA ZNAKOVA ILI SKLADNA PORODICA  Dejan Stojanović od početka svoga pevanja pa do danas ostaje veran filozofskom pogledu na svet. Iako je njegova poezija u neprestanom odgonetanju postojanja i smisla, vrhunac svog približavanja filozofiji, a mogli bismo reći i poistovećivanja s njom, ona dostiže u zbirci ""Znak i njegova deca.""  Ova knjiga svoj prostor traži i nalazi u vremenu pre vremena—u iskonu, onda kad u početku bese Reč"".       Znak je reč      Deljenje znaka jeste deljenje reči      Dok je reč bila Jedno      Nije joj trebao jezik      Kada se izdelila      Započeo je razgovor      Znak sebe sluša               (""Reč i znak"") Pevanje o znaku i njegovoj deci moguće je objašnjenje sveta, postojanja i opstajanja, svedeno na začudjujuce malo komponenata. Glavnu ulogu igraju znak i (iliti) zrak. (""On stiže tamo /Gde zrak ne može da priviri""), noć i, ili, tama i prostor odnosno praznina—ništa (""I ništa je deo svega / Bez ništa sve bi bilo ništa""). Takođe je začuđujuće do koliko i kakvih sve značenja pesnik dolazi ukrštajući ove svoje osnovne elemente. A svi oni zajedno proizlaze iz jednog i jesu Jedno, jer ""Znak prebogat za Jedno / Nemilosrdno izdeli sebe"":       Jedno telo je znak      Drugo putokaz      Odstojanja među znacima      Raskršca      Kada se potpuno sažme      Ostaje sam i jedno                     (""Jedno"") Ova poezija je sva u paradoksima, ali paradoksima koji nisu smišljeni da bi nas šokirali neverovatnim sklopom krajnosti, već su tu da nas iznenade svojom dubokom logikom, u kojoj se krajnosti prirodno otkrivaju kao istovetnosti:        Nadnebni izroni zrak       ........................................       Oseti mir ugasle strasti       Sreću beznanja u konačnom saznanju       Bezbrigu i slast nemanja slasti       Nasuprot kretanju i umiranju                      (""Nadnebni znak"") I ništa ne štrči, ne bode uho, ne zvuči pretenciozno, što često može da se dogodi kada je ova vrsta poezije u pitanju, već se sve sliva i preliva jedno u drugo i sve je u svemu. Kao neka velika pesma vasione, u kojoj ima puno elemenata od drame kosmičkih razmera, ali koja se ipak pretvara u prefinjeni ples. U čarobnu lakocu muzike, ali i u otkrovenje koje istovremeno ostaje i tajna.  Ljubav je jedno od vrlo važnih znacenja ove knjige i njenih znakova:       Kako je srećan Vrhovni znak      Dok sebe gleda      U drugim znacima                       (""Porodica znakova"") Međutim, ljubav je data veoma široko, ona je i pojedinačna ali, gotovo uvek, i opšta (""Znak je jedno nebo / Znakom--drugim nebom--okruženo"" ili ""Noć bi bila sama / Da nema znaka koji je budi""), pre svega, to je ljubav zajednice, koja se kroz ljubav stvara i kroz nju postoji (""Svaki znak je zbir znakova / Nijedan nije potpuno sam"").  Zbirka ""Znak i njegova deca"" može se smatrati nekom vrstom kosmogonije, ona je svakako pesnikova najznakovitija knjiga, koja zahteva posebnu čitalacku pažnju i posvećenost, ali koja taj trud nagrađuje jednim neobičnim i vanrednim osećanjem jednostavnosti. Paradoksalno, ali u savršenom skladu sa poezijom o kojoj je reč.  To je i knjiga svojevrsne vedrine:       Znak je osmeh praznine      Kako je samo sama bez njega      Praznina koja se smeje      Probuđeni je znak                         (""Zrak i znak"") Pred nama je i knjiga mudrosti bitisanja i trajanja:       I odstojanja su deo reda      Oko znaka sve mirno s vrha gleda                         (""Oko znaka"") Ili:       Znaci se sudare ponekad      Uniste jedno drugo      ...........................................      Iz sudara dva znaka      Rađa se nov svemir znakova                          (""Sudar dva znaka"") Sledeći stihovi imaju u sebi i nesto od njegoševske upitanosti: ""Šta je covjek, a mora bit čovjek?"":       Nije lako biti Znak      Lakše je biti ništa                           (""Čuvari mira"") Suština znaka je u letu— ""Let je mera sveta"":       Nebo za nebom      Krilo za krilom      Život Znaka jeste let      Kad znak prestane da leti      Nestane nebo                           (""Znak i let"") Ali, da li Znak Dejana Stojanovića može prestati da postoji, da traje, da se preobražava u ništa i ponovo rađa iz ništa? U ovoj knjizi ima svega osim smrti. Kraj Znaka jednostavno ne postoji; ako nestane u jednom obliku, pojaviće se u drugom: ""Ništa i Znak su najbliži rod / Ljubavlju pretvoreni u jedno"".  Znaku sve služi: ""Tama nikada nije izneverila svetlost / Ona ponosno čeka"".  Zrak i nista igraju svoju večnu igru u večnoj potrazi jedno za drugim, to jest za samima sobom:       Ništa i znak opet se traže      Usna svetlog tela traži usnu mraka      Erotika zraka                           (""Ništa i Znak"") Zagledan u suštinu večnog, Dejan Stojanović nam svojom knjigom ""Znak i njegova deca"" nudi čitav spektar prinicljivih posmatranja i dubokih uvida. Pred nama je nasa vasionska kolevka (u kojoj ""Iako sve svuda žuri / Ništa nikuda ne ide"") i mogućnost da se bar na tren vratimo svom kosmičkom domu i osetimo da smo i sami jedan njegov znak, odnosno jedno od njegove, to jest, Znakovljeve dece. Jer, kako pesnik podseća:       I kad se izdeli      Ostaje Jedno      Sijanje i sejanje sebe      Sobom u sebe pada                           (""Znak i brzina""). -Nevena Vitošević  Književna reč, broj 513, februar 2001.  ZNAKOVI SMISLA  Središnja, ključna misao vodilja treće knjige pesama Dejana Stojanovića potpuno je obelodanjena u uvodnoj prilog pesmi ""Nadnebni znak"" kojom se otvara zbirka ""Znak i njegova deca."" Poput terazija, na jednom njenom tasu je misao sa težinom spoznaje tajne novog vida praiskona, odnosno njegovog, u svemu začetnog, znaka zametnutog u vaseljenskom vrtlogu. Pesma ""Nadnebni znak"" je kao belutak bačen u središte vode bezdane, odakle je ko zna kad i kako do kopna, do svetlosti, ili do dlana izronio. Nakon ponovnog dospeća do dna, odakle će samo svetlosnim zracima da se oglašava , javiće se između obala korica knjige pet koncentričnih krugova imenovanih kao ""Vrhovni znak"", ""Znak i ništa"", ""Lice znaka"", Reč i znak"" i ""Znak i san"", Poslednji, prividno najmanji, ali koji podlokava i razdire sve dubine Nevremora koje se igra tlom zemaljskim. Kako u prvom, tako i u svim potonjim poetskim krugovima, osim pojma Znak kojeg pesnik uvek ispisuje velikim slovom, javlja se i drugi, takođe sa značenjem ""Oblikotvornog prauzroka sveta kojeg preispituje pesnikova ezoterična radoznalost"" (zapažanje recenzenta Petra V. Arbutine). Reč je o Zraku sa ne samo metaforičkim značenjem graditelja i rusitelja. Zrak je, po Stojanoviću, ""osmeh praznine"", a ""Praznina koja se smeje / Probuđeni je znak"".  U drugom ciklusu, ""Znak i nista"", u središtu filozofsko-poetske opservacije jeste pojam ništavila ili nule. I nije reč o bezizlazu, jer ""Ništa je postojano samo dok Znak spava"". U ništa se i Vrhovni Znak pretvara, i to u trenu kada je najmoćniji. Bitno je istaći onu primarnu odrednicu kojom se Dejan Stojanović izdvaja iz mnoštva pesnika ne samo svoje generacije. Njegov lirski koncept, kojeg iz knjige u knjigu neprestano dograđuje, zasnovan je na kosmonizmu, filozofskom pogledu na svet, koji na vasionu, zajedno sa čovekom i svim sto je čovecansko, gleda kao na jedno veliko jedinstvo i celinu, a na duh kao na ogledanje vasione. Hipoteze Kanta i Laplasa o postanku sunčevog sistema, kosmogonija, a posebno ono mitsko i metafizičko u njoj što se odnosi na stvaranje i postanje sveta koji je ""celokupnost svih pojava u prostoru i vremenu"", sve je to poetski veoma uspešno utkano i u Stojanovićevim prethodnim knjigama, ""Krugovanje"" i ""Sunce sebe gleda"". Filozofsko često nadvlada ono lirsko, ali melodioznost i metaforicnost, u leksičkom pogledu bogata poezija Dejana Stojanovića, koji punu deceniju živi i stvara u Čikagu, čine ga lirikom-kosmosofistom koji nastavlja poetsku nit začetu lirskim krugovima Momčila Nastasijevića, Vaska Pope i Aleka Vukadinovića.  -David Kecman Dako  Borba, 15. 3. 2001.

This popular military history emphasizes two dimensions--the incompetence of the British generals, and their onslaught against Boer civilians. Farwell presents as the typical imperial commander Redvers H. Buller, a slow-witted tactician who repeatedly offered his troops as targets for the versatile Boers. Kitchener, the British hero, is seen chiefly as a butcher of non-combatants and a practitioner of scorched-earth warfare. The only British leader with talent, according to Farwell, was Lord Roberts, who demonstrated the potential of mobile war on the dusty veld. Basing his account partially on new documentary evidence, Farwell contends that 20,000 Boer children died in the filthy camps set up by the British. Even with this counter-insurgency tactic, the Queen's army was able to win only by massing huge forces of men and materiel and squandering them. For their part, the Boers were imaginative though xenophobic fighters, welcoming foreign weapons but accepting volunteer foreign troops mistrustfully. Their fight was rewarded, as Farwell tells it, by rehabilitation as police against the black Africans. An accessible and provocative account by the author of Queen Victoria's Little Wars (1973).

The woman who loves him is left scarred and haunted. In her fierce debut, Rebecca Lindenberg tells the story—in verse—of her passionate relationship with Craig Arnold, a much-respected poet who disappeared in 2009 while hiking a volcano in Japan. Lindenberg's billowing, ""I contain multitudes"" style lays bare the poet's sadnesses, joys, and longings in poems that are lyric and narrative, plainspoken and musically elaborate. Regarding her role in Arnold's story, Lindenberg writes: ""The girl with the ink-stained teeth / knows she's famous / in a tiny, tragic way. / She's not / daft, after all."" Then later, of her travels in Italy with the poet: ""The carabinieri / wanted to know if there were bears / in our part of America. Yes, we said, / many bears. Man-eating bears? Yes, of course, / many man-eating bears."" Every poem in this collection bursts with a unique, soulful voice.""   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|3 Have read

Dante and Augustine,Simone Marchesi,poetry,First published in 2011,/works/OL16625515W,/authors/OL5483100A/Simone_Marchesi,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  University of Toronto Press|Language English|Pages 251,"""At several junctures in his career, Dante paused to consider what it meant to be a writer. The questions he posed were both simple and wide-ranging: How does language, in particular 'poetic language,' work? Can poetry be translated? What is the relationship between a text and its commentary? Who controls the meaning of a literary work? In Dante and Augustine, Simone Marchesi re-examines these questions in light of the influence that Augustine's reflections on similar issues exerted on Dante's sense of his task as a poet.  Examining Dante's life-long dialogue with Augustine from a new point of view, Marchesi goes beyond traditional inquiries to engage more technical questions relating to Dante's evolving ideas on how language, poetry, and interpretation should work. In this engaging literary analysis, Dante emerges as a versatile thinker, committed to a radical defence of poetry and yet always ready to rethink, revise, and rewrite his own positions on matters of linguistics, poetics, and hermeneutics.""--pub. desc.

Through the voices of undocumented immigrants, border patrol agents, and scorned lovers, award-winning poet Eduardo C. Corral writes dramatic portraits of contradiction, survival, and a deeply human, relentless interiority. With extraordinary lyric imagination, these poems wonder about being unwanted or renounced. What do we do with unrequited love? Is it with or without it that we would waste away? In the sequence ""Testaments Scratched into Water Station Barrels,"" with Corral's seamless integration of Spanish and English, poems curve around the surfaces upon which they are written, overlapping like graffiti left by those who may or may not have survived crossing the border. A harrowing second collection, Guillotine solidifies Corral's place in the expanding ecosystem of American poetry.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Who would write a book for all the women, or all the men. The queers. How about all the people who died in the holocaust. What about all the people who didn't.

Tentativa del hombre infinito,Pablo Neruda,poetry,First published in 1926,/works/OL979760W,/authors/OL89930A/Pablo_Neruda,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English,"""Neruda's long-overlooked third book of poetry, critical in his poetic evolution, now translated into English for the very first time! Over twenty books by Pablo Neruda, the legendary Chilean poet and Nobel Laureate, have been translated into English, a testament to his enormous appeal. Yet, the work Neruda pointed to as 'one of the most important books of my poetry,' has been woefully neglected and remains virtually unknown. Venture of the Infinite Man was Neruda's third book, published in 1926, two years after his widely celebrated and still much beloved Twenty Love Poems. In a stark stylistic departure from the love poems, Neruda discarded rhyme, meter, punctuation and capitalization in an attempt to better capture the voice of the subconscious. In an epic poem comprised of fifteen cantos spread over 44 un-numbered pages, the Infinite Man sets forth on a virtual sleepwalk through time and space, on a quest to atone for his past and to rediscover himself. Neruda's readers were not prepared for this experiment, and Venture did not garner the reception Neruda had hoped for. Indeed, decades after its publication, he lamented that it remained 'the least read and least studied of all my work.' Venture is a strikingly clear example of a poet's creative and intellectual development, bridging the aching, plain lyricism of Love Poems, and the unique hermeticism of Neruda's next book, the landmark Residence on Earth. Neruda considered Venture essential to his evolution: 'Within its smallness and minimal expression, more than most of my works, it claimed, it secured, the path that I had to follow.' Its long-overdue translation into English is cause for celebration!""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the center of the book is a twelve-part narrative, Alice in the Wasteland,inspired by Lewis Carrolls great character and T.S. Eliots 1922 modernist poem. Alice is accosted by an invisible Voice as she wanders and wonders about the nature of language in relation to perception. In this volume, Lauterbach again shows the range of her formal inventiveness, demonstrating the visual dynamics of the page in tandem with the powerful musical cadences and imagery of a contemporary master.

In Ninety-fifth Street, Koethe retraces narratives from his life and moves across various landscapes he once inhabited; in his hands these stories and places become poems of beauty, feeling, and poignant candor. Disarmingly conversational and always accessible, these new poems offer the pleasures of a lucid intelligence and a distinctive poetic voice, by turns contemplative and worldly, lyrical, witty, and elegiac.

In this book, she uses poetry as a means of teaching black people about their history, heritage and culture.  These are lessons that were never taught in school.  Though many of her poems reveal the hardships people of color have endured, they were written to open people's eyes to the fact that blacks  are a strong race of people able to succeed against all odds, while at the same time contributing significantly to human progress.  She wrote this book with zealous devotion to people of African descent, in hopes of reminding them of their strengths, inspiring them to get back on track, and motivating them to strive to be all that God intended.

In John Yau's new collection, Borrowed Love Poems, the reader encounters artists (Hiroshige and Eva Hesse), poets (Marina Tsvetayeva and Georg Trakl), actors (Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre), and memorable figures (a retired wrestler and a private eye named Genghis Chan). Each becomes a spectral, sonorous presence inhabiting the polymorphic body of the page, a shadow of a shadow lit from within. Yau's poems are dazzling explorations of the multiple, shifting sands of identity, of the fictional, fake, factual, and autobiographical selves that pass like ghosts through the empty space known as ""I."" Able to seamlessly merge a strict yet eccentric methodology with wild flights of the imagination, Yau moves into a rich, complex realm, where the flickering edges of consciousness-the dream state-become poetry.

Probing the tension between 'The Elevated' and the 'Falls,' she explores troubled love and relationships, the danger of accident and emotional volatility. At the heart of the book is a dream triptych which retells the same encounter from different perspectives, the drama between the narrative described and the sexual tension created there. The Nightlife demonstrates Paschen's versatility and formal mastery as she experiments with forms such as the pantoum, the villanelle and the tritina, as well as concrete poems and poems in free verse. Throughout this poetry collection, she interweaves lyric and narrative threads, creating a contrapuntal story-line.

Whether a militia in Libya or a military base in Baghdad, a shantytown in East Africa or an opulent mall on Long Island, these subjects and locations resonate with the psychic and social costs of having let the genie of war, famine, and climate change out of the lamp in the first place. The book ultimately turns on conundrums of selfhood and self-estrangement in which Sleigh urges us toward a different realm, where we might achieve the freedom of spirit to step outside our own circumstances, however imperfectly, and look at ourselves as other, as unfamiliar, as strange.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Inspired by the example of William Stafford, Bly decided to embark on the project of writing a daily poem: Every morning he would stay in bed until he had completed the day's work.  These 'little adventures/In Morning longing,' as he calls them, address classic poetic subjects (childhood, the seasons, death and heaven) in a way that capitalizes fully on the pun in the book's title.  These are morning poems, full of the delight and mystery of waking in a new day, and they also do their share of mourning, elegizing the deceases and capturing the 'moment of sorror before creation.'  Some of the poems are dialogues where unconventional speakers include mice, maple trees, bundles of grain, the body, the 'oldest mind' and the soul.  A particularly moving sequence involves Bly's imaginative transactions with a great and unlikely precursor, Wallace Stevens.  The whole is a fascinating and original book from one of our most fascinating authors."" -- David Lehman   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They will also and always be a row of gallows from which Black bodies once swung. This is an image that she cannot escape, but one that she has learned to lean into as she delves into personal and public histories, explicating memories and muses around race, elegy, family, and faith by making and breaking forms as well as probing mythology, literary history, her own ancestry, and, yes, even Rihanna. I Can't Talk About the Trees without the Blood, because Tiana cannot engage with the physical and psychic landscape of the South without seeing the braided trauma of the broken past--she will always see blood on the leaves.""--Publisher's website.

In theory, we all pursue life seeking some form of validation. What cultivates uniqueness? What empowerment can we offer the world? How can we improve ourselves? These questions have sent me on a provocative journey- The Poetic Zeal.  This literature is presented in five categories. The first chapter illustrates self- reckoning. In my teen years my mother would always tell me, ""Son, success is not determined by where you come from- it's about where you are going.""  Mothers it seems know best. However once in college, I put a slight twist to her saying. I have a faith that success is not only measured by where one is going or from. It's about what you want in life and the desire to achieve goals will ultimately lead you to the success.  Sometimes life's experience has led me to believe that sticking with the program and staying where you are was the virtuous act. In my continued battle of that assertion, I come to the conclusion that the threat of regression is greater than the fear of subjection. Nevertheless, I've acquired the instinct to accept trails and tribulations of the past as a lesson, while acknowledging the present and forgoing the future.  Expressions in Japanese calligraphy (Shodou) are great examples of poetic method. The Western absorption of this art influenced the development of haiku. Haikus are a structure of three stanzas with a distinct set of syllables (respectively 5, 7, and 5.) In relevance to the facets of form, the second chapter of this book features a composition of haiku's. The third chapter addresses the predominating and prevalent issues within society. Life in the ghetto was a growing pain (i.e. frequent candle lit shrines, the infeasibility of educational and economic advancement and the ever present dilemma of identity.)  Initially I had reservations not to include societal topics in my work. I thought harping on controversial issues would diminish from the art of poetry and could project as condemning. The focus of this section is not to condemn but to shed light on the neglected corners of society. For the most part, I believe the overall struggle for a democratic livelihood is something we all should aspire to achieve.  The third part of this manuscript acknowledges war and pays tribute to the sacrifices thereof. As an Iraqi war veteran I've experience close hand the impact in fighting overseas and can identify with its affect. Leadership within our system of government is a constant balancing act. Despite political turmoil and its mandates of approach, our service members are the true granters' of the free world.  The deliverance of former Vice-President Al Gore warns that our planet has a fever. In figurative sense our subtle differences and worldly conflicts fueled through prejudice, greed, pride and profits contributed to this infection. In fact they are the infection. But whatever happened to compassion? The final part of this manuscript is my take on empathy and the arts. Parts of this section are sensually expressive while others are morsels of artistry.

He teaches at Washington University in St. Louis. Phillips here creates a shadowy inner landscape, one where the field is the heart, and the heart itself has a beautifully yet often treacherously flawed darkness that each of us--believing in the possibility of light--seeks to penetrate.  Examining how to fill and fulfill the life granted us--how to realize the self entirely, and in time--these rhythmically sequenced meditations circle the predicaments of our longing against the formal backdrop of pastoral tradition. How do we balance control and abandonment when making poetry? Or when making a life with another person? How do we reconcile fleshly desire and spiritual intention? Tightly coherent and emotionally nuanced, ""Pastoral"" enlarges--and also defines--Phillips's already impressive poetic landscape.  ""Desire--erotic and spiritual--courses passionately through this collection: the strict shape desire inflicts on the chaos desire lets loose. But Phillips addresses not only passion, but art, history, nature: all, in his hands, are forms of wanting. His rhythms are beautifully and powerfully various--sinewy, majestic, casual, adamant--as he modulates from honesty to honesty like no one else; [this book] both trusts and beautifully second-guesses appearances with an accuracy that moves and amazes.""-- Jorie Graham    ""In this brilliant fourth collection, foreboding fields and roaming creatures [both] echo the sorrow, alienation, and eros of bodily existence.""--""Publishers Weekly"" (starred review)   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These men of vision, brought to life in the majestic paintings of artist Kadir Nelson, lived at a time when the color of their skin dictated where they could live, what schools they could attend, and even where they could sit on a bus or in a movie theater.  Yet in the face of this tremendous adversity, these dedicated souls and others like them not only demonstrated the importance of Black culture in America, but also helped issue in a movement that ""changed the world."" Their lives and their works inspire us to this day, and serve as a guide to how we approach the challenges of tomorrow.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Beginning with a painting done in 2003, the poems move backwards in time to 1 BC, where an architectural fragment is painted on an architectural fragment, highlighting visual art’s strange relationship between the image and the thing itself. The total effect is exhilarating—a wholly original, personal take on art history coupled with Bang’s sly and elegant commentary on poetry’s enduring subjects: Love, Death, Time and Desire. The recipient of numerous prizes and awards, Bang stands at the front of American poetry with this new work, asking more of the English language, and enticing and challenging the reader.

In an extraordinarily powerful mix of poetry and prose, Rosner traces the earliest remembered resonances of her parents' past and her dawning awareness of the war history that colored her family home during her youth in Schenectady, New York. She recounts her false starts in raising the subject with her father (a survivor of Buchenwald concentration camp), his piecemeal revelations, and their eventual travels together to the sites of the nightmare in Germany. And she evokes, courageously and heart-wrenchingly, her own search for identity against the gravitational pull of her parents' experience and the traditional upbringing they've given her. GRAVITY reminds us that three-quarters of a century is a blink of an eye, that history happens at home, and that the past is something we all embody, knowingly or not.

Jonathan Mayhew first offers a critical analysis of the called 'poetry of experience' of Luis García Montero, a tendency that is based on the supposed obsolescence of the modernist poetics of the first half of the century. While the 'poetry of experience' presents itself as a progressive attempt to 'normalise' poetry, to make it accessible to the common reader, Mayhew views it as a reactionary move that ultimately reduces poetry to the status of a minor genre. The author then turns his attention to the poetry of José Angel Valente and Antonio Gamoneda, whose poetry embodies the continuation of modernism, and to the work of younger women poets of the last two decades of the twentieth century. Throughout this controversial and provocative book, Mayhew challenges received notions about the value of poetic language in relation to the larger culture and society. It turns out that the cultural ambition of modernist poetics is still highly relevant even in an age in which more cynical views of literature seem prevalent. Ultimately, Mayhew writes as an advocate for the survival of more challenging and ambitious modes of poetic writing in the postmodern age.

As in his breakthrough work, Copacetic, Komunyakaa writes again of music as muse―from a blues club in the East Village to the shakuhachi of Basho. Beginning with ""Canticle,"" this varied new collection often returns to the idea of poem as hymn, ethereal and haunting, as Komunyakaa reveals glimpses of memory, myth, and violence. With contemplations that spring up along walks or memories conjured by the rhythms of New York, Komunyakaa pays tribute more than ever before to those who came before him.  The book moves seamlessly across cultural and historical boundaries, evoking Komunyakaa's capacity for cultural excavation, through artifact and place. The Chameleon Couch begins in and never fully leaves the present―an urban modernity framed, brilliantly, in pastoral-minded verse. The poems seek the cracks beneath the landscape, whether New York or Ghana or Poland, finding in each elements of wisdom or unexpected beauty. The collection is sensually, beautifully relaxed in rhetoric; in poems like ""Cape Coast Castle,"" Komunyakaa reminds us of his gift for combining the personal with the universal, one moment addressing a lover, the next moving the focus outward, until both poet and reader are implicated in the book's startling world.  The Chameleon Couch is a finalist for the 2011 National Book Award for Poetry.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|2 Currently reading|0 Have read

We now change them again to suit ourselves. Songs and Stories of the Ghouls purports to give power to the dead--voices to the victims of genocide both ancient and contemporary--and presence to women. Medea did not kill her sons; Dido founds a city, over and over again, the city of the present author's poetry. In these poems the poet asserts that though her art comes from a tradition as broken as Afghanistan's statuary, there is always a culture to pass on to one's children, and one is always involved in doing so. We are the ghouls, the drinkers of the blood-sacs, and we insist that we are alive.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While many of the poems are perceived via a persona, it is ultimately the personae of perception that proscribe the pure pleasure of reading. Committed to the eye and the ear, Uttermost Paradise Place sounds a music of syllables, repetitions, recurrences, and duration. As judge Claudia Keelan writes in her introduction, “Laura McKee creates a poetics of call and response, but not in the traditional sense, as in poet to reader, chorus leader to singers, etc. These poems call to each other, syllable by syllable, and they are so pleased with their circuitry of sound and sense that readers — if they just give themselves away to the pleasure of being exactly nowhere but in the unscripted place all authentic poetry provides — will experience the paradise the book proposes.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An indispensable and historic volume, Inclined to Speak gathers together poems, from the most important contemporary Arab American poets, that shape and alter our understanding of this experience. These poems also challenge us to reconsider what it means to be American. Impressive in its scope, this book provides readers with an astonishing array of poetic sensibilities, touching on every aspect of the human condition. Whether about culture, politics, loss, art, or language itself, the poems here engage these themes with originality, dignity, and an unyielding need not only to speak, but also to be heard. Here are thirty-nine poets offering up 160 poems. Included in the anthology are Naomi Shihab Nye, Samuel Hazo, D. H. Melhem, Lawrence Joseph, Khaled Mattawa, Mohja Khaf, Matthew Shenoda, Kazim Ali, Nuar Alsadir, Fady Joudah, and Lisa Suhair Majaj. Charara has written a lengthy introduction about the state of Arab American poetry in the country today and short biographies of the poets and provided an extensive list of further readings.
