Toward a theory of patronage,Louis Kaiser Epstein,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL31444796W,/authors/OL11459825A/Louis_Kaiser_Epstein,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Language English|Pages 356,"This dissertation illuminates the funding contexts that structured art music composition in interwar France. While music historiography tends to focus solely on patronage - an ill-defined and limited category - as the paradigmatic economy within which pre-paid composition takes place, the author brings patronage into conversation with other, similarly enabling funding sources: publishing, radio, film, orchestras, and ballet companies. Through a series of case studies of the individuals, institutions, and practices that provided a market for interwar French art music, this thesis pursues two central ideas: first, that musical works, genres, and styles present sonic traces of the economic forces that structured their composition, and second, that the funding context of music often determines its historiographical reception.

Sie lebten mit dem Thomaskantor unter einem Dach, halfen ihm beim Herstellen von Notenmaterial und bewältigten die Uraufführungen seiner anspruchsvollen Kantaten und Passionen. Ihre Bedeutung als Zeugen für Bachs Kirchenmusik ist deshalb kaum zu überschätzen.0Aus Anlass des 800-jährigen Jubiläums des Thomanerchores startete das Bach-Archiv Leipzig 2012 ein einzigartiges Forschungsprojekt, das sich zum ersten Mal systematisch allen Bach-Thomanern widmete. Als ein Ergebnis dieser grossangelegten Studie liegt nun dieses Buch vor. Es verschafft einen Überblick über die Schicksale aller 306 Chormitglieder aus der Ära Bach und stellt einen umfassenden Datenfundus bereit. Darüber hinaus werden ausgewählte Thomaner-Biographien individuell gewürdigt und somit ein vielschichtiges Portrait des mitteldeutschen Kantors? jenseits der Überfigur Bach? entworfen.

This collective work is the fruit of several years of largely unpublished research on the musical life of these institutions, considered for the first time as a whole.What it primarily brings to light is the common model which emerged from the interactions between the national churches, as well as between these and other Roman churches, in musical matters - eloquent example of a unifying cultural paradigm. The repertories used by these churches, the ceremonies and celebrations they orchestrated in the 'teatro del mondo' which Rome constituted at the time, their role in the placing of musicians within the city's professional networks are just some of the themes explored in this work. The cultural exchanges between the national churches and the ""nations"" that they represented in the pontifical city form another important area of investigation: whether musical or devotional, connecting places of worship and private palaces or extending from one side of the Alps to the other, these exchanges reveal the permeability that characterised many national traditions. At the heart of this richly illustrated study are two fundamental lines of inquiry: the first concerns the processes of identity construction developed by communities installed in foreign lands, the second line of inquiry is cultural hybridity. In pursuing these, we aim to further understanding of the dialectics of exchange at work in Rome during the modern period.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is not an hour of entertainment. It is a time to worship God in spirit and in truth. In the Christian realm, however, the worship service seems to be a musical battleground. On one hand, church music is seen as utilitarian. Its only purpose is to allow worship to begin or continue throughout a church service. On the other hand, music can exist purely for entertainment. But is a worship service the place for entertainment? Shouldn't a worship service be designed only to worship God? A Philosophy of Church Music presents an integrated look at church music. Theological, philosophical, and psychological responses to the question of appropriate and consistent church music are considered to assist you in developing your personal church music philsophy. - Jacket.

J.C.),Jean Claude Sillamy,music,First published in 1991,/works/OL6499250W,/authors/OL1729867A/Jean_Claude_Sillamy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Publisher  s.n.corinne mattéï . Le sicile E. res des Ïles. 20000 Ajaccio France|Language French|Pages 74,"On a tendance à projeter les découvertes faites sur le piano au début du XIXè siècle par Pleyel et Erard  dans un passé lointain antique. Or il y a 4000 ans le piano forté n'existait pas car le bronze n'avait pas été découvert. Tous les pianos que l'on fabriquait en bois à 5 octaves et demi ou à 6 octaves, sans armature de bronze, se brisaient en deux sous la pression des nombreuses cordes.    Les grosses et longues flûtes de l'antiquité ne dépassaient pas la quinte; lorsqu'elles atteignaient laborieusement la sixte mineure, c'était une révolution. Et c'est à l'intérieur de leur gros tube que naissaient des modes différents aux sons multiples plus ou moins parallèles qui correspondaient à cet ""embrouillamini"" sonore dont parlaient les anciens et que personne n' a jamais bien compris.    Parallèlement, en 2650 avant Jésus_Christ la double flûte en argent du cimétière royal d'Ur ne dépassait pas le pentacorde:    UT - RE -MI - FA # - SOL.    Aussi, dès que l'on a voulu faire endosser à la musique de l'Antiquité, le vêtement trop large et trop grand de notre musique occidentale, les savants se sont heurtés à des difficultés insurmontables. Ils se sont découragés et ont abandonné leurs recherches.  Le 71ème chercheur : Jean-Claude Sillamy, archéomusicologue a continué seul le combat et a triomphé de toutes les difficultés en présence.    Ainsi, il fallait quitter le piano et expérimenter sur des instruments anciens voire antiques qui présentaient des particularités musicales disparues depuis longtemps en Occident. Jean-Claude Sillamy a tourné ses regards vers l'Asie, l'Afrique, l'Inde, la Chine, l'Indonésie et le Japon qui ont conservé jusqu'à nos jours les instruments anciens étranges sur lesquels il a expériementé.

The Who Sell Out (33 1/3),John Dougan,music,First published in 2006,/works/OL6040896W?edition=ia%3Awhosellout00doug,/authors/OL1519697A/John_Dougan,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8167996M-M.jpg,"Publish Date September 15, 2006|Publisher  Continuum International Publishing Group|Language English|Pages 131","Released in the U.S. in January 1968, The Who Sell Out was, according to critic Dave Marsh, a complete backfire--the album sold well, but not spectacularly [and was] ultimately a nostalgic in-joke: Who but a pop intellectual could appreciate such a thing? Further rarifying its in-joke status was its unapologetic Englishness; 13 tracks stitched together in a mock pirate radio broadcast, without a DJ, with cool, anglocentric commercials to boot. In the 36 years since its release, Sell Out, though still not the best selling release in The Who's catalog, has been embraced by a growing number of fans who regard it as the band's best work, one of the few recordings of the late 1960s that best represents the ambitious aesthetic possibilities of the concept album without becoming mired in a bog of smug, self-aggrandizing, high art aspirations. Sell Out, powerfully and ecstatically, articulates the nexus of pop music and pop culture.  As much as it is an expression of the band's expanding sonic palette, Sell Out also functions as a critique of the rock and roll lifestyle. Not the clichéd mantra of sex, drugs, and rock and roll but in the ways that commercial advertising fabricates a youth-oriented cultural reality by hawking pimple cream, deodorant, food, musical equipment, etc., and linking it with rock and roll. In this sense Sell Out is a reflective work, one that struggles with rock and roll as a cultural expression that aspires to aesthetic permanence while marketed as ephemera. From this conflict emerges a pop art masterpiece.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the kings and queens of England, a trumpet fanfare or crash of cymbals could be as vital a weapon as a cannon. Showcasing a monarch's power, prestige and taste, music has been the lifeblood of many a royal dynasty. Works like Handel's Water music and Tallis' Mass for four voices can be seen as more than entertainment-- they were pieces signalling political intent, wealth and ambition. Starkey examines England's most iconic musical works to demonstrate how political power has been a part of musical composition for centuries. Many of our current musical motifs of nationhood, whether it's the last night of the Proms or football terraces erupting in song, have their origins in the way the crown has shaped the national soundtrack.

The Mandolin in America,Walter Carter,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL20050864W,/authors/OL432038A/Walter_Carter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 151,"When large numbers of students from Spain arrived in New York in 1880, they introduced the American public to a new instrument the mandolin. Spanning more than a century, this book chronicles the national mandolin craze that swept across the nation and the evolution of the instrument in America to the present day. Eclipsing the banjo and guitar as the most popular fretted instrument in the late 19th century, the mandolin inspired the formation of the Gibson company. After World War I, the mandolin went into a long period of decline, during which it found sanctuary in rural string bands and bluegrass music. By the 1980s, a revival was underway, with adventurous players using mandolins in all types of musical settings, including symphonic, semi-classical ensembles, jazz, klezmer, Irish, choro, and all the branches emanating from bluegrass. The Mandolin in America profiles all the significant makers, including Bigsby, Epiphone, Fender, Flatiron, Giacomel, Gibson, Gilchrist, Lyon & Healy, Martin, Monteleone, National, Nugget, Vega, Vinaccia, and Washburn. Lavishly illustrated with color photos throughout, this is a must-have volume for collectors and music enthusiasts alike.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Under the direction of producer T-Bone Burnett, the stage band includes Jackson Browne, Burnett, Elvis Costello, k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt, J.D. Souther, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits and Jennifer Warnes, along with the rhythm section from Elvis Presleys fabled late 60s and early 70s touring band. That astonishing lineup is all the more noteworthy for the restraint with which they collaborate. Its evident that those superstars came to honor Orbison, not upstage him, resulting in a gratifying cohesion of the performances.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jahrhunderts. Als Nachfolger Eduard Hanslicks bei der Neuen Freien Presse (Wien) einer der wichtigsten und einflussreichsten Kritiker seiner Zeit, erbitterter, ja fanatischer Gegner der ?Wiener Schule? und aller Tendenzen der ?Neuen Musik?, wurde ausgerechnet er 1897 zum Vater eines komponierenden Wunderkindes: Erich Wolfgang Korngold.0Mit der Atonalen Götzendämmerung wollte Julius Korngold 1937 die Summe seiner journalistischen Tätigkeit ziehen, doch der ?Anschluss? Österreichs verhinderte das Erscheinen des Buches. Seither galt es als verschollen, bis beim Wiener Verlag Doblinger ein Korrekturexemplar mit handschriftlichen Eintragungen des Autors ans Licht kam. Dieses Korrekturexemplar wird hier als Faksimile präsentiert und mit Vorwort und Kommentar sowie einem detaillierten Anmerkungsapparat ergänzt, der die in den Band eingegangenen Zeitungsartikel nachweist und somit kenntlich macht, wie Julius Korngold den anlassgebundenen Tagesjournalismus in allgemeines ästhetisches Räsonnement verwandelte.

Dem Zusammenwirken dieser unterschiedlichen Facetten entspricht der inter- bzw. transdisziplinäre Zugang des Autors dieses Bandes, des Sprachwissenschaftlers, ausgebildeten Sängers, Essayisten und Musikdramaturgen Oswald Panagl. Seine Essays, die über die Jahre entstanden sind, versammeln sich hier zu einem kenntnisreichen, unprätentiösen und funkelnden Kaleidoskop des modernen Musiktheaters, das seinen Ausgang bei den Komponisten Puccini, Busoni und Debussy nimmt. Der Bogen der beleuchteten Werke reicht bis etwa 1950, zu Opern von Komponisten wie Weill und Britten. Im Zentrum der Darstellung stehen Richard Strauss, Pfitzner, Puccini und Janácek; der nach stilistischen und kulturnationalen Kriterien gesteckte Rahmen sieht auch Bühnenstücke von Schönberg, Schreker, Bartók, Prokofjew und Enescu vor.

Further, the variety and range of musical     instruments and confluence of Indian Classical Music and Miniature Painting     have been illustrated with a view to enunciating the all-important aspect     of the thematic content of the Raga.

With Muhly, singer/lyricist Sufjan Stevens, the National guitarist Bryce Dessner, and drummer James McAlister receiving equal credit for the music, it also features a string quartet, seven trombonists, a keyboardist, and numerous instrument credits, including synths and programming, by the co-composers. Inspired by the Solar System, Planetarium's 17 tracks are named after celestial objects and related phenomena, with Stevens' often enigmatic lyrics focusing on the subjects of science and Greek and Roman mythology"" --Allmusic.com.

The styles in which they sang have proved hugely influential to generations of popular singers, from the wholesale adoptions of singers like Robert Cray or James Brown, to the subtler vocal appropriations of Mariah Carey. Their own music, and how it operates, is not, however, always seen as valid in its own right. This book provides an overview of both these genres, which worked together to provide an expression of twentieth-century black US experience. Their histories are unfolded and questioned; representative songs and lyrical imagery are analysed; perspectives are offered from the standpoint of the voice, the guitar, the piano, and also that of the working musician. The book concludes with a discussion of the impact the genres have had on mainstream musical culture.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I felt there was a gap, not in the market but in our understanding: how we got from Alfred Hill's 'Waiata Poi' to Rim D. Paul's 'Poi Poi Twist' seemed to be a mystery.  For my purposes, 'popular music' is a genre, not a description. Also popular in this period -  the mid-twentieth century - were brass bands, bagpipers and choirs. But they are hardly mentioned in this book, which looks at the evolution of modern popular music as an industry: the changes in musical fashions, technology and social mores.

Neo-Riemannian theory has proven particularly adept at explaining features of chromatic music where other theoretical approaches have failed, and thereby established itself as the leading theoretical approach of our time. The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Riemannian Music Theories brings together an international group of leading proponents of Riemannian and neo-Riemannian theory for a thoroughgoing exploration of the music-analytical, systematic, and historical aspects of this important new field. The volume elucidates key aspects of the field, draws connections between Riemann's original ideas and current thought, and suggests new applications and avenues for further study. A number of essays suggest connections to other fields of inquiry, such as cognitive and mathematical music theory, as well as applications in the field of metric or melodic analysis. The selection of essays is complemented by several of Hugo Riemann's key original texts, many of which appear in English translation for the first time, and is rounded off by a glossary of key concepts for easy reference. - Publisher.

Les encanta cantar, oír cantar, seguir un ritmo, danzar y dar vueltas al corro al compás de una tonada. La capacidad de placer por la música aumenta al tenor de la preparación que el niño recibe. Como todas las demás introducciones al mundo de la cultura y del espíritu, la sensibilización musical debe hacerse de forma gradual, partiendo de fragmentos musicales breves, fáciles de aprender y de seguir.  Hay una música especialmente adaptada a los niños en la que tiene una importancia especial el ritmo. Sabemos lo sensibles que son todos ellos a los sones ritmados — desde las canciones de cuna a los juegos de corro — y por este motivo las canciones de ritmo muy marcado y de tonada y letra muy simple son las más indicadas para servir de introducción. Los niños podrán cantarlas y también seguirlas con palmadas, con juegos de ritmo e incluso danzarías y mimarlas.  Es importante que las escuelas se propongan en serio dar una base de cultura musical a sus alumnos a fin de enriquecerles personalmente y de aumentar el nivel colectivo de nuestro país, tan bajo en este sentido. No podemos hacernos ilusiones por los éxitos que obtienen algunos grupos minoritarios en certámenes internacionales. Debemos reconocer que son el resultado de una entrega casi heroica y de una lucha interminable contra los innumerables obs táculos — económicos, falta material de tiempo y de locales de reunión, coste de viajes culturales y de expansión, etc.— que se interponen a todo esfuerzo de superación llevado a término por grupos...

This work is an humble capitulation of the author's addoration of the great tradition of music that evolved with all its glory in Kalinga, Utkala and Udra, now called Odishi.

Kahn Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Music at the University of Pennsylvania, a seminal figure in the field of music theory, and a path breaking scholar in music cognition. The studies range widely in subject and approach, just as Narmour's work demonstrates impressive mastery in an imposing array of disciplines, including, beyond his own training in music theory, art history, cognitive studies, linguistics, and psychology. Fittingly, therefore, these essays draw upon cognitive, historical, performative, philosophical, style-analytical, and theoretical models.""

Global scholarship, however, has been slow in examining this seminal genre. In this pioneering book, ethnomusicologist James Mitchell explores the many facets of luk thung through ethnographic research with singers, songwriters, fans, and other professionals. The groundbreaking final chapter refutes the widespread opinion that luk thung is an apolitical genre by examining its role in recent political turmoil and tracing currents of protest and sociopolitical commentary back to the music's origins.""

He drove a rental car from New York to Rhode Island to Georgia to Mississippi to Iowa to Minneapolis to Fargo to Seattle, and he chased death and rock 'n' roll all the way. Within the span of twenty-one days, Chuck had three relationships end--one by choice, one by chance, and one by exhaustion. The road is hard. From the Chelsea Hotel to the swampland where Lynyrd Skynyrd's plane went down to the site where Kurt Cobain blew his head off, Chuck explored every brand of rock star demise. He wanted to know why the greatest career move any musician can make is to stop breathing...and what this means for the rest of us.--From publisher description.

Often overshadowed by the beat, bluster, and hype surrounding the music, lyrics are the heart of hip hop. Book of Rhymes explores America's least-understood poets by unpacking their complex craft and according them the respect they deserve as lyricists. Examining the language and techniques of hip hop's most memorable artists, literary scholar Adam Bradley argues that a new world of rhythm and rhyme awaits us if we put aside preconceptions and encounter rap with new ears and new eyes. Updated to reflect nearly a decade of the genre's evolution, Book of Rhymes remains the definitive work on the poetry of hip hop""--Page 4 of cover.

It explores the influence of emergent nations and nationalism on the development of classical music in Europe and North America and examines the distinctive themes, sounds and resonances to be found in the repertory of each of the nations. Its scope is broad, extending well beyond the period 1848-1914 when national music flourished most conspicuously. The interplay of music and nation encompasses the oratorios of Handel, the open-air music of the French Revolution and the orchestral works of Beethoven and Mendelssohn and extends into the mid-twentieth century in the music of Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Copland. The book addresses the representation of the national community, the incorporation of ethnic vernacular idioms into art music, the national homeland in music, musical adaptations of national myths and legends, the music of national commemoration and the canonisation of national music.""

Music of a Thousand Years,Ann E. Lucas,music,,/works/OL20926587W,/authors/OL8010425A/Ann_E._Lucas,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  University of California Press|Language English|Pages 288,"""Iran?s particular system of traditional Persian art music has been long treated as the product of an ever-evolving, ancient Persian culture. In Music of a Thousand Years, Ann E. Lucas argues that this music is a modern phenomenon indelibly tied to changing notions of Iran?s national history. Rather than considering a single Persian music history, Lucas demonstrates cultural dissimilarity and discontinuity over time, bringing to light two different notions of music-making in relation to premodern and modern musical norms. An important corrective to the history of Persian music, Music of a Thousand Years is the first work to align understandings of Middle Eastern music history with current understandings of the region?s political history.    ?Ann E. Lucas very effectively combines historical analysis, ethnomusicology, and musicology to provide a broad, holistic explanation for complex, nuanced processes of change. Well written and highly original in its approach, this is a major contribution to the field.? KAMRAN SCOT AGHAIE, Associate Professor of Iranian History, University of Texas    ?Music of a Thousand Years presents an innovative narrative of Persian music history and also provides important new perspectives on how to analyze the meaning of music and culture in historical perspective.? MOHSEN MOHAMMADI, Lecturer in Ethnomusicology, University of California, Los Angeles    ?Lucas turns the standard history of Persian music on its head, proving it is not a story of the survival of an ancient tradition, but rather the story of the invention of tradition. Revisionist in the best sense of the word.? JAMES L. GELVIN, author of The Modern Middle East: A History    ANN E. LUCAS is Assistant Professor of ethnomusicology in the Department of Music at Boston College, where she also teaches in the Islamic Civilizations and Societies Program.

I live in England, sing tenor, play the organ, have visited all but 2 Cathedrals, regularly email organists, masters of choristers, researchers, organ builders.   We in England - at great and pains-taking expense - are just beginning to see a little beyond what JBC wrote back in 1974.   Basically, from 1460s-1640s, the ancient Britons sang to an organ which had C/F as the lowest note (sounding around 100Hz, the bottom note of a rank of 5ft open flues).   We have music going back to earlier days (where folk used a C-based organ and an F-based organ) and this is enough to drive us mad, let alone the stout visiting guy JBC.   The lad did damn well.   Still worth a read.   Only serious error is he thought the case at King's Cambridge was 1605-6 original;  it's half a century later.

With stunning candor, he writes about the general managers he worked under, his embattled rise to the top, the maneuverings of the blue-chip board, and his masterful approach to making a family of such artist-stars as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Teresa Stratas, and Renee Fleming, and such visionary directors as Franco Zeffirelli, Robert Wilson, and Julie Taymor. Intimate and frank, The Toughest Show on Earth is not only essential for music lovers, but for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of the culture business.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Like its companion volume, Way Beyond Compare: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume One, 1957--1965, this unique work thoroughly chronicles all known and available Beatles recordings during this period of incredible creative growth.Have you ever watched a Beatles film clip and wondered:-  Where was that filmed?-  Is any more of that footage available?Have you ever heard a Beatles interview and asked:-  When was that taped?-  Where's the best place to find the complete recording?That Magic Feeling answers these and thousands of similar questions. With more than 500 entries, it includes recording sessions, concerts, newsreel footage, press clips, TV and film performances, home movies, radio interviews, documentaries, studio outtakes, home demos, and alternative mixes--all of which are given complete coverage for the first time.Author John C. Winn has spent two decades poring over, scrutinizing, organizing, and analyzing hundreds of hours of audio and video recordings and compiling them into a digestible chronological framework, creating the ultimate reference guide to the Beatles' legendary musical and cultural evolution.From the Trade Paperback edition.

His band Mudcrutch was a household name in his hometown of Gainesville, Florida, in the mid-1970s, but the band self-destructed just months after moving to Los Angeles in search of a record deal. Tom Petty and former Mudcrutch alums Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench then regrouped with Gainesville ex-pats Stan Lynch and Ron Blair to form Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers in 1976. The new group fought to build an audience only to endure conflict with the record label, which caused Petty to go bankrupt before emerging from a scathing lawsuit with the sweeping anthems - 'Refugee' and 'Don't Do Me Like That' - that catapulted the band's third album Damn The Torpedoes to multi-Platinum status. Tom Petty: Rock 'n' Roll Guardian is the first intimate portrait of one of the most enduring figures on rock'n'roll's world stage. Petty is the ultimate underdog that made good and his honest approach to the craft of songwriting has brought him the respect of music industry insiders and fans alike.

Their embodiment in music is the veritable bedrock upon which was erected the edifice of Western music. In all eras, whether chanted, sung, or declaimed in elaborate settings for choirs and instruments - never faraway lurked images of King David the psalmist, Temple service, sacred singers, pilgrims, and angels engaged in acts of Divine adoration. Psalms & Music examines the reciprocal influences of Psalms on music and music on Psalms in a broad range of styles and contexts, historic genres, and contemporary idioms ranging from worship to entertainment, liturgical devotions to public performances. These include: chants, motets, cantatas, art music of all dimensions, folk and popular songs, and even rock music. An extensive bibliographic appendix listing thousands of settings, psalm by psalm, is a key feature of the book.

Powers of Divergence,Lucia D'Errico,music,,/works/OL20930281W,/authors/OL8011671A/Lucia_D'Errico,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Leuven University Press|Language English|Pages 220,"""Beyond resemblance: creative divergence in music performance    What does it mean to produce resemblance in the performance of written music? Starting from how this question is commonly answered by the practice of interpretation in Western notated art music, this book proposes a move beyond commonly accepted codes, conventions and territories of music performance. Appropriating reflections from post-structural philosophy, visual arts and semiotics, and crucially based upon an artistic research project with a strong creative and practical component, it proposes a new approach to music performance. The approach is based on divergence, on the difference produced by intensifying the chasm between the symbolic aspect of music notation and the irreducible materiality of performance. Instead of regarding performance as reiteration, reconstruction and reproduction of past musical works, Powers of Divergence emphasises its potential for the emergence of the new and for the problematisation of the limits of musical semiotics.""

It covers the history, reception, and practice of psalm use and contains all 150 psalms, most in multiple formats. For each psalm, this volume includes: the complete New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) text of the psalm, presented with alternating regular and boldfaced type for responsive readings and red markings that enable the chanting of the psalm; a Christian prayer that responds to a theme, imagery, or basic intent of the psalm; a brief footnote which identifies the psalm's genre or type, highlights significant features of its form or imagery, and suggests a range of uses in Christian worship; one or more settings of the psalm, most of which are musical settings for congregational use. This range of material means that the book is well-suited to a variety of uses: corporate worship -- to be placed in the hands of worship leaders, choirs, and, ideally, all worshipers; daily prayer at morning, noon, evening, and/or night; personal and family devotion; a resource for Bible study; for preachers, as a commentary on the book of Psalms; to inspire composers in a wide range of cultures and traditions to imagine new, vital, and faithful ways of rendering psalms. Psalms for All Seasons is well suited for use in worship and practical theology courses. It is also an invaluable resource for churches of all traditions, assisting clergy, worship leaders and planners, and choirs in bringing the Psalms back into the heart of congregational worship. - Publisher.

A Generative theory of tonal music,,music,First published in 1996,/works/OL16927288W?edition=ia%3Agenerativetheory00jack,,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9616488M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 3, 1996|Publisher  The MIT Press|Language English|Pages 368","A classic in music theory since its publication in 1983, this work models music understanding from the perspective of cognitive science. The point of departure is a search for a grammar of music with the aid of generative linguistics. The theory, which is illustrated with numerous examples from Western classical music, relates the aural surface of a piece to the musical structure unconsciously inferred by the experienced listener. From the viewpoint of traditional music theory, it offers many innovations in notation as well as in the substance of rhythmic and reductional theory. - Back cover.

Oui, sous réserve d'accepter avec enthousiasme l'idée d'une éducation permanente.    Or, cette éducation permanente, souhaitée et maintenant nécessaire, exige un premier sacrifice, celui du temps a prendre sur les loisirs ou sur les occupations productives. Ce temps si précieux à accorder à la lecture, à la réflexion et à l'entraînement intellectuel, il faut disposer de méthodes didactiques pour l'économiser, et particulièrement dans le domaine du livre, d'une présentation à la fois condensée mais ouverte. Telles ont été les motivations essentielles des animateurs de la collection Science - Poche.    Le lecteur trouvera dans cette collection une présentation didactique très soignée, un souci permanent de rigueur scientifique associé à un désir intense de communication, une attitude a la fois prudente et enthousiaste des auteurs. Grâce à cet effort pédagogique, le lecteur pourra, comme il est souhaitable, mieux communiquer en dehors des disciplines et domaines où se situent ses activités.    Ce que Science-Poche veut offrir à ses lecteurs, n'est pas de la science au rabais ou de la science fiction, mais un exposé honnête et dynamique des possibilités des sciences et techniques.    Science-Poche, une collection didactique à l'âge de l'ordinateur, de l'espace et de l'atome.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Its pages reflect on the echoes of the troubadour compositions in the voice of Don Quixote, and seek the reconstruction of the historical and social assumptions that governed the Cervantes’ works, recovering his life experiences, in order to determine the extent of possible scope and origin of his technical knowledge of the musical phenomenon that he continually uses and describes in his works . The paremiological contexts and social archetypes, the role of the musician, the relevance of the emblematical literature in shaping the musical episodes, the textual relationships established by his works, introducing musical compositions set in music by contemporaneous composers; the description of the locus amoenus or other musical links provided not only by the catholic liturgy but by other poems borrowed from his admired poets such  Garcilaso, Herrera, Boscan  and Petrarch –poems that were sung in his time-,  provide us an historical and relevant facts to the study of musical phenomenon in Cervantes’ works.

Christian metal is a rare example of a direct combination between evangelical Christianity and an aggressive and highly controversial form of popular music and its culture. Christian Metal: History, Ideology, Scene is the first full exploration of the phenomenon of Christian metal music, its history, main characteristics, development, diversification, and key ideological traits from its formative years in the early 1980s to the present day. Marcus Moberg situates it in a wider international evangelical cultural environment, accounts for its diffusion on a transnational scale, and explores what religious meanings and functions Christian metal holds for its own musicians and followers. Engaging with wider debates on religion, media and popular culture, Christian Metal: History, Ideology and Scene is a much-needed resource in the study of religion and popular music""--Provided by publisher.

The year is 1777 and the four Weber sisters, daughters of a musical family, share a crowded, artistic life in a ramshackle house. While their father scrapes by as a music copyist and their mother secretly draws up a list of prospective suitors in the kitchen, the sisters struggle with their futures, both marital and musical—until twenty-one-year-old Wolfgang Mozart walks into their lives. Bringing eighteenth-century Europe to life with unforgiving winters, yawning princes, scheming parents, and the enduring passions of young talent, Stephanie Cowell's richly textured tale captures a remarkable historical figure—and the four young women who engage his passion, his music, and his heart.

In Groove Interrupted, Keith Spera’s intimately reported, contemporary narrative, musicians confront challenges that threaten their ability to make music. Aaron Neville returns to New Orleans for the first time after Hurricane Katrina to bury his wife. Fats Domino improbably rambles around Manhattan to promote a post-Katrina tribute CD. Alex Chilton lives anonymously in a battered cottage in the Treme neighborhood. Platinum-selling rapper Mystikal rekindles his career after six years in prison. Jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard struggles to translate Katrina to music. Allen Toussaint, Pete Fountain, Gatemouth Brown, the Rebirth Brass Band, hard rocker Phil Anselmo, Juvenile, trumpeter Jeremy Davenport and Jazz Fest producer Quint Davis are also featured. Each story stands on its own; together, with heartache, hope, humor and resolve, they convey a sense of what New Orleans music was and is, in spite of Katrina’s interruption.

Il traite l'harmonie tonale dans les musiques africaines. Celle-ci se caractérise par l'harmonie semi consonante simple (soit l'harmonie qui étudie les accords semi consonants de quinte, de sixte et de quarte et sixte) et l'harmonie semi consonante complexe (qui étudie les accords semi consonants de plus de trois sons). L'auteur précise le fonctionnement de ce système tonal en se servant des lois et principes, des notions de fonctions tonals, de modulations fonctionnelles et de modulations ordinaires, des cadences natoniques et des notions des marches harmoniques complexes. De plus, il présente des règles, des lois et des principes propres à son fonctionnement. Il décrit ainsi les mythes existant entre la musique africaine et la musique occidentale sans qu'il n'y ait de confusions entre les deux.""--Page 4 of cover.

It gathers testimonies from a variety of artists from different backgrounds into a single stream of (often contrary) opinions. Together, they address questions like: How do life circumstances find their way into music and sound art? How does music reflect historical and social structures? What does discrimination do, and how can we navigate around it? How to unlock networks? Is the under-representaiton of women and LGBTQ people in the field a symptom or a cause? Is art itself gendered? And can it reflect the gender of its maker? Is a different way of listening needed to more accurately understand those voices from outside the historical canon?""

Land of a thousand bridges,June Millington,music,First published in 2015,/works/OL20014090W,/authors/OL7604043A/June_Millington,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 536,"This autobiography by one of rock-and-roll’s most important foremothers, June Millington, tells the story that's never been told: how girls in the mid-60's started all-girl bands, learned to play electric, and became Fanny, one of the first all-female rock bands to be signed to a major label. Fanny soon began recording and touring worldwide with bands like Chicago and Dr. John. After Fanny, June became involved in the women’s music movement when she was asked to play on and tour behind Cris Williamson’s ""The changer and the changed,"" which would become the defining album of that genre. Women’s music quickly evolved into an independent feminist music network that included (often collectively run) production companies,venues, festivals, record labels, and distribution networks. Land of a thousand bridges chronicles the story of a young girl born to a mixed-race couple in the Phillipines, who traveled to the US with big dreams of becoming a rock star, and made those dreams come true.

Folk music has a varied and complex scope and lineage, including the blues, minstrel tunes, Victorian parlor songs, spirituals and gospel tunes, country and western songs, sea shanties, labor and political songs, calypsos, pop folk, folk-rock, ethnic, bluegrass, and more. The genre is of major importance in the broader spectrum of American music, and it is easy to understand why folk music has been marketed as America's music.Selling Folk Music presents the public face of folk music in the United States through its commercial promotion and presentation through much of the twentieth century. Included are concert flyers; sheet music; book, songbook, magazine, and album covers; concert posters and flyers; and movie lobby cards and posters, all in their original colors. The 1964 hootenanny craze, for example, spawned such items as a candy bar, pinball machine, bath powder, paper dolls, Halloween costumes, and beach towels. The almost five hundred images in Selling Folk Music present a new way to catalog the history of folk music while highlighting the transformative nature of the genre. Following the detailed introduction on the history of folk music, illustrations from commercial products make up the bulk of the work, presenting a colorful, complex history of folk music.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The product of extensive interviews with all three members and corroborating evidence from key insiders and press, this unprecedented examination features previously unpublished candid photographs by official band photographer Andrew MacNaughtan. Musings on playing live and the grind of touring are presented, revealing the trio’s evolution over the past three decades.

This book presents a cultural history of modern Southeast Asia from the vantage point of popular music, considering not just singers and musicians but their fans as well, showing how the music was intrinsically bound up with modern life and the societal changes that came with it. Reaching new audiences across national borders, popular music of the period helped push social change, and at times served as a medium for expressions of social or political discontent.

Metaphors of depth in German musical thought,Holly Watkins,music,First published in 2011,/works/OL15902319W,/authors/OL6933210A/Holly_Watkins,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""What does it mean to say that music is deeply moving? Or that music's aesthetic value derives from its deep structure? This study traces the widely employed trope of musical depth to its origins in German-language music criticism and analysis. From the Romantic aesthetics of E. T. A. Hoffmann to the modernist theories of Arnold Schoenberg, metaphors of depth attest to the cross-pollination of music with discourses ranging from theology, geology and poetics to psychology, philosophy and economics. The book demonstrates that the persistence of depth metaphors in musicology and music theory today is an outgrowth of their essential role in articulating and transmitting Germanic cultural values. While musical depth metaphors have historically served to communicate German nationalist sentiments, Watkins shows that an appreciation for the broad connotations of those metaphors opens up exciting new avenues for interpretation""--  ""This series explores the conceptual frameworks that shape or have shaped the ways in which we understand music and its history, and aims to elaborate structures of explanation, interpretation, commentary, and criticism which make music intelligible and which provide a basis for argument about judgements of value. The intellectual scope of the series is broad. Some investigations will treat, for example, historiographical topics, others will apply cross-disciplinary methods to the criticism of music, and there will also be studies which consider music in its relation to society, culture, and politics. Overall, the series hopes to create a greater presence for music in the ongoing discourse among the human sciences""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each character has a suggested instrument and they can decide how to play it when the character comes into the story - choosing duration, dynamics etc (if you want to stick to the NC music!). What a pity there wasn't a series 2 as far as I know. I bought a few of them when my local music shop closed down and I now use them in in-service support to teachers.    There are three stories in the book, and then they can progress to choosing their own instruments (timbre) for other stories and poems, or choosing different instruments for these stories to improve on their first try.     This book isn't in print any more, but maybe if enough people complain to the publishers, they may release it again. You may find some secondhand if you're very lucky.

L' eredità musicale di Giacomo Leopardi,Giuseppe Luppino,music,First published in 2002,/works/OL6068252W,/authors/OL1536230A/Giuseppe_Luppino,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3745776M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  Edizioni CNSL|Language Italian|Pages 213,"Quello che Giuseppe Luppino, bibliotecario dell’Università di Macerata e cultore di studi teorico-pratici di natura musicale, è riuscito a portare a compimento, grazie al sostegno del Centro Nazionale di Studi Leopardiani, è stato lavoro lungo e complesso, frutto di anni di ricerca e paziente compilazione. L’eredità musicale di Giacomo Leopardi rappresenta una fondamentale bibliografia analitica dedicata al rapporto tra il recanatese e la musica (“poco importa”, come sostiene Franco Foschi, “ se il Poeta avesse o no importanti conoscenze teoriche sulla musica, essendo ormai certo che suono, canto, armonia e musica, sono parte tutt’altro che marginale delle sue teorie poetiche del suo pensiero”) ed arricchisce in questo modo la documentazione raccolta da Paola Ciarlantini ed Ermanno Carini in Composizioni per Leopardi. La raccolta musicale del Centro nazionale di studi leopardiani, con saggio introduttivo di Franco Foschi, Edizioni del CNSL, Recanati 2000.    Impressionante per la quantità d’informazioni che fornisce, il volume, come riferisce lo stesso Luppino, “rappresenta una guida, un percorso tracciato all’interno della ben più ampia bibliografia critica sulla produzione poetica e letteraria leopardiana”, e prende in considerazione più filoni di studio: l’estetica musicale in Leopardi e le sue occasioni di ascolti musicali, i brani musicali composti su testi leopardiani, il problema della musicalità e della musicabilità dei versi leopardiani, la paragonabilità della biografia leopardiana con quella di alcuni musicisti (da Bellini a Beethoven, da Schubert a Chopin, a Verdi), le recensioni dai concerti, cronache, critiche, monografie.    È proprio quest’approccio a rendere il lavoro massimamente fondamentale per gli studiosi: la natura più propria della bibliografia analitica è quella di saper collegare libri ad altri libri.    Come sostiene Claudia Colombati nella Prefazione al volume “ecco allora un iter secondo analogie di contenuti, rimandi impliciti od espliciti, citazioni, ‘testi insospettati’, articolati nel testo come momenti o sezioni bibliografiche. “Un elemento particolare di ulteriore caratterizzazione è dato dalle citazioni estratte da articoli e monografie e dalla valutazione che Luppino esprime circa il “grado di esattezza ed attendibilità.    “Volentieri rivolgiamo infine a Luppino la provocazione con la quale la Colombati conclude la citata Prefazione, cioè che lo studio bibliografico compiuto sino a questo punto possa essere condotto “oltre il confine della riflessione italiana, nei Paesi europei.”     E perché, aggiungiamo noi, non oltre gli stessi confini europei?  recensione    di Vito Punzi in: http://giornale.regione.marche.it/archivio/num0303/artcom26.htm   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As an educator with extensive experience in professional theatre production, author John Kenrick approaches the subject with a unique appreciation of musicals as both an art form and a business. Using anecdotes, biographical profiles, clear definitions, sample scenes and select illustrations, Kenrick focuses on landmark musicals, and on the extraordinary talents and business innovators who have helped musical theatre evolve from its roots in the dramas of ancient Athens all the way to the latest hits on Broadway and London's West End. Key improvements to the second edition: a new foreword by Oscar Hammerstein III, a critically acclaimed historian and member of a family with deep ties to the musical theatre, is included; the 28 chapters are reformatted for the typical 14 week, 28 session academic course, as well as for a two semester, once-weekly format, making it easy for educators to plan a syllabus and reading assignments; to make the book more interactive, each chapter includes suggested listening and reading lists, designed to help readers step beyond the printed page to experience great musicals and performers for themselves.

The first is Judah Moscato, who, as chief rabbi in Mantua, preached sermons, one of them on music: there Moscato presents music as a cosmic and spiritual phenomenon. The second scholar is Leon Modena, the foremost Jewish intellectual in early seventeenth-century Venice. Modena deals with music in two responsa to questions put to him for rabbinical adjudication, one of them an examination of biblical and rabbinical sources on the legitimacy of performing art music in the synagogue. Abraham Portaleone, the third scholar, treated music in a massive disquisition on the ancient temple and its ritual, describing it as an art correlating with contemporary Italian music. The introduction surveys the development of Hebrew art music from the Bible through the Talmud and rabbinical writings until the early modern era. The epilogue defines the special contribution of Hebrew scholars to early modern theory""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A catalogue of recorded classical and traditional Indian music,Alain Daniélou,music,First published in 1952,/works/OL1300225W,/authors/OL132047A/Alain_Daniélou,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1952|Publisher  UNESCO|Pages 235,"This bilingual (English & French) book comprises a listing of gramophone records of classical and traditional Indian music painstakingly compiled with available details. It also includes a very useful primer on Indian music and Indian musical instruments. Some archival photographs have been added. In the words of the compiler: ""The preparation of a catalogue of recorded music in India is, in a way, a distressing    task, for the best of the music recorded has been destroyed without any regard for    its artistic value.        Some of the most important recording companies were and still are mainly    foreign concerns and have no responsible artistic adviser.        If the sales of a record fail to reach a certain figure during a three-monthly    period, the record is automatically destroyed. The great majority of the records    which should figure in this catalogue are therefore no longer available and almost    all the records of musicians of the past generation have been destroyed.        Yet in order to give a reasonable idea of recorded Indian classical music, we have    maintained a certain number of important records of which the matrices were    recently destroyed but which are to be found in the collections of every music lover    in India.

Quelques années plus tard il devint indispensable de disposer d'un synthé. Point ! On ne compte plus les ouvrages dédiés à ces instruments fondamentaux. En revanche, on a moins fréquemment célébré le piano (pourtant, Jerry Lee Lewis et Elton John ont des millions de fans), et quasiment jamais la flûte ou le violon. Quant à la mandoline, n'en parlons pas ! Et bien si, justement, parlons-en: le présent ouvrage est consacré à tous ces instruments - et ils sont nombreux - souvent discrets et, de ce fait, rarement cités, sans qui rock et pop music n'auraient peut-être pas acquis aussi indiscutablement leurs lettres de noblesse: que serait ' Yesterday ' sans son quatuor à cordes, ou ' Blowin' In The Wind ' sans l'émouvant harmonica de Bob Dylan ? Nos auteurs se sont penchés sur un tonneau sans fond et en ont extirpé, qui un banjo, un sitar ou une cithare. qui un saxophone, un dulcimer ou un clavecin, voire une harpe (et la liste est loin d'être finie, comme vous vous en rendrez compte à la lecture de ce passionnant opus)""--4th page of cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After considering how people now engage with music in the digital world and reviewing current advances in developmental and music psychology, Hargreaves and Lamont compare ten major theoretical approaches in this field -- including cognitive stage models and neuroscientific, ecological, and social cognitive approaches -- and assess how successfully each of these deals with five critical theoretical issues. Individual chapters deal next with cognition, perception, and learning; social development; environmental influences on ability, achievement and motivation; identity, personality, and lifestyle; affect and emotion; and well-being and health. With an emphasis on practical applications throughout, this book will be essential reading for students and scholars of music psychology, developmental psychology, music education, and music therapy.""--Back cover.

The 10 Appendices and 31 Tables facilitate access to the location of thousands of documents pertaining to Ospedali and Venetian studies: more than 2300 music manuscripts; bio-bibliographies of 312 male maestri; 845 figlie del coro and female maestri; indexes of artists, inventories of art, architecture, and iconography including musical instruments connected with the Ospedali; and descriptions of the social, historical, and governmental structures of Venice associated with the Ospedali. The correlation of the material in the two volumes provides the specific resources for the corresponding chapters of Jane Berdes' Women Musicians of Venice: Musical Foundations, 1525-1855. A Guide to Ospedali Research also serves as a catalogue to the more than 46, 000 items in the archive of Jane Berdes housed at Duke University and to the location of manuscripts throughout American and European archives and libraries.

Memphis rent party,"Gordon, Robert",music,First published in 2018,/works/OL19734968W,/authors/OL579110A/Gordon_Robert,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 254,"The fabled city of Memphis has been essential to American music--home of the blues, the birthplace of rock and roll, a soul music capital. We know the greatest hits, but celebrated author Robert Gordon takes us to the people and places history has yet to record. A Memphis native, he whiles away time in a crumbling duplex with blues legend Furry Lewis, stays up late with barrelhouse piano player Mose Vinson, and sips homemade whiskey at Junior Kimbrough's churning house parties. A passionate listener, he hears modern times deep in the grooves of old records by Lead Belly and Robert Johnson. The interconnected profiles and stories in Memphis Rent Party convey more than a region. Like mint seeping into bourbon, Gordon gets into the wider world. He beholds the beauty of mistakes with producer Jim Dickinson (Replacements, Rolling Stones), charts the stars with Alex Chilton (Box Tops, Big Star), and mulls the tragedy of Jeff Buckley's fatal swim. Gordon's Memphis inspires Cat Power, attracts Townes Van Zandt, and finds James Carr always singing at the dark end of the street. A rent party is when friends come together to hear music, dance, and help a pal through hard times; it's a celebration in the face of looming tragedy, an optimism when the wolf is at the door. Robert Gordon finds mystery in the mundane, inspiration in the bleakness, and revels in the individualism that connects these diverse encounters.

Making music meaningful,David Hayes,music,First published in 2006,/works/OL13484090W,/authors/OL6359081A/David_Hayes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Language English|Pages 294,"I argue that technology plays an important role in how these youth consume popular music, and in how they produce themselves as 'dedicated' fans of particular artists and music subgenera, and subsequently position themselves as more 'involved' in music consumption than many of their peers. I suggest that these young people's investments in music assist them in understanding diverse music texts as well as wider societal issues, albeit in contradictory ways. Furthermore, I show how some young men of the study who are invested in rap culture (re)articulate its core signifiers of Black urban identity as a means to counteract (what they perceive as) boredom and its interrelation with their town as a site of whiteness. Finally, I argue that the participants' gendering of pop music as a site of femininity and rock as a site of masculinity shapes how they select music and present themselves as fans, as well as how they understand and respond to other young men and women in their community.This thesis examines how young people in a non-urban Ontario town consume and invest themselves in contemporary popular music. I focus on how youth use technology (contemporary and seemingly retrogressive technologies) to access and listen to music, and how their investments in individual music preferences shape their perceptions and negotiations of racialized and gendered identities.While much work on youth and music has focused on urban subcultures, my study examines a group of youth residing in a small town characterized by its overwhelming whiteness. Using qualitative inquiry, I interviewed 23 young men and women individually and in focus groups. Their narratives suggest that their consumption of popular music and its role in the formation of individual and social identities is every bit as complex as their much-studied urban peers (including those participating in widely recognized youth subcultures).This thesis adds to the small number of qualitative studies of youth who, although they classify themselves as active, passionate music fans, are not affiliated with recognizable subcultures. As well, the study contributes to knowledge about youth in small towns and rural Canadian communities.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Taylor is known for his insightful essays on music, globalization, and capitalism. This is a collection of some of Taylor's most recent writings essays concerned with questions about music in capitalist cultures, covering a historical span that begins in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and continues to the present. These essays look at shifts in the production, dissemination, advertising, and consumption of music from the industrial capitalism of the nineteenth century to the globalized neoliberal capitalism of the past few decades. In addition to chapters on music, capitalism, and globalization, 'Music and the World' includes previously unpublished essays on the continuing utility of the culture of concept in the study of music, a historicization of treatments of affect, and an essay on value and music. Taken together, Taylor's essays chart the changes in different kinds of music in twentieth- and twenty-first-century music and culture from a variety of theoretical perspectives.

Wynne tells the story of the parallel careers of these two pioneering recording artists--one black, one white--who moved beyond their humble origins to change the face of American music. As the invention of the phonograph disseminated traditional forms of music to a wider audience, Jimmie Rodgers gained fame as the 'Father of Country Music,' and Patton's work earned him the title 'King of the Delta Blues.'

A run-down bungalow sandwiched between a funeral home and a beauty shop in a poor Detroit neighborhood served as his headquarters. The building's entrance was adorned with a large sign that improbably boasted ""Hitsville U.S.A."" The kitchen served as the control room, the garage became the two-track studio, the living room was reserved for bookkeeping, and sales were handled in the dining room. Soon word spread that any youngster with a streak of talent should visit the only record label that Detroit had seen in years. The company's name was Motown.Motown cuts through decades of unsubstantiated rumors and speculation to tell the true behind-the-scenes narrative of America's most exciting musical dynasty. It follows the company and its amazing roster of stars from the tumultuous growth years in Detroit, to the drama and intrigue of Hollywood in the 1970s, to resurgence in 2002.Set against the civil rights movement, the decay of America's northern industrial cities, and the social upheaval of the 1960s, Motown is a tale of the incredible entrepreneurship of Berry Gordy. But it also features the moving stories of kids from Detroit's inner-city projects who achieved remarkable success and then, in many cases, found themselves fighting the demons that so often come with stardom--drugs, jealousy, sexual indulgence, greed, and uncontrollable ambition. Motown features an extraordinary cast of characters, including Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Stevie Wonder. They are presented as they lived and worked: a clan of friends, lovers, competitors, and sometimes vicious foes. Motown reveals how the hopes and dreams of each affected the lives of the others and illustrates why this singular story is a made-in-America Greek tragedy, the rise and fall of a supremely talented yet completely dysfunctional extended family. Based on numerous original interviews and extensive documentation, Motown benefits particularly from the thousands of pages of files crammed into the basement of downtown Detroit's Wayne County Courthouse. Those court records provide the unofficial--and hitherto largely untold--history of Motown and its stars, since almost every relationship between departing singers, songwriters, producers, and the label ended up in litigation. From its peaks in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Motown controlled the pop charts and its stars were sought after even by the Beatles, through the inexorable slide caused by their failure to handle their stardom, Motown is a riveting and troubling look inside a music label that provided the unofficial soundtrack to an entire generation.From the Hardcover edition.

This has happened to us so many times that we decided to compile a book of our favorite songs and fingerplays to share with our forgetful friends and their wee ones.  Music can create a special closeness and joy to those who experience it together. However, for a child, there is more to music than mere enjoyment. Language development, muscular coordination, body awareness, rhythmic proficiency, auditory discrimination and self confidence are a few of the benefits acquired from an early exposure to music. The young child is eager for musical and rhythmic experiences, thus providing a perfect time to introduce songs and fingerplays.  Music can also provide a positive resource for approaching those crisis situations with children. As the hour of waiting in the doctor's office is drawing to a critical climax, nimble those fingers, begin ""Three little Monkeys"" and feel the knot in your stomach untie. Or, as the road sign reads 20 more miles, bellow out ""a chick, chick here"" and watch the scowl on Dad's face disappear as he joins in with ""a chick, chick there."" Music may be the answer in moving from crisis to calm.  We want to thank our many friends who have contributed to this book. For them, and for you, we hope Wee Sing will bring many special, enjoyable times with your wee ones.    Pam Beali & Susan Nipp   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Spanning several decades of his life as a composer, the sonatas soon came to be seen as the first body of substantial serious works for piano suited to performance in large concert halls seating hundreds of people."" ""In this practical guide for both listener and performer, Charles Rosen places the sonatas in context and provides an understanding of the formal principles involved in interpreting and performing this unique repertoire, covering such aspects as sonata form, phrasing, and tempo, as well as the use of pedal and trills. In the second part of his book, he looks at the sonatas individually, from the earliest works of the 1790s through the sonatas of Beethoven's youthful popularity of the early 1800s, the subsequent years of mastery, the years of stress (1812-1817), and the last three sonatas of the 1820s.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

All the tools for understanding and executing first-class collaborative piano are here, paired with audio recordings of many of the musical examples performed by the author himself, along with two vocalists, on a companion website. The obvious topics -- breathing, languages, flexibility, and creating a collaborative atmosphere -- discussed at length and articulated clearly for the curious novice, will prove beneficial for even the experienced professional. In addition, two significant chapters deal with orchestral accompaniment, reflecting today's requirements for any professional accompanist. Oft-neglected details such as beginning a piece together, telling stories with piano solos, tuning, and balance between the players are also covered. Dubbed the ""Dean of Accompanists"" by the Los Angeles Times, Martin Katz, a teacher of sold-out master classes, presents his material clearly and incisively but always with the humor and wit for which he is known. Whether the reader is a curious novice, an amateur who wants to accompany as best he can, or an experienced professional seeking confirmation or a new look at the role of any partner, The Complete Collaborator is all one needs. - Jacket flap.
