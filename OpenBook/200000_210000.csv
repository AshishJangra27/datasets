As private bidders and representatives from Christie's and Sotheby's go at each other, and local-theater diva Vivian barks her way into auctioneering infamy, Brandy tries her best to stay calm—all this craziness can't be good for her pregnancy (did we mention she's surrogate mom for her best gal pal?).It's not so good for the winning bidder, either, who turns up mortally scrambled at the foot of a church-tower staircase...without the prized egg. Soon no one is safe, everyone's a suspect, and even the thought of food is sending the now Prozac-free mom-to-be sprinting for the nearest porcelain altar. It's going to take a little fuzzy therapy from Sushi—Brandy's peppy Shih Tzu—and a lot of Mother's charmingly, alarmingly meddlesome inquiries to track down this killer...who is one seriously bad egg!Don't miss Brandy Borne's tips on antiques!

What better shooting set than a creepy old house, the site of a 60-year-old unsolved axe murder?  The location is perfect until Bruce Spring, the show's producer, meets a fatal axe-ident, mortally mauled just like the home's previous owner. The first suspect on the chopping block seems typecast for the role of killer -- he was found at the scene of the attack, clutching a stained axe. But as Brandy and Vivian chop around for clues, plenty of other suspects stick out their necks…  It seems the show's cameraman clashed with Bruce -- could he be the culprit? What about the acrimony between Andrew, the harried homeowner, and Bruce, whose dirt-digging documentary all but accused Andrew of the original unsolved crime? And who's driving that blood-red Toyota that keeps making unscripted cameo appearances? If Brandy and Vivian are going to get to the bottom of this mystery, they'll have to be extra careful not to wind up on the cutting room floor -- in pieces!

It explains how dogs train their owners, and debunks the many myths about our four-legged friends--such as the belief that they see in black and white--while investigating the mysteries of canine psychology--what does that guilty face really mean and how come dogs seem to know when we're coming home? This wonderful collection of canine curiosities also explores the place of dogs in the human imagination, from cartoons and literary characters to ghosts and dog-headed saints. The clever dogs, the cute dogs, the bizarre dogs and the devoted, hard-working dogs are all put under scrutiny, giving us even more reason to utterly adore our canine companions.

Geneva’s Ban on Dangerous Dog Breeds: Taking Dog breeds to Switzerland,Travelling Pet,dogs,First published in 2011,/works/OL15709219W,/authors/OL6892210A/Travelling_Pet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Travelling Pet,"BE AWARE: Travel, Residence, and Missions to Geneva with Dogs can be Complicated by Dangerous Breed Bans  If you are wondering about taking dog breeds to Switzerland, read on...  As of September 15, 2008, Geneva’s list of dogs declared as dangerous or vicious has grown to 15. The latest additions are the Bullmastiff, Thai Ridgeback, and French Mastiff (a.k.a. Bordeaux Bulldog).  These additions are only the latest in Geneva’s history of dog-banning. The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.  Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.    Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.  Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements. A complete list of dangerous breeds and regulations can be obtained through Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office.  Lap Dogs aren’t Off the Hook, Either  In addition to provisions that must be made for dangerous breeds, Geneva’s general dog owner population (caretakers of the canton’s 30,000 dogs) is subject to new rules, also. As previously declared, specific guidelines for the proper keeping of dogs must be followed. But more recently, every dog owner is now required to attend a dog ownership course, regardless of their dog’s breed.  Furthermore, dog walkers must now be licensed.  Questions about Geneva’s Dog Regulations?  Geneva isn’t the only Swiss canton that’s tightening the leash when it comes to dog control. Valais, Fribourg, Bern, and Zurich have their own legislation. And, prospects point toward future rulings regarding care and control of dogs in all of Switzerland, including tougher liability for owners and nationwide breed bans.  If you’re confused about where you and your dog fall within these regulations, contact Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office or you can Contact Us.    p.s. Don’t fail to comply with Geneva’s newest, and oldest, dog ownership regulations due to misinformation or no information. These laws are in place to protect both you and your animal. Dr. Omaboe’s veterinary staff at Cabinet Vétérinaire International can answer your questions regarding general dog ownership or the handling of a dangerous breed situation.  p.p.s. Whether you’re a lifelong Geneva native, visitor, or expatriate, familiarizing yourself with the rules governing dog ownership within the canton will prevent complications.

Geneva’s Ban on Dangerous Dog Breeds: Taking Dog breeds to Switzerland,Travelling Pet,dogs,First published in 2011,/works/OL15711887W,/authors/OL6892210A/Travelling_Pet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Travelling Pet,"BE AWARE: Travel, Residence, and Missions to Geneva with Dogs can be Complicated by Dangerous Breed Bans  If you are wondering about taking dog breeds to Switzerland, read on...  As of September 15, 2008, Geneva’s list of dogs declared as dangerous or vicious has grown to 15. The latest additions are the Bullmastiff, Thai Ridgeback, and French Mastiff (a.k.a. Bordeaux Bulldog).  These additions are only the latest in Geneva’s history of dog-banning. The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.  Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.  Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.  Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements. A complete list of dangerous breeds and regulations can be obtained through Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office.    Lap Dogs aren’t Off the Hook, Either  In addition to provisions that must be made for dangerous breeds, Geneva’s general dog owner population (caretakers of the canton’s 30,000 dogs) is subject to new rules, also. As previously declared, specific guidelines for the proper keeping of dogs must be followed. But more recently, every dog owner is now required to attend a dog ownership course, regardless of their dog’s breed.  Furthermore, dog walkers must now be licensed.  Questions about Geneva’s Dog Regulations?  Geneva isn’t the only Swiss canton that’s tightening the leash when it comes to dog control. Valais, Fribourg, Bern, and Zurich have their own legislation. And, prospects point toward future rulings regarding care and control of dogs in all of Switzerland, including tougher liability for owners and nationwide breed bans.  If you’re confused about where you and your dog fall within these regulations, contact Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office or you can Contact Us.    p.s. Don’t fail to comply with Geneva’s newest, and oldest, dog ownership regulations due to misinformation or no information. These laws are in place to protect both you and your animal. Dr. Omaboe’s veterinary staff at Cabinet Vétérinaire International can answer your questions regarding general dog ownership or the handling of a dangerous breed situation.  p.p.s. Whether you’re a lifelong Geneva native, visitor, or expatriate, familiarizing yourself with the rules governing dog ownership within the canton will prevent complications. And following those rules will protect you, your dog, and your record with the law.

Geneva’s Ban on Dangerous Dog Breeds: Taking Dog breeds to Switzerland,Travelling Pet,dogs,First published in 2011,/works/OL15707414W,/authors/OL6892210A/Travelling_Pet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Travelling Pet,"BE AWARE: Travel, Residence, and Missions to Geneva with Dogs can be Complicated by Dangerous Breed Bans  If you are wondering about taking dog breeds to Switzerland, read on...  As of September 15, 2008, Geneva’s list of dogs declared as dangerous or vicious has grown to 15. The latest additions are the Bullmastiff, Thai Ridgeback, and French Mastiff (a.k.a. Bordeaux Bulldog).  These additions are only the latest in Geneva’s history of dog-banning. The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.     Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.  Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.  Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements. A complete list of dangerous breeds and regulations can be obtained through Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office.  Lap Dogs aren’t Off the Hook, Either  In addition to provisions that must be made for dangerous breeds, Geneva’s general dog owner population (caretakers of the canton’s 30,000 dogs) is subject to new rules, also. As previously declared, specific guidelines for the proper keeping of dogs must be followed. But more recently, every dog owner is now required to attend a dog ownership course, regardless of their dog’s breed.  Furthermore, dog walkers must now be licensed.      Questions about Geneva’s Dog Regulations?  Geneva isn’t the only Swiss canton that’s tightening the leash when it comes to dog control. Valais, Fribourg, Bern, and Zurich have their own legislation. And, prospects point toward future rulings regarding care and control of dogs in all of Switzerland, including tougher liability for owners and nationwide breed bans.  If you’re confused about where you and your dog fall within these regulations, contact Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office or you can Contact Us.  p.s. Don’t fail to comply with Geneva’s newest, and oldest, dog ownership regulations due to misinformation or no information. These laws are in place to protect both you and your animal. Dr. Omaboe’s veterinary staff at Cabinet Vétérinaire International can answer your questions regarding general dog ownership or the handling of a dangerous breed situation.  p.p.s. Whether you’re a lifelong Geneva native, visitor, or expatriate, familiarizing yourself with the rules governing dog ownership within the canton will prevent complications.

Geneva’s Ban on Dangerous Dog Breeds: Taking Dog breeds to Switzerland,Travelling Pet,dogs,First published in 2011,/works/OL15706875W,/authors/OL6892210A/Travelling_Pet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Travelling Pet,"BE AWARE: Travel, Residence, and Missions to Geneva with Dogs can be Complicated by Dangerous Breed Bans  Taking Dog Breeds to Switzerland  If you are wondering about taking dog breeds to Switzerland, read on...  As of September 15, 2008, Geneva’s list of dogs declared as dangerous or vicious has grown to 15. The latest additions are the Bullmastiff, Thai Ridgeback, and French Mastiff (a.k.a. Bordeaux Bulldog).  These additions are only the latest in Geneva’s history of dog-banning. The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.  Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.  Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.  Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements.

Geneva’s Ban on Dangerous Dog Breeds: Taking Dog breeds to Switzerland,Travelling Pet,dogs,First published in 2011,/works/OL15720942W,/authors/OL6892210A/Travelling_Pet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Travelling Pet,"BE AWARE: Travel, Residence, and Missions to Geneva with Dogs can be Complicated by Dangerous Breed Bans  If you are wondering about taking dog breeds to Switzerland, read on...  As of September 15, 2008, Geneva’s list of dogs declared as dangerous or vicious has grown to 15. The latest additions are the Bullmastiff, Thai Ridgeback, and French Mastiff (a.k.a. Bordeaux Bulldog).  These additions are only the latest in Geneva’s history of dog-banning. The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.  Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.  Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.    Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements. A complete list of dangerous breeds and regulations can be obtained through Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office.  Lap Dogs aren’t Off the Hook, Either  In addition to provisions that must be made for dangerous breeds, Geneva’s general dog owner population (caretakers of the canton’s 30,000 dogs) is subject to new rules, also. As previously declared, specific guidelines for the proper keeping of dogs must be followed. But more recently, every dog owner is now required to attend a dog ownership course, regardless of their dog’s breed.  Furthermore, dog walkers must now be licensed.  Questions about Geneva’s Dog Regulations?  Geneva isn’t the only Swiss canton that’s tightening the leash when it comes to dog control. Valais, Fribourg, Bern, and Zurich have their own legislation. And, prospects point toward future rulings regarding care and control of dogs in all of Switzerland, including tougher liability for owners and nationwide breed bans.  If you’re confused about where you and your dog fall within these regulations, contact Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office or you can Contact Us.  p.s. Don’t fail to comply with Geneva’s newest, and oldest, dog ownership regulations due to misinformation or no information. These laws are in place to protect both you and your animal. Dr. Omaboe’s veterinary staff at Cabinet Vétérinaire International can answer your questions regarding general dog ownership or the handling of a dangerous breed situation.    p.p.s. Whether you’re a lifelong Geneva native, visitor, or expatriate, familiarizing yourself with the rules governing dog ownership within the canton will prevent complications.

The latest wave began in June of 2005, when a child was killed by a Pitbull Terrier, followed soon after by the mauling of another child by the same breed. The population’s outrage was felt in the first-ever Geneva citizen vote, which resulted in a landslide 80% in favor of stricter laws regarding breed control and owner education and regulation.  Dangerous Breeds Targeted  Per Geneva’s new dog ownership regulations, any of the 15 breeds considered to be dangerous must be muzzled and leashed when outside of their own homes. They must be spayed or neutered. Additionally, dogs that are mixed breeds, containing blood of any of the potentially vicious breeds, are subject to the same bans as purebreds.    Owners who owned one of the flagged breeds before legislation was passed may maintain the dog, but only after reporting ownership to the cantonal veterinary office, proving that the dog originated from an approved breeder, completing a dog training course, and licensing the dog. Only one dangerous breed is permitted per household.  Geneva divides the 15 breeds into different categories, with each category holding specific requirements. A complete list of dangerous breeds and regulations can be obtained through Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office.  Lap Dogs aren’t Off the Hook, Either  In addition to provisions that must be made for dangerous breeds, Geneva’s general dog owner population (caretakers of the canton’s 30,000 dogs) is subject to new rules, also. As previously declared, specific guidelines for the proper keeping of dogs must be followed. But more recently, every dog owner is now required to attend a dog ownership course, regardless of their dog’s breed.  Furthermore, dog walkers must now be licensed.  Questions about Geneva’s Dog Regulations?  Geneva isn’t the only Swiss canton that’s tightening the leash when it comes to dog control. Valais, Fribourg, Bern, and Zurich have their own legislation. And, prospects point toward future rulings regarding care and control of dogs in all of Switzerland, including tougher liability for owners and nationwide breed bans.  If you’re confused about where you and your dog fall within these regulations, contact Geneva’s cantonal veterinary office or you can Contact Us.    p.s. Don’t fail to comply with Geneva’s newest, and oldest, dog ownership regulations due to misinformation or no information. These laws are in place to protect both you and your animal. Dr. Omaboe’s veterinary staff at Cabinet Vétérinaire International can answer your questions regarding general dog ownership or the handling of a dangerous breed situation.  p.p.s. Whether you’re a lifelong Geneva native, visitor, or expatriate, familiarizing yourself with the rules governing dog ownership within the canton will prevent complications.

Then the ultimate insult: track down an escaped lab animal, a seventy-five-pound black Labrador retriever. But the dog turns out to be an extraordinary creature at the heart of an international collision between science, money, lust, and life itself. And as Elliot struggles to understand what's going on, the dog must wage its own desperate battle for survival .Elliot encounters a trophy wife from his own past, a professional killer with a medieval bent, a comatose surgeon with a checkered history, and a billionaire locked in a frantic struggle to stay alive--all connected to a dog that guards a secret far deadlier than anyone can imagine.From the Paperback edition.

Just think about different behaviors you see at a dog park: We have a good understanding of what it means when dogs wag their tails--but what about when they sniff and roll on a stinky spot? Why do they play tug-of-war with one dog, while showing their bellies to another? Why are some dogs shy, while others are bold? What goes on in dogs' heads and hearts--and how much can we know and understand?     Canine Confidential has the answers. Written by award-winning scientist--and lifelong dog lover--Marc Bekoff, it not only brilliantly opens up the world of dog behavior, but also helps us understand how we can make our dogs' lives the best they can possibly be.  Rooted in the most up-to-date science on cognition and emotion--fields that have exploded in recent years--Canine Confidential is a wonderfully accessible treasure trove of new information and myth-busting. Peeing, we learn, isn't always marking; grass-eating isn't always an attempt to trigger vomiting; it's okay to hug a dog--on their terms; and so much more. There's still much we don't know, but at the core of the book is the certainty that dogs do have deep emotional lives, and that as their companions we must try to make those lives as rich and fulfilling as possible. It's also clear that we must look at dogs as unique individuals and refrain from talking about ""the dog."" --amazon.com   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How people regard older animals is especially revealing. Beautiful Old Dogs honors our senior best friends and explores their current state of care and custody. This book is inspired by the exquisite photography of Garry Gross, a noted fashion photographer during the 60s, 70s and 80s who, after becoming a highly successful dog trainer in New York City, turned his camera lens towards dogs. Gross, along with Victoria Stilwell from Animal Planet's It's Me or the Dog, founded Dog Trainers of New York in 2002, and became devoted to highlighting the plight and value of senior dogs. ""The older the better,"" Gross said. ""Dogs with soul in their eyes."" The book also includes a practical resource guide for those wishing to learn more about caring for senior dogs. David Tabatsky, the co-author of Chicken Soup for the Soul's The Cancer Book: 101 Stories of Courage, Support and Love, has curated a selection of moving, insightful, and uplifting essays by a range of writers, with contributions from Anna Quindlen, Ally Sheedy, Dean Koontz, Marlo Thomas, and many more.

At first, it was definitely a case of the blind leading the blind, but, with his indomitable spirit and never-ending enthusiasm, Scout was soon leading the way.

Author Andrew De Prisco and illustrator Jason O’Malley have created a LGBTQ classic that defines the 28 “breeds” of gay men and recommends which breeds are best for each. From Drag Queen and All-American Boy to Twink, Leatherman, and Log Cabin Queer, every gay man will find advice and hilarity on every page of this award-winning gift book. (For gay men who are not sure of their breed, there is a temperament sorter to help determine their homo  DNA.)  In addition to being a breed-selection guide for the dog-loving Q-set, Woof! provides no-nonsense information about how to purchase a dog from a breeder, bringing the puppy home, training, caring, and feeding for the dog. It also offers tongue-in-cheek pointers along the lines of choosing the best gay name for the puppy, shopping for extravagant accessories, throwing a gay puppy shower (for the gifts!), hiring the right staff to take care of the puppy, and using the well-cared-for dog as a man magnet. DePrisco, who has been actively involved in the dog world (and gay world) for over two decades, has tapped all his doggy resources to bring readers the most fabulous advice from some of the nation’s Top Dog Men, including breeders of Westminster Best in Show winners, world-revered judges, and international canine experts. The chapter “Studs and Bitches: The Secret Sex Lives of Dogs” addresses hot topics such as homosexual dogs, promiscuity in the dog world, and getting unleashed and hooking up  at dog parks.  In the book’s final chapter ,“The Rainbow Tour: Stepping Out in Gay Society,” the author throws  a virtual pride parade of doggy activities, from the über-queer world of dog shows to vacations, gay resorts, and camping (with actual tents!). The true message of the book—beyond the campy humor, wildly funny illustrations, and off-color remarks—rings out from every page: Woof! is for everyone who wants to be the most responsible and devoted dog owners on the planet.

Much to Fabio’s horror, the dog they bring home is not the frisky brother he envisioned. It is fat old Gracie, fresh from the pound. She’s tired, she’s shy, and worst of all, she’s a girl.

It is estimated that by 2018 the cost of treating weight-related illnesses will double to almost $350 billion a year, while a 2010 report by the US Surgeon General estimates that two-thirds of American adults and almost one in three children are now overweight or obese. This volume originated in a special 2009 symposium funded in part by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and sponsorship from Mars WalthamA on how human-animal interaction may help fight obesity across the lifespan. The authors present scientific evidence about the benefits of dog walking for improving human and animal health, and case studies of programs that are using this powerful expression of the human-animal bond to combat obesity.

She focuses here on dog rescue, and its healing power not only for the dogs who are cared for and able to find good homes, but also for the people who bond with these animals. Klam became involved with rescue as a way to help and participate in a community, but she never imagined just how much she would receive in return. The dogs she has rescued through the years have filled her life with laughter and contentment, sorrow and frustration, and they have made certain that she never has a dull moment. Along the way, she has collected stories from friends who have also found that guiding dogs to nurturing homes made their own lives richer. These experiences show us that even in our smallest gestures we can make a big difference.--From publisher description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And as the big Christmas season gets into full swing, they find themselves in the midst of small-town mayhem when an old flame of Vivian's turns up mysteriously deceased. 'Tis the season--to be murdered?Brandy and her diva mom last saw the recently departed dealer, Walter Yeager, at a flea market where Vivian made her usual theatrical scene while saving Walter from under-pricing a valuable first edition of Tarzan and the Apes.

But another “hit” enters the picture, after a rival bidder becomes a one-woman show at their televised auctions -- and it's the estranged wife of Brandy's police-chief beau, Tony! Soon the fine art of murder colors the scene, fitting Brandy for an ornately elaborate frame.  But when you're inside a frame, it's difficult to make out the picture. That's why Brandy's mom -- her daughter now wearing basic jailhouse orange -- must sort through a rogue's gallery of suspects including a too-friendly farmer's wife, a ratings-happy TV producer, a questionable husband-and-wife auctioneer team, and even the chief of police himself.  Brandy and Vivian race to determine how an empty antique frame can hold a deadly portrait, a picture worth a thousand dangerous words. Aided only by Sushi, their loyal shih tzu, and police dog Rocky, the wacky mother-and-daughter sleuthing team must learn the killer's identity before they become the subjects of another masterpiece of murder.

All kinds of dogs make their way to the foundation, and it isn't that surprising to find a dog abandoned at the shelter one morning, though it was accompanied by a mysterious anonymous note. But they are quite surprised when they scan the dog's embedded chip, and discover that they know this dog. He is the ""DNA dog."" Two and a half years ago, Jill Hickman was a single mother of an adopted baby. Her baby and dog were kidnapped in broad daylight in Eastside Park, and they haven't been seen since. A tip came in that ID'd a former boyfriend of Hickman's, Keith Wachtel, as the kidnapper. A search of his house showed no sign of the child but did uncover more incriminating evidence, and the clincher that generated Wachtel's arrest was some dog hair, notable since Wachtel did not have a dog. DNA tests showed conclusively that the hair belonged to Hickman's dog. Wachtel was convicted of kidnapping, but the dog and baby were never found. Now, with the reappearance of the dog, the case is brought back to light, and the search for the child renewed. Goaded by his wife's desire to help a friend and fellow mother and Andy's desire to make sure the real kidnapper is in jail, Andy and his team enter the case.

Without really thinking about it, he continued to keep his arms around her too. She lay her head on his shoulder. He held her like this for what seemed forever and then kissed her softly. She smiled back at him, then asked playfully, Hi, who are you? Oh just some guy with a crush on you, he answered in a whisper. Evron, along with eleven of his dog friends, have come to Earth from another planet far away in space. They are here to see how Earth's kids respond to them. On Evron's planet, the animals and the kids talk to each other. The dogs are confidantes to the young people and so the kids talk to them about their private feelings. When they cannot relate to their parents or friends, they can always talk to their Evron friend in privacy. Evron is mature and compassionate, with the wisdom of an old sage. In this book he helps Matthew and his friends through their personal difficulties and in their day-to-day interactions with others. A number of issues arise throughout the book from first love and friendship problems, to low self-esteem, abuse, and racism. Evron is always there to guide the young people.

Not allowing herself to be distracted by the hot-as-sin former Australian commando who’s sent in to help and defend her will be infinitely more difficult.

When a charred body is discovered in a shallow grave on the ridge, officer Mattie Cobb and her K-9 partner Robo are called in to spearhead the investigation. But this is no ordinary crime--and it soon becomes clear that Mattie has a close personal connection to the dead man. Joined by local veterinarian Cole Walker, the pair scours the mountaintop for evidence and makes another gruesome discovery: the skeletonized remains of two adults and a child. And then, the unthinkable happens. Could Mattie become the next victim in the murderer's deadly game?

As a towering blaze races across the ridge, Cole and Robo search desperately for her--but time is running out in Margaret Mizushima's fourth spine-tingling Timber Creek K-9 mystery""--Publisher.

Dawn Vasquez never takes life too seriously. But when she rescues a golden retriever named Gigi, Dawn begins to imagine what it'd be like to settle down and let someone rely on her for a change. Unfortunately, Adam Dearborn―a handsome, hopelessly buttoned-up cattle rancher in need of a guide dog―has also fallen in love with the little ball of fluff and stubbornly insists that no other animal will do.    Adam isn't sure what drives him to fight to keep Gigi for himself, but he suspects it has something to do with his growing―and unfortunate―attachment to Dawn. Her whirlwind spirit and sunny disposition might make her a delight to be around, but they also make her unsuited for the difficult life of a rancher. He should be able to put her out of his head. But what's a love-struck cowboy to do when what he wants and what he needs have never seemed so far apart? And can he allow himself to take a chance on everything Dawn has to offer: puppy kisses, puppy love...and her.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The apparent heart attack that killed kennel owner Max Turnbull has left seven pups in mourning, and his wife Peg suspecting foul play. But the only evidence is their missing prize pooch--a pedigreed poodle named Beau.  Enter Melanie Travis. With her young son happily ensconced in day damp, the thirty-something teacher and single mother is talked into investigating her uncle's death--unofficially, of course. Posing as a poodle breeder in search of the perfect stud, Melanie hounds Connecticut's elite canine competitions, and finds an ally in fellow breeder Sam Driver. But her affection cools when she's put on the scent of Sam's questionable past...and hot on the trail of a poodle-hating neighbor and one elusive murderer who isn't ready to come to heel.  For, as Melanie soon discovers, in a championship dog-eat-dog world, the instinct for survival, and winning, can prove fatal.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They both love Stanley, an adorable but naughty Newfoundland...  When dog trainer Delilah Gould spots a rambunctious Newfoundland disobeying orders, she can't help but stepping in and teaching the gentle giant to heel. But it's his hunky owner she's really like to teach a few tricks. Too bad he's clearly the untrainable kind.  Professional hockey player Jason Mitchell is thrilled when he's traded to the New York Blades--the team of his dreams. There's just one problem: his pooch isn't adjusting to city life too well. Good thing he crosses paths with dog trainer Delilah Gould. At least that's what he thinks--until he realized he's fallen for her.  Now, with the season heating up, Jason realizes he'll have to score big-time to win the Stanley Cup and the woman who had tamed his dog and unleashed his heart.

With chapters on Four-Legged Family Members, The Common Bond, Teachers and Healers, and Unconditional Love, For the Love of Dogs reveals the many ways our dogs enrich our lives emotionally, physically, and spiritually. For example, Rocky is a trouble-making Golden Retriever pup who redeems himself when he saves an unsuspecting toddler's life; Hart is a Labrador who helps a traumatized teen find her voice; and Jazz is an agility dog whose fighting spirit and supportive family enabled her to beat her toughest competition--a cancer diagnosis. On the lighter side, there are humorous stories about dogs like Stewie, who was sold to his new owner as a purebred Yorkie. Soon, when this supposed 'toy breed' maxes out at twenty pounds, Stewie reveals his true identity as a $750 mutt. Even so, Stewie's owner doesn't mind the price, the pedigree, or sharing his postage stamp-sized place, because Stewie has captured his heart.

Inhaltlich widmete er sich vor allem der Landschaft, der Historie und Bildnissen seiner Studien- und Künstlerfreunde aus Heidelberg und Rom. Auffällig ist die häufig humorvolle Darstellung von Hunden in seinen Werken. In Fohrs Entwurf für das 'Gruppenbild der deutschen Künstler in Rom',0das an Raffaels Fresko 'Die Schule von Athen' anknüpft, platziert der Künstler gar seinen Hund Grimsel an die Stelle, die Raffael dem antiken Philosophen Diogenes vorbehalten hatte. Was den unkonventionellen Diogenes, Fohrs Hundebildnisse und seine eigene aufbrausende Natur miteinander verbindet, wird in diesem Band anhand einer Vielzahl von Abbildungen und eines fundierten wie unterhaltsamen Essays dargelegt, der aus der Feder des Fohr-Experten Peter Märker stammt.

The darling Paper Pup nearly moves this very practical mom to wondrous tears of joy over the magnificent effort her children put forth. Needless to say, it isn't long before the real pup arrives and stirs a once hum-drum household into a barrel of laughs.

Even the grumpiest of the grumpy can't help but be won over by her heart which is as fuzzy as her tail. This extraordinary pup has a secret power, you see -- it's called ""L-O-V-E.""

Wilson Steele is a single professor and Vietnam veteran who likes living alone, insisting it's too late for him to have a family. His mother disagrees. When she impulsively adopts a rescued black lab mix, she insists Thurman is special, and has whispered of the coming of grandchildren. Wilson brushes the notion off as fantasy. When his mother learns of her retirement community's 'no pets' policy, she forces Wilson to take the lovable dog. Wilson notices Thurman's growls do sound like words, but he knows he's just projecting his own thoughts on the animal. If Wilson is talking to neighbors on their walks, and spending time with Emily, a widow with three children, it isn't because Thurman encouraged him. After all, everyone knows dogs can't talk can they?""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Specific information is provided about the most important things for owners to start young to help their dog become old. Health, activity, sensory and behavior trends in youth, middle age and old age are covered, along with breed-related health problems.

Chaque opus s'ouvre sur une présentation des personnages et de leurs principaux traits de caractère et se conclut sur un jeu (charade, message à déchiffrer), ainsi que sur des suggestions d'activités pédagogiques liées à diverses sphères d'apprentissage. Sous ce titre : le jeune narrateur est fou d'Ali, le chien qu'il a reçu cadeau et qu'il désirait plus que tout au monde. Or, après quelques jours passés en sa compagnie, le garçonnet le soupçonne d'être sourd. Quelle autre raison expliquerait son refus d'obéir aux ordres? Et Ali est incontestablement le roi des bêtises : il mordille tout sur son passe, aboie la nuit, détruit le parterre du voisin et s'enfuit dès qu'il en a l'occasion. Avec l'aide de Madame Lespérance, directrice d'une école d'obéissance pour canins, le jeune maître réussira-t-il à éduquer son toutou avant que ses parents ne lui trouvent une nouvelle famille?  Entre humour et tendresse, un récit qui sensibilise les enfants aux responsabilités accompagnant l'adoption d'un animal. Des dessins de synthèse à saveur BD animent le texte d'un trait légèrement caricatural qui rend parfaitement l'énergie de la petite, mais diabolique, boule de poils! [SDM].

She?s not interested in boys, fashion, or the latest gossip, unlike her best friend Paige. Since her mom died, her stepdad, who she knows as Henry, has way too many complicated systems around the house but way too little to say about her mom?s death. To top it off, in her first year of middle school, Madison and her new friend Cooper have become the “school project” of a bully named Donald. And all she really wants is a dog to call her own, but all she gets is the parental-brush-off. What is a straight-talking, spunky middle grader going to do? Kids from ages nine- to twelve-years-old are sure to get a laugh from every page of Madison Morgan: When Dogs Blog, the young adult novel by author Pam Torres that charts the sometimes tough, frequently funny days of the wise-cracking, dog-loving Madison. When her dad arrives home with a foster dog, a scrawny brown terrier named Lilly, Madison is amazed to find she has an ability to understand dogs, their emotions, and often their pasts. However, this rare ability also leads her to uncover some extremely harmful activities that are happening right in her very own neighborhood. If she exposes the culprits behind them, she may risk losing Cooper, not to mention destroy her plan to remain invisible at school. As Madison struggles to feel normal and understand her ability to translate dog-speak, this coming-of-age story shares how one quirky young girl saves the day with the help of her father and their friend Netta at the Second Chance Rescue Shelter. Frank, funny, and full of adventure, Madison Morgan: When Dogs Blog is a must for any middle grader, who is certain to be enthralled by this dog blogger. --Amazon.com.

Or they ask you to buy into a complete system, with no variation from the trainer's program. But real world dog owners, often facing intractable behavior problems and unique canine personalities, need tips and techniques to make their lives better right now. And more and more dog owners are realizing that the traditional approach of dominance training through punishment is not only unpleasant to administer and potentially damaging to the dog, it is simply ineffective long term. With Training Your Dog the Humane Way, animal behaviorist and dog trainer Alana Stevenson set out to provide dog owners with a simple, accessible guide to the most effective positive dog training techniques she has in her arsenal. She provides readers with the basic principles of animal learning so that they can effectively prevent and remedy behavioral problems using a humane, positive approach rather than punishment. Alana provides easy-to-follow and highly effective methods and advice for teaching dogs polite manners and for resolving ongoing behavior issues. She provides solutions for such problems as house-soiling, play-biting, separation anxiety, fear of strangers, aggression, lunging while on leash, car sickness, and more. She teaches readers how to teach their dogs the way animals learn best, through kindness and benevolent leadership""--  After offering insights into how dogs interpret people and events, Stevenson teaches techniques that draw on this understanding to correct or prevent behaviors dog owners grapple with. Effective and caring, these methods strengthen the bond between dog and human, accentuating the pleasure and play that prompt dog guardianship in the first place.

In the beginning, Indiana Thunderbolt learned the ropes from her big sister, Harlow. She had no idea how things worked in her new family, but like any good older sibling, Harlow explained how they celebrated holidays, took family vacations, and remembered their sister, Sage who had gone on to doggie heaven before Indiana was born. Over time, Indi started to get the hang of it all, and she found herself growing up. In Harlow & Indiana (and Reese), it's Indi's turn to be a big sister when baby Reese arrives. Reese is tinier than Harlow and Indiana could ever have imagined, and they have a lot to get used to with a new sibling in the house. Narrated by the sassy and rabble-rousing Indiana, Harlow & Indiana (and Reese) is as adorable and charming as Harlow & Sage, filled with more jokes, more adventures, and even more sibling love than before. Richly illustrated with entirely new images of the highly photogenic pups, Harlow & Indiana (and Reese) is a new story about the furry friends that have captured hearts across the globe""--  ""New York Times-bestselling canines Harlow and Indiana, dubbed ""the most adorable best friends in the world"" by Buzzfeed, are back with a new addition to the family: Reese Lightning!""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Beautiful, astonishing creatures, countless numbers of them disappear each year once they can no longer compete and win. The Dogs of Avalon introduces us to the strong-willed Marion Fitzgibbon, born in rural Ireland, where animals are valued only for their utility. But Fitzgibbon believes that suffering is felt by all creatures, and she champions the cause of strays, baffling those around her--including her family--as she and a group of local women rescue any animal in need, embarking on increasingly risky missions. When Fitzgibbon becomes head of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and takes on the cause of the greyhound, she faces an entrenched racing industry protected by money and power. She joins forces with an American greyhound activist, a foxhunter's wife, a British aristocrat, and an influential German animal rescuer to create an international network to find these animals homes, confront the racing industry, and provide safe haven where animals can live in peace. The Dogs of Avalon brings forward the people on the other side of the track--Irish Travellers (a people whose Celtic history goes hack centuries), dogmen who hope to Win big--plus a host of animals on two continents: circus tigers in Ireland, wild monkeys in the Yucatan, dolphins in a marine animal park in Florida, and one very special Irish sight hound in New Jersey named Lily. In this potent David and Goliath story, Schenone's journey helps us understand our deep connection to animals and gives us inspiration in the form of the unforgettable Fitzgibbon, who grapples with compassion and activism and shows the difference we are all capable of making in the world.""--Jacket.

Without warning an insurgent popped up, his weapon raised. At the handler's command, the dog charged their attacker. There was the flash of steel, the blur of fur, and the sound of a single shot; the handler watched his dog take a bullet. During the weeks it would take the dog to heal, the handler never left its side. The dog had saved his life. Loyal and courageous, dogs are truly man's best friend on the battlefield. While the soldiers may not always feel comfortable calling the bond they form love, the emotions involved are strong and complicated. In War Dogs, Rebecca Frankel offers a riveting mix of on-the-ground reporting, her own hands-on experiences in the military working dog world, and a look at the science of dogs' special abilities--from their amazing noses and powerful jaws to their enormous sensitivity to the emotions of their human companions. The history of dogs in the US military is long and rich, from the spirit-lifting mascots of the Civil War to the dogs still leading patrols hunting for IEDs today. Frankel not only interviewed handlers who deployed with dogs in wars from Vietnam to Iraq, but top military commanders, K-9 program managers, combat-trained therapists who brought dogs into war zones as part of a preemptive measure to stave off PTSD, and veterinary technicians stationed in Bagram. She makes a passionate case for maintaining a robust war-dog force. In a post-9/11 world rife with terrorist threats, nothing is more effective than a bomb-sniffing dog and his handler. With a compelling cast of humans and animals, this moving book is a must read for all dog lovers--military and otherwise""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jack's a dog trainer and behavioural specialist - not to mention the ""main squeeze"" of smart and sexy, part-time medical examiner, Jamie Cutter.  That's why he's standing in a secluded cabin by a lake on an icy December evening, with Allison DeMarco lying dead on her kitchen floor, and her high-strung Airedale, Ginger, going ape in the corner.  You can't teach an old dog - or cop - new tricks, so this homicide has Jack hooked...especially since poor Ginger seems to be the only witness!  In a world of misbehaving mutts and pesky purebreds, a killer may be waiting to make Jack, Jamie, and their puppy-pals roll over and play dead.

She steals the neighbor's turkey, yanks down the Christmas tree, and destroys Mom's almost-finished giant crossword. Everyone is mad, and it looks as though June Bug's days are numbered. Will doing a good deed make up for June Bug's bad behavior? Nicola certainly hopes so. And when she and June Bug come across a new nursing home in the neighborhood, it feels like a sign. They volunteer to become regular visitors at Shady Oaks, certain that June Bug's cute tricks will cheer up the elderly residents. But something unusual is going on at the home, where it seems that a few of the more remarkable patients are being kept against their will. Freeing them will bring out the very best in Nicola, and especially in June Bug.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

En route to the title, Pudsey and his owner Ashleigh Butler won over Walliams, delighted Dixon, stole the heart of Holden, and utterly captivated Cowell. They charmed the nation, too - with millions of viewers tuning in to see them take the crown. But what do we really know of Pudsey's journey to stardom? How did he get from being a depressed dog to the mutt of the moment? In this, the most unusual celebrity book of the year, he's finally ready to tell his tale. As a young pup, Pudsey always knew he was somehow different to his dog-standard peers. While his brothers and sisters contented themselves with chasing their tails, he sat apart, yearning for something more. With the help of the menagerie of pets that fill the Butler household and despite some dastardly opposition threatening to stop him at every turn, Pudsey managed to achieve his dream. This Autobidography tells the story of his incredibly journey, straight from the dog's mouth.""--Publisher's description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They became attached to each other, and Kerasote decided to name the dog Merle and bring him home. There, he realized that Merle's native intelligence would be diminished by living exclusively in the human world. He put a dog door in his house so Merle could live both outside and in. This portrait of a remarkable dog and his relationship with the author explores the issues that animals and their human companions face as their lives intertwine, bringing to bear the latest research into animal consciousness and behavior as well as insights into the origins and evolution of the human-dog partnership. Merle showed Kerasote how dogs might live if they were allowed to make more of their own decisions, and Kerasote suggests how these lessons can be applied universally.--From publisher description.

So when long-suffering Brandy Borne is rudely awoken by her eccentric mother, Vivian, and invited on a surreptitious shopping trip, the idea is less than tempting. But if Vivian - Serenity's true-crime writing, septuagenarian super-sleuth - has a nose for sniffing out antiques, Brandy's sense of smell is just as good . . . and trouble's on the wind.A little light blackmail and one run-in with the police later, and Brandy and Vivian are the 'proud' owners of a selection of dead stock, liberated ahead of an upcoming warehouse sale from unsavory auctioneer Conrad Norris. Brandy's not convinced there's a fortune to be made in vintage toys, retro plates and pearl buttons - there's more mileage in their shop's new Halloween display, even though it's only August - but she supposes it could be worse.It soon is. After the auction's taken place, Vivian and Brandy make an unnerving discovery. It's not just the stock that's dead - so is the auctioneer . . .This light-hearted, laugh-out-loud cozy mystery also features Brandy and Vivian's humorous tips for buying and selling antiques, along with a selection of tasty recipes.

Natalie herself resembles an Ibizan hound--quiet, playful, loyal, smart, and above all, obedient. Actually, Natalie has been trained so well that sometimes she thinks her mother is secretly controlling her with a dog whistle. (Her mom is a respected veterinarian with a successful clinic, so it's not that much of a stretch.)Just like the Ibizan, Natalie is very mindful of her master's rules, but at the first sign of freedom, she is prone to stray. And who can blame her when the gorgeous and mysterious Carver Reed comes to live with the Kaplan family for the summer? Little by little, Natalie is drawn to Carver's spontaneity and free spirit, and before long, she turns into another breed of girl, who surprisingly bites the hand that feeds her.""Stray is a winning novel that provides us with an important reminder: it's okay to make mistakes and break the rules, especially when it comes to love.""--Maureen Johnson, author of 13 Little Blue EnvelopesFrom the Hardcover edition.

When Hazel was debilitated with crippling back problems, she found herself unable to look after the house so she used her skills as an animal behaviourist to teach Connie, her seven-month-old Newfoundland, how to do the work instead. Connie picks out items of dirty clothing from the laundry basket and places them inside the washing machine. When the washing cycle is over, Connie transfers the clean clothes to the tumble dryer. Hazel could leave Connie to complete the entire task unsupervised; if only Connie understood that dark colours must not be washed with whites.

Now, in The Pawprints of History, the stories themselves are the focus and readers have the undiluted pleasure of sharing in Coren's unique trove. A lighthearted romp through the ages with a special eye out for man's best friend, Coren's vignettes of dogs in the great dramas of human history are a delight. As history's great figures strut across the stage, Coren guides us from the wings, lovingly picking out the canine cameos and giving every dog of distinction its day. He vividly depicts the dogs who have played a significant role in the lives of many historical figures, and shows how their relationships with their people have directly influenced the course of world events. In this unparalleled chronicle, we see how Florence Nightingale's chance encounter with a wounded dog changed her life by leading her to the vocation of nursing. We learn why Dr. Freud's Chow Chow attended all of his therapy sessions and how the life of the fifth Dalai Lama was saved by a dog who shared his bed. We see the obsessive love of King Charles II, who gave his spaniels hereditary titles of nobility so that they might go with him into the House of Lords. From canines who accompanied the rulers of ancient Egypt to those belonging to the presidents of the United States, dogs have been companions as well as political symbols and instruments of public relations -- including Calvin Coolidge's collie Prudence Prim, who had a cheerful collection of fancy hats, and Bill Clinton's chocolate Lab, Buddy, who made timely appearances to help his master through photo ops. Even when the four-footed witnesses are not the decisive characters, it is gratifying to know that, for instance, in the thick of the Battle of Germantown, George Washington called a cease-fire solely to return General Howe's beloved fox terrier, who had wandered out of Howe's tent and across enemy lines. When the Earl of Wilshire's springer spaniel nipped the Pope's toe, he may not have precipitated the English Reformation, but he certainly didn't help matters. From war to art, across the spectrum of human endeavor and achievement, there often stands, not only at his side but leading the way, man's beloved ""best friend."" In this definitive collection of canine greatness, bursting with tales of famous figures and their four-legged catalysts of every breed and possible disposition, from lapdogs to four-legged warriors, from sleuthing hounds to sedentary pugs, Coren convincingly documents that wherever are found the footprints of history, there to one will find the pawprints. - Jacket flap.

A problem pup who flourishes under the right kind of training. The struggling veteran who finds unconditional love wiggling around at the end of a leash. The lonely child who finds comfort in the steady breathing of the warm, furry friend at her side. Each of us needs to be rescued from something--and each of us has the capacity to rescue someone, or something, else.  This collection of more than thirty contemporary, true, feel-good stories spotlights the beauty of being rescued--dogs rescued by people, people rescued by dogs, and even dogs who rescue other animals. It's the perfect companion--well, besides the four-legged, tail-wagging kind--for your morning cup of coffee or an evening curled up on the couch. Contributors include Susy Flory, Dusty Rainbolt, Lauraine Snelling, Melody Carlson, Wanda Dyson, Suzanne Woods Fisher, and many more.

These memoirs read as a novel, and describe in fierce detail the behavior, feelings and psychology of Mann’s dog Bashan, and of Mann himself. Mann tells how he acquired Bashan, details traits of his character, and describes how they go on harmless and bucolic hunts. Written in 1918 at the end of the First World War, Bashan and I is an ode to life, to nature, to simple joys, and to a dog.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But no, they looked to the New World for their extraordinary new adventure... No-one has ever sailed an English narrowboat in the US before, for reasons that become clear during the 9-month voyage of the Phyllis May - including 30-mile sea crossings, blasting heat, tornadoes, hurricanes and all manner of intimidating wildlife. But the real danger comes from the Good Ole Boys and Girls of the Deep South. Colonels, bums, captains, planters, heroes, drunks, gongoozlers, dancing dicks and beautiful spies - they all want to meet the Brits on the painted boat and their thin dog and take them home and party them to death. And from the Phyllis May, a thousand miles of the little-known South-East Seaboard unfold at six miles an hour- the golden marshes of the Carolinas, the incomparable cities of Charleston and Savannah, and the lost arcadias of Georgia and Florida.Beautifully written, lovingly observed, and very funny, Narrow Dog to Indian River takes you on a dangerous, surprising and always entertaining journey.

Passed on through the generations from his ancestor Pug-tzucompanion to the philosopher and author of the Tao Te Ching, Lao-tzuthe wisdom of the Tao has helped Wilson lead a simple, peaceful, and fulfilling life.  Deciding it was time to share this spiritual knowledge, Wilson enlisted the help of his owner (and photographer), Nancy Levine, to bring you The Tao of Pug. Each photograph captures Wilson's charm and humor as he illustrates the timeless principles of the Tao Te Ching with examples from his active life alongside quotes from the original text. With his adorably expressive face, funny poses, and trademark yin-yang coat, Wilson has an unmistakable magnetism that has won him countless admirers, of all canine and philosophical persuasions.  Wilson's comical lessons on life pair beautifully with Levine's delightful photographs to make The Tao of Pug a must-have book for pug lovers of any age.""--Publisher's description.

"The Land That God Gave Cain: An account of H.G.Watkins' Expedition to Labrador, 1928-1929",J. M. Scott,dogs,First published in 1933,/works/OL16797727W,/authors/OL126593A/J._M._Scott,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1933|Publisher  Chatto and Windus,"This book describes the experiences, primarily, of Gino Watkins and Jamie Scott, on the former’s expedition to Labrador in 1928 and 1929.  It was the second expedition which Watkins had organised (the first had been to Edge Island in Spitsbergen in 1927) and its objective was to explore and map the unknown interior of southern Labrador (known colloquially by the book’s title) on foot, by canoe, in motor boats, and with dog sledges. The pair later went to Greenland, respectively as the leader and a member of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition of 1930-31. Watkins, by then a highly respected Arctic explorer, returned to Greenland in 1933 and drowned there when his kayak capsized. Jamie Scott married Gino’s sister Pamela, wrote the biography “Gino Watkins,” and in 1953 also published “Portrait of an ice-cap” about his Greenland experience.  On the first part of the Labrador expedition, Watkins and Scott were accompanied by Lionel Leslie – who gave his own account of the experience in the  book “Wilderness trails in three continents” (1931). They established their base at the settlement of North West River in July, 1928, and the pair spent nine months in Labrador, travelling about 800 miles by water and 1500 miles by sledge.  The book gives a full and vivid account of where they went (there are two detailed maps with twenty black-and-white photographs) and how they travelled, with an account of the earlier exploration and descriptions of the trappers, Indians and Eskimos that they met.  It was mostly written while Watkins was still alive, and with his encouragement, but, having been completed after his death, it includes a lot of comments that place on record what an exceptional leader he was. It is a good account also of how the pair learned the techniques of dog sledging in wild, mountainous and wooded terrain, and of the how the experiences and hardships shaped Watkins as a polar expert and expedition leader. In his short life he nurtured and inspired a number of people who laid the foundations for several decades of  systematic exploration and mapping of  British Antarctic Territory using dog teams initially obtained, via links back to Watkins, in that same part of Labrador.

When the last of their aged 4-legged animal ""kids"" passes away, Lou Spirito and his wife go looking for a rescue dog. Although he insists that he's open to any dog in need, Lou secretly longs for a dog like Rebel, the rollicking Irish Setter that shared his world when he was a struggling actor living the vida loca of sex, drugs, & disco in the wonderland of New York City. He longs for a jaunty dog to transport him back to the carefree days before mortgages, life insurance and missed opportunities ... the last thing on his wish list is a frightened, muscle-bound, scarred, and carsick Pit Bull. In contrast to his fun-loving predecessor, Tanner is an emotional Geiger counter. He cowers at strange objects, flinches at loud noises, and vomits whenever he is stressed - which is most of the time. And why shouldn't he? His immature new owner, Lou, is a raging bull! Having honed anger to an art form over his lifetime, Lou constantly storms and curses at the slightest provocation--misplaced keys, computer glitches, even mayo on a turkey sandwich (don't ask). Unlike Marley and John Grogan, Lou's is a case of 'good' dog vs. 'bad' owner. For this odd couple to flourish, one of them will have to change. And fast. Thankfully for the writer, the dog wins out. It isn't easy. It isn't always pretty.""--Back cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At loose ends with her daughter leaving home and her husband on the road, Sue Halpern decided to give herself and Pransky, her under-occupied Labradoodle, a new leash--er, lease--on life by getting the two of them certified as a therapy dog team. Smart, spirited, and instinctively compassionate, Pransky turned out to be not only a terrific therapist but an unerring moral compass. In the unlikely sounding arena of a public nursing home, she led her teammate into a series of encounters with the residents that revealed depths of warmth, humor, and insight Halpern hadn't expected. And little by little, their adventures expanded and illuminated Halpern's sense of what virtue is and does--how acts of kindness transform the giver as well as the given-to. Funny, moving, and profound, A Dog Walks into a Nursing Home is the story of how one faithful, charitable, loving, and sometimes prudent mutt--showing great hope, fortitude, and restraint along the way (the occasional begged or stolen treat notwithstanding)--taught a well-meaning woman the true nature and pleasures of the good life. ""--  ""A layabout mutt does a second act as a therapy dog working with the infirm and the aged, and fetches from that clarifying, life-and-death realm an inspiring sense of the core human virtues - love, fortitude, justice, charity, prudence, restraint, hope, and fun - and how to live them now.""""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Born in London in 1875. An extremely prolific author, mainly of adult romances and general girl's adventure stories with romantic elements. She was also a tireless church-worker and used the proceeds from many of her books in her endeavours.  As far as I know only wrote three pony books: a pair of books about Exmoor ponies Heather and co. in the typical 'pony-point-of-view' style of the time, plus one other horse story. The first book was actually written before the 1920s so has the claim to fame of being one of earliest ever pony books!  She was pioneering as one of the first women to write science fiction (under the psuedonym of Lester Lurgan)  including a novelization of a silent film, Message From Mars. Also wrote under the name of Bryan Smith.--http://maywynne.ponymadbooklovers.co.uk/      May Wynne is a pseudonym for Mabel Winifred Knowles, prolific author of 211 books published between 1899 and 1954, as well as many short stories. Her works include thrillers, romances, adventures, historical and guide stories, didactic and religious pieces, and girls' school stories.  A Church worker at the Anglican mission parish of St Luke’s, Victoria Docks, Knowles used the proceeds from her writing career to fund mission activities. During the peak of her career, she wrote as many as eight books a year.--goodreads51082568   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But when Tipper returns with a bloodstained boating cap in his teeth, the ex—New York cop decides to investigate and finds an anonymous dead body clutching the tennis ball Jack tossed away moments before.

More than this, the Border collie demonstrates an uncanny sensitivity to, and tenderness towards, humans who are troubled or ill.  Izzy's unusual gift leads Jon off the farm and into new, extraordinary friendships, as they together begin volunteer hospice work. Izzy shows Jon what dogs can do for people at our most desperate times. But the work isn't easy, and Jon is reminded that at times he is needy himself.  Enter Lenore, a glossy jet-black Labrador retriever puppy, whose seemingly boundless capacity for love reminds Katz why he'd come to the farm in the first place - and why he'd devoted so much of his life to working with dogs.  The Dog who Loved is a moving and inspiring story of love, compassion, and the incredibly rich and complex relationships between dogs and humans.

In Top Dog, Maria Goodavage takes readers into the life of Lucca K458, a decorated and highly skilled military working dog. An extraordinary bond develops between Lucca and Marine Corps dog handlers Chris Willingham and Juan Rodriguez, in what would become a legendary 400-mission career. A Specialized Search Dog, Lucca belongs to an elite group trained to work off-leash at long distances from her handler. She served alongside both Special Forces and regular infantry, and became so sought-after that platoons frequently requested her by name. The book describes in gritty detail Lucca's adventures on and off the battlefields, including tense, lifesaving explosives finds and firefights, as well as the bravery of fellow handlers and dogs they served with. Ultimately we see how the bond between Lucca and her handlers overcame the endless brutalities of war and the traumas this violence ignites.

Whereas kennels in the US take up at least half of the book, kennels in the UK are confined to a few very small entries that take up less than five pages. Another thing is that this book is more about the rough collie than the smooth, with most of the photographs showing rough collies.    The care information is, at best, generic, and more in-depth information can be found on the Internet.    This is still a very good book, despite its faults, and I'd recommend it more to a beginner (maybe someone who doesn't have a collie but wants to learn a bit about the breed) than someone interested in showing or breeding their collie.

But the story behind the dog is even tastier ... Fleeing Eastern Europe as the shadow of WWI looms large with nothing but twenty dollars in his socks, Nathan arrives in New York with the insatiable desire to make a better life, and within two years he sets up a shop of his own, hawking frankfurters for five cents at the sleepy little beach retreat of Coney Island. As New York booms, pushing trains and patrons to the shore, so too do Nathan's humble hotdogs. Within ten years he has the whole corner, and a brand as recognizable as Coca-Cola and Cracker Jack. Nathan's is famous. But with success comes difficulties, and as Nathan's two sons vie to inherit the family dynasty a story of Biblical proportions plays out, mirroring the corporatization of the American food industry. Written by Nathan's own grandson, and at once a portrait of a man, a family and the changing face of a nation through a century of promise and progress, Famous Nathan is a dog's tale that snaps and satisfies with every page""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

American coyotes have learned that there's more food in cities than in forests and fields. Coyotes are smart, resourceful dogs. All around the world, other wild dogs are making the best use of their sharp minds and amazing skills. In South America, when a bush dog jumps into the water, it swims like an otter with its webbed feed. It fishes like one, too. The beautiful dhole dogs of India move into holes left by porcupines and redecorate them to their liking. The raccoon dog of China hibernates in the winter until the snow melts. Wild Dogs of the World tells you fascinating stories about all nine species of wild dogs, including the dingo dogs of Australia, maned wolves of South America (they're really dogs), painted dogs and jackals of Africa, and singing dogs of New Guinea. Each chapter is full of colored photos. As a dog lover, you can open the pages of Wild Dogs of the World and read about the lives of wild dogs on every continent but Antarctica. You'll be surprised at how much they're like your dogs at home. They're smart, funny, loyal, cuddly when they want to be, and fierce when they need to be. The fascinating stories of wild dogs will make you appreciate your own dog more. If you see your cat and dog chasing a squirrel together, you'll remember reading the story of how coyotes team up with badgers to chase and catch field mice. Wild Dogs of the World tells tales of romance, hunting, family life, and survival. It's a cliff-hanger for readers from 10 to 100""--Amazon.com.

Touching, absurd, and darkly comic, Allie Brosh’s highly anticipated book Hyperbole and a Half showcases her unique voice, leaping wit, and her ability to capture complex emotions with deceptively simple illustrations.  This full-color, beautifully illustrated edition features more than fifty percent new content, with ten never-before-seen essays and one wholly revised and expanded piece as well as classics from the website like, “The God of Cake,” “Dogs Don’t Understand Basic Concepts Like Moving,” and her astonishing, “Adventures in Depression,” and “Depression Part Two,” which have been hailed as some of the most insightful meditations on the disease ever written.  Brosh’s debut marks the launch of a major new American humorist who will surely make even the biggest scrooge or snob laugh. We dare you not to.  FROM THE AUTHOR:    This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative—like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it—but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:  Pictures    Words    Stories about things that happened to me    Stories about things that happened to other people because of me    Eight billion dollars*    Stories about dogs    The secret to eternal happiness*  *These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!   Read more Read less",80 Want to read|2 Currently reading|38 Have read

Co.|Language English|Pages 240,"""The Kuligowski family shares with its readers their memorable experiences (with accompanying photographs) of more than sixty years of pet rescue in New Mexico.  After becoming part of the Kuligowski household, many of their rescue dogs earned an impressive array of accomplishments.  One became the number one agility Pug in AKC competition in the USA.  Another, a Parti-Cocker Spaniel, was awarded 'For the Love of Children Pet of the Year.'  Pictures and feature stories of others were carried in both local and national publications.  Several of their blind and/or deaf canines were certified as therapy dogs and visited local nursing and senior homes on a scheduled basis.  Five traveled for over ten years to hundreds of classrooms across New Mexico, teaching pet care and training to both students and adults for the curriculum 'You and Your Pet Are Forever.'  The rescue of an escaped bait dog, Turner, and the heart-wrenching medical and emotional trauma that followed exposes us to the ugly, brutal world from which he came, dogfighting.  Turner was the reason this book was written.  This book is not just a collection of heartwarming stories, as this family also seeks to seriously involve the reader, asking their help in pursuing stronger animal humane legislation.  After stating the current laws and regulations governing animal safety and animal cruelty, they ask you to carefully examine the existing laws regarding the issues in your communities--be aware of how your city officials, state and federal legislators voted.  For the sake of your pet, of all pets, become involved.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
