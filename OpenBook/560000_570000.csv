It begins with an invitation to solve a series of poetic riddles: ""Of course you have a body, / But do you have a clue / Where all the body parts you've got are found / And what they do?"" Each poem that follows poses a puzzle in verse (with a sly wink and a nod to Shakespeare) and provides hints for uncovering the body part in question. Sidebars further educate readers about the anatomical subject in question, while appended notes offer a crash course on poetic form and a few facts about the Shakespearean works that inspired the verses. Captivating lines such as ""rumble, grumble, roil and rumble, / Acid burn and slurry tumble"" (from the poem that refers to the stomach) should spark readers' interest in poetry and human biology alike.

Watts|Language English|Pages 127,"An overview of vaccinations, explaining some basic terms, their development, with an emphasis on smallpox and polio vaccines, their current and future use, controversies concerning their use, and possible negative effects.  An overview of vaccinations, explaining some basic terms, their development, with an emphasis on smallpox and polio vaccines, their current and future use, controversies concerning their use, and possible negative effects. At one time, there were no vaccines to protect people against disease. People who became ill with diseases such as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, and mumps sometimes died. If they survived, they suffered lasting ill effects, such as paralysis, muscle weakness, and pneumonia. This began to change in the 1700s. The first vaccines prevented people from developing smallpox, a deadly disease. In 1796, an English doctor named Edward Jenner showed that cowpox, a similar but relatively harmless illness, could be used to protect people against smallpox. This disease has been completely eliminated -- the last naturally occurring outbreak of smallpox occurred in 1977. Vaccines are a safe and inexpensive way to protect people against disease. The practice of vaccination has made certain illnesses almost a thing of the past. Serious diseases that can be prevented by vaccination include hepatitis, tetanus, whooping cough, and chickenpox. Vaccines against HIV and cancer may become a reality in the future. Scientists are now developing and testing vaccines to protect people from these devastating illnesses. You probably associate vaccinations with shots, but not all vaccines are injected. For example, the Sabin vaccine, which prevents polio, is an oral vaccine. In the future, some vaccines may be delivered in foods, such as bananas and potatoes. Vaccines aren't perfect. No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and some people get a disease even after they have been vaccinated against it. Some people think vaccines are dangerous. True, they do cause serious reactions in a small number of people, but the benefits far outweigh the risks.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A world map allows children to name and locate the world's seven continents and five oceans. Each spread focusses on a different continent, looking at how many countries are in it, and some key facts about that continent, such as famous geographical features, for example the Iguazu Falls in South America, the climate, and the food. At the back of each book is a quiz which requires children to go back through the text and find the answers - encouraging them to think about, and engage with, what they have read. The information is presented in manageable chunks, making the book both highly accessible and ideal for project work.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Generation Cricket: Global Cricket looks at the game in all its many forms, from T20 and test matches to One Day Internationals, Kwik Cricket and even beach cricket. The book explains how cricket has evolved from a game for the elite to one that is played by millions of people, in many different ways, all over the world. It also focuses on some of the most famous competitions in cricket, from the IPL and Twenty20 World Cup to the Ashes and the ICC World Cup and Women's World Cup. All of the ten current Test Nations are detailed, along with their rivalries and some of their most impressive recent performances. Star Player features provide information about the men and women at the top of the sport both now and in the past, including Sachin Tendulkar, Ellyse Perry, Kieron Pollard, Virat Kohli, Kumar Sangakkara and Sir Donald Bradman. A comprehensive guide to the many competitions, leagues and teams in the world of cricket, Generation Cricket: Global Cricket is ideal for cricket lovers aged 9 and above, either for project work or simply as a great leisure read.
