Housing is a major purchase requiring long-term financing, and the factors that are associated with well functioning housing finance systems are those that enable the provision of long-term finance. Across all countries, controlling for country size, we find that countries with stronger legal rights for borrowers and lenders (through collateral and bankruptcy laws), deeper credit information systems, and a more stable macroeconomic environment have deeper housing finance systems. These same factors also help explain the variation in housing finance across emerging market economies. Across developed countries, which tend to have low macroeconomic volatility and relatively extensive credit information systems, variation in the strength of legal rights helps explain the extent of housing finance. We also examine another potential factor--the existence of sizeable government securities markets--that might enable the development of emerging markets' housing finance systems, but we find no evidence supporting that.

The stock market and the financing of corporate growth in Africa,Charles Amo Yartey,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL12741785W,/authors/OL5712827A/Charles_Amo_Yartey,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2006|Publisher  International Monetary Fund, Research Dept.|Language English|Pages 42","This paper examines the corporate financing pattern in Ghana. In particular, it investigates whether Singh's theoretically anomalous findings that developing country firms make considerably more use of external finance and new equity issues than developed country firms to finance asset growth hold in the case of Ghana. Replicating Singh's methodology, our results show that compared with corporations in advanced countries, the average listed Ghanaian firm finances its growth of total assets mainly from short-term debt. The stock market, however, is the most important source of long-term finance for listed Ghanaian firms. Overall, the evidence in this paper suggests that the stock market is a surprisingly important source of finance for funding corporate growth and that stock market development in Ghana has been important.

Readers will delight in the astonishing history of these individuals: the surgeon who joined in the 1797 Mutiny of the British fleet and was transported to Sydney, who then developed the largest medical practice in the colony and became a major landowner; one of the most famous Australians who allegedly amassed his wealth by getting officers and small landholders drunk at his public house and then allowing them to sign away their rights to their possessions as security for their debts; the director of the Bank of New South Wales who committed suicide due to a bad case of depression and gout; the pronounced lunatic' who got into constant strife with the governor; the grazier who was stabbed in the groin with a pair of sheep-shears; one of Australia's richest ever women and the great mystery surrounding her.With detailed information on how they made their money and what sort of people they were and are, The All-time Australian 200 Rich List paints a lively portrait of these distinctive individuals. Some of them were transported as convicts, others had de facto relationships with convicts, and yet as a group they became the nation's wealthiest people and formed the very foundation of our traditional ideas about how Australian history and its economic development were created.Professor William D. Rubinstein has 14 books to his credit, including Men of Property: The Very Wealthy in Britain Since the Industrial Revolution (Rutgers University Press, 1981), The Jews in Australia (AE Press, 1986) and Jews in the Sixth Continent edited by W.D. Rubinstein (Allen & Unwin, 1987). He holds the Chair in History at the University of Aberystwyth (Wales) and previously held academic posts at the Australian National and Deakin Universities.

Over your lifetime, sticking to the long-debated ""Buy and Hold"" strategy will net you only average or below-average returns. Are you willing to settle for that? WHEN THE DOW BREAKS shows you not only how to identify market tops (protecting your stocks against significant losses) but also how to identify market bottoms (buying back in at or near the cheapest possible price).

Tetsuya Ishikawa's story reveals how a young Oxford graduate finds himself in command of vast sums of other people's money; how a novice to the mysteries of hedge funds, subprime mortgages and CDOs can fix complex deals for billions of dollars in the exclusive bars, brothels and trading floors of London, New York, Frankfurt and Tokyo, and reap the benefits in a colossal annual bonus and an international luxury lifestyle. Ishikawa's book, which deftly explains the arcane financial instruments now grimly associated with the credit crunch, is both a powerful tale of lost innocence and an expose of the disturbing truth of the collective folly, frailty and greed at the heart of the banking crisis. Tetsuya Ishikawa, Japanese by birth, grew up in London, and attended Eton College before reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. Throughout his banking career that included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and ABN AMRO, he structured, syndicated and sold Credit Derivative, CDO and Securitisation (including subprime) products to investors globally.

This monograph presents a framework to evaluate whether the stock market is in line with underlying fundamentals. This new and revised edition offers an up to date introduction to the controversy between rational asset pricing and behavioural finance. Empirical evidence of stock market overreaction are investigated within the paradigms of rational asset pricing and behavioural finance.

Even though we've all been affected by the calamity and have heard no shortage of news about it, it still seems unfathomable and utterly incomprehensible to most people that the actions of certain mortgage brokers, bankers, ratings agencies, and investment banks could break the economic engine of the world.  Now, for the first time, and in terms everyone can grasp, noted analysts and value investing experts Whitney Tilson and Glenn Tongue explain not only how it happened, but shows that the tsunami of credit problems isn't over. The second wave has yet to come. But if you know catastrophe is looming, you can sidestep the train wreck-and even profit. You just need to understand how bad times present opportunity and where to look. More Mortgage Meltdown can help you achieve this goal.  The book    Breaks down the complex mortgage products and rocket-science securities Wall Street created  Addresses how to find investment opportunities within the rubble and position your portfolio to take advantage of the crisis  Explains exactly how the combination of aggressive lending, government missteps, and Wall Street trading practices created the perfect economic storm  Shows you why the crisis is not yet over and what we can expect going forward    More Mortgage Meltdown can help you understand the events that have unfolded, and put you in a better position to profit from the opportunities that arise during these tough financial times.

Dr. Alexander Elder leads you into 16 trading rooms where you meet traders who open up their diaries and show you their trades. Some of them manage money, others trade for themselves; some trade for a living, others are on the semi-professional level. All are totally serious and honest in sharing their trades with those who would like to learn. You will meet American and international traders who trade stocks, futures, and options using a variety of methods. All are normally very private, but now, thanks to their relationships with Dr. Elder, you can see exactly how these traders decide to enter and exit trades. Each chapter illustrates an entry and an exit for two trades, with comments by Dr. Elder. With this book as your guide, you can get closer to mastering the key themes of trading--psychology, tactics, risk control, record keeping, and the decision-making process.   The companion Study Guide is filled with striking insights and practical advice allowing you to test your knowledge and reinforce the principles outlined in Entries & Exits.

This research is the highlighting of the Islamic financial system as a real possibility for a sustained and durable development. Considering the economic aspects, the analysis raises the dilemma of Islamic finance rules and its compatibility with global financial order. Also, it gave a great interest to the financial needs of the global society, that is a model penalized by practices such as usury, speculation and deregulation. Many countries belonging to the civil law or to the common law systems are using the Islamic capital, but denying Islamic finance a formal status. In the countries dominated by the conventional finance, population does not have the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of ""Sharia"" finance, because this opportunity remains inside the enclosure of the great cooperation. Through the analysis of these issues, the research tries to show the role that can play the Islamic finance in the global era, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the stability of finance global order and market""--Back cover.

Slash Your Retirement Risk redefines how to invest for retirement to maximize your reliable income and stabilize your financial future. Rather than the typical approach to portfolio management--focusing on returns and ignoring dramatic market downswings that can decimate portfolios--author Chris Cook shows investors how to create income reliability without sacrificing reasonable growth.

Chapter 14 The Financialization of Everyday Life,Léna Pellandini-Simányi,finance,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501527W,/authors/OL7884553A/Léna_Pellandini-Simányi,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Pages 23,"The term “financialization of everyday life” has become a buzzword in recent years. As it is often the case with buzzwords, the financialization of everyday life literature is informed by a variety of conceptual uses, theoretical traditions, and critical angles. This chapter provides an overview of this dynamic field. The first part looks at different definitions of the financialization of everyday life, contrasting three main uses of the term. The second part focuses on the commonalities across different stands of the financialization of everyday life literature and explains their shared starting point: the socio-economic processes associated with neoliberalism that are seen to have given rise to everyday financialization. The third part, in turn, discusses the differences between the main theoretical traditions as part of which the financialization of everyday life has been studied: (1) Foucauldian governmentality approaches that undoubtedly had the biggest impact on the field, (2) (cultural) economic sociology in a Weberian and Zelizerian tradition, (3) social studies of finance, and (4) the sociological study of inequality. The fourth part examines the critical angles used by each tradition, and the chapter concludes by considering the ways in which the field enables constructive criticism of contemporary finance.

Are you working to avoid these major retirement fails? Every day, people just like you, people who have worked hard and saved carefully for retirement, make decisions that will eventually crack their nest egg. Just because you added to your 401(k) or IRA plan every year, invested wisely, and amassed significant savings, you are not necessarily home free. Ready or not, your decisions all along the retirement path can positively or negatively affect your financial future. In Retirement Fail, top financial advisor Greg Sullivan shares the insights he has gained over his thirty-five-year career in wealth management to help you identify potential pitfalls and learn how to safeguard your hard-earned retirement assets. Because, contrary to what most people think, it is not poor portfolio performance that usually busts your retirement accounts. Rather, its the emotional decisions you make that can cause major problems. Whether its buying a vacation home that is beyond your reach, subsidizing your adult kids to a degree that is ill advised, or passing on the umbrella insurance your advisor recommended, the choices you make have an enormous effect on whether you'll be able to enjoy the comfortable retirement you've dreamed about. Retirement Fail: Lays out the nine common hazards that trip up otherwise well-prepared retirees, encouraging you to think through your decisions and set a course aligned with your values and your ultimate goals. Goes beyond traditional financial advice, using personal stories to illustrate how others have become mired in or solved these financial dilemmas. Creates a valuable framework you can use to chart your path or begin conversations with your advisor, so that you can act to protect your financial independence. The numerical side of financial planning is one thing, the far more difficult task is looking at the way the decisions we make impact our own future and those around us. Whether you are working with a financial advisor or are going it alone, Retirement Fail shows you the points you need to pay attention to and helps you figure out what your priorities are and what tradeoffs you may have to make in order to achieve them""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wealth without Wall Street,Sheldon Jacobs,finance,First published in 2012,/works/OL16263806W?edition=ia%3Ainvestingwithout0000jaco,/authors/OL461646A/Sheldon_Jacobs,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25095040M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Wiley|Language English,"""Five Steps outlines a different path to wealth creation. At the heart of the book are five essentials that any investor can quickly learn and put into use. Chapters on diversification, asset allocation, controlling risk and managing costs are there because you can't invest responsibly without that foundation. What is truly unique for this genre is the fifth principle, a discussion of how to use the media to make people better investors. Getting good advice is the name of the game, yet in most self-help investment books; the power of the media to improve investment results is ignored. If there is any mention of the media at all in these books, it is usually critical. That's shortsighted, because for almost all investors, the media is the best place to get money making advice. Five Steps discusses media in all its forms: newspapers, personal finance magazines, newsletters, books, radio, TV, and online. There are sections on selecting actively-managed funds and selecting a market timer. Almost everything that Sheldon recommends, he has tried himself. This includes a discussion on investing in a Broadway show--Sheldon once profited from a personal investment in Hairspray""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pourtant, comment expliquer sa remarquable résistance et sa capacité étonnante à différer l'inéluctable issue, alors que tant d'autres régimes moins décriés _ et de constitution apparemment plus robuste _ ont succombé pour bien moins? L'analyse du système fisco-financier de la vieille France à laquelle se livre Daniel Dessert et l'étude minutieuse du monde de l'argent apportent un éclairage nouveau sur ce problème. A partir de l'utilisation monétaire du métal précieux, de ses cheminements fiscaux et économiques, l'auteur propose une explication globale de l'Ancien Régime qui en renouvelle l'approche.  La descente dans l'univers de la maltôte découvre le monde des véritables protagonistes du jeu de l'argent, et révise bon nombre d'idées reçues sur leur identité. Les liens entre le Pouvoir et la Finance sont présentés sans fard, en particulier dans leur dimension sociale et politique. Ainsi, l'auteur propose une relecture radicale de l'oeuvre d'un Fouquet ou d'un Colbert. Mais, au-delà de l'histoire du Grand Siècle, cette étude de la fascination qu'exerce le métal précieux sur le royaume met en évidence des comportements spécifiques aux Français d'hier comme d'aujourd'hui et qui n'en finissent pas de nous interpeller.

In How Global Currencies Work, three noted economists provide a reassessment of this history and the theories behind the conventional wisdom. Offering a new history of global finance over the past two centuries, and marshaling extensive new data to test established theories of how global currencies work, Barry Eichengreen, Arnaud Mehl, and Livia Chiţu argue for a new view, in which several national monies can share international currency status, and their importance can change rapidly. They demonstrate how changes in technology and in the structure of international trade and finance have reshaped the landscape of international currencies so that several international financial standards can coexist. They show that multiple international and reserve currencies have in fact coexisted in the pastupending the traditional view of the British pound's dominance prior to 1945 and the U.S. dollar's dominance more recently. Looking forward, the book tackles the implications of this new framework for major questions facing the future of the international monetary system, from whether the euro and the Chinese yuan might address their respective challenges and perhaps rival the dollar, to how increased currency competition might affect global financial stability.""--Jacket.

The value of debt in retirement,"Anderson, Thomas J.

The Value of Debt in Retirement teaches you how incorporating debt into your retirement strategy may increase your return, lower your taxes and actually lower your risk. You read that right. If handled correctly, debt--that thing we've all been taught to avoid--can play an integral role in your life, especially in retirement. New York Times Best Selling Author and nationally acclaimed financial expert Tom Anderson shows you how to use the time tested strategies of the best companies and the ultra rich to retire comfortably, minimize taxes, buy the things you have always wanted to have and do the things you have always wanted to do.Thought provoking and against the grain, Anderson explains why your risk tolerance doesn't matter, why being debt free may actually increase your risk and why rushing to pay off your mortgage may be a financial disaster. Full of shocking revelations and tricks high- net-worth individuals have used for years, The Value of Debt in Retirement opens the world to a new approach to wealth management in retirement, one that factors in both sides of the balance sheet as an integrated ecosystem.Real-world case studies illustrate how informed debt strategies can lead to a happier, healthier retirement. See how an individual with a net worth of more than $5 million can spend $20,000 per month - after taxes - and pay less than $5,000 per year in taxes, how it is possible to increase your rate of return by 50%, and how a lower risk portfolio with debt could increase the chances you do not run out of money.Specifically written to Baby Boomers, practical guides and checklists show how to use debt strategies to fund primary and secondary properties, refinance credit card debt, and finance hobbies, such as cars and boats and recreational vehicles. Additional guides show how you can help your children, help your parents and leave a bigger legacy for your heirs and favorite charities. Regardless of your net worth, The Value of Debt in Retirement provides tools to use to apply these concepts to your personal situation.There is no free lunch: the book delivers a balanced perspective focusing on the potential risks and benefits of the strategies discussed. A discussion on economic history highlights some of the shocks the economy may face and provides important warnings that you should factor into your retirement plan. Anderson not only shows that your life expectancy may be longer than you think, but also illustrates that many investors may be on track to average returns well under 4% for the next ten years - a potentially devastating combination. Irrespective of your beliefs about debt, The Value of Debt in Retirement proves risk is more important than return for retirees and provides suggestions on ways to minimize that risk.Not all debt is good and high levels of debt are bad. The Value of Debt in Retirement is about choosing the right debt, in the right amounts, at the right time. Perhaps most importantly, this book isn't for everybody. This book requires responsible actions. If you can't handle the responsibility associated with the ideas then this book then it isn't for you. If you need a rate of return under 3% from your investments then you may not need this book. But if you can handle the responsibility and if you need a return above 3%, this book may offer insights into the best (and potentially only) way to achieve your goals""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Betrayal: the life and lies of Bernie Madoff,Andrew Kirtzman,finance,First published in 2009,/works/OL14909965W?edition=ia%3Abetrayallifelies0000kirt,/authors/OL1483996A/Andrew_Kirtzman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24011303M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers|Language English|Pages 307","It was an inconceivable deception: over $65 billion stolen in the world's largest Ponzi scheme. Including new and revealing interviews with those who worked closest to him and his family, Betrayal is an in-depth, penetrating look at the man who perpetrated history's most notorious financial crime. To the people who knew him, Bernie Madoff was a kind and honorable person; a loving father and husband; generous to his employees and charitable even to strangers. On Wall Street, he was known as a wise elder statesman, wildly successful in his investments but never too risky with people's money. He was so revered and trusted that thousands placed their life savings with him, and he in turn provided them with early retirements and affluent lifestyles. But on December 11, 2008, Madoff confessed that he'd lied to them all. The monthly financial statements he'd sent customers for decades were all works of fiction. Their money was gone. Despite the crush of media attention on Madoff's scam, little is known about Madoff himself. What could lead a seemingly good man to ruin the lives of everyone who ever cared about him? What caused Bernie Madoff to commit an unspeakable act of betrayal, bankrupting his family, his friends, his mentors, and thousands of investors who depended upon him for their livelihoods? Betrayal: The Life and Lies of Bernie Madoff is about the man who realized that he could have everything he wanted if he simply lied to the people who trusted him the most. Author Andrew Kirtzman tracked down more than a hundred people from Madoff's past, from the first girl he ever kissed to family members who played in his house as children; from his secretaries to his drivers; from traders at his company to his inner circle of friends. He pored through thousands of pages of court records; private e-mails; phone-conversation transcripts; and census, military, and immigration records. The result is a fascinating story about the rise of a deeply immoral man. Kirtzman describes Madoff's feelings of inferiority and humiliation as a child, and his obsession with making money to prove himself worthy as he grew older. He reveals Madoff's construction of a criminal enterprise at a young age, long before he's ever claimed it began. He paints a picture of a loving yet strange family that ran a multibillion-dollar corporation like a small family restaurant. He offers an inside look at life within the company and the characters who worked on the infamous seventeenth floor. He reveals the details of an underground flow of cash that no one has known about until now. And he chronicles the desperate moments leading up to Madoff's fall, from the perspective of the people who spent the last hours with him before his house of cards collapsed. - Jacket flap.

The battle is about winning the hearts, minds, and -- yes, the wallets -- of global investors. This battle is still running its course, and with the insights of industry veteran Richard Goldberg, who has had a front row seat, readers will gain a detailed understanding as to what, exactly, is going on within this dynamic arena, specifically the forces behind the shift of power from the old sell side gatekeepers to the new buy side players.   The book will play out in three acts: Act One will examine the instruments of change -- liquidity and financial technology -- along with their influence on the sell and buy sides. Act Two will look at the agents of change -- hedge funds, private equity, financial entrepreneurs, endowments, exchanges and sovereign wealth funds -- and their impact on the sell and buy sides. In Act Three, Goldberg will take out his crystal ball and walk through the strategic implications for the winners and losers in this battle, against the dramatic backdrop of the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting shakeup of global firms like Bear Stearns.   But Wall Street isn't simply about institutions or corporate battles. It's a landscape dominated by personalities. Goldberg's unique access to major players will bring this book to life with amazing anecdotes and stories about the financial generals who have left their mark in The Battle for Wall Street.

Cheyette in 1994 is a subclass of the general HJM framework with a time dependent volatility parameterization. This book addresses the above mentioned class of interest rate models and concentrates on the calibration, valuation and sensitivity analysis in multifactor models. It derives analytical pricing formulas for bonds and caplets and applies several numerical valuation techniques in the class of Cheyette model, i.e. Monte Carlo simulation, characteristic functions and PDE valuation based on sparse grids. Finally it focuses on the sensitivity analysis of Cheyette models and derives Model- and Market Greeks. To the best of our knowledge, this sensitivity analysis of interest rate derivatives in the class of Cheyette models is unique in the literature. Up to now the valuation of interest rate derivatives using PDEs has been restricted to 3 dimensions only, since the computational effort was too great. The author picks up the sparse grid technique, adjusts it slightly and can solve high-dimensional PDEs (four dimensions plus time) accurately in reasonable time.Many topics investigated in this book  are new areas of research and make a significant contribution to the scientific community of financial engineers. They also represent a valuable development for practitioners.​   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By engaging with recently developed methods of research and new areas of practice, this book investigates the political, economic, policy and geographic determinants of the development of financial markets. The volume examines the causality between financial development and aggregate private investment from an economic perspective. It also explores the consequences of political liberalization, focusing on the impact of institutional improvement on financial development. It studies what stimulates governments to initiate reforms aimed at boosting financial development, and analyses the determinants of carbon markets in developing countries from a geographic point of view.  This book is essential reading for all interested in economic and financial development, climate change, environmental economics, and applied econometrics.

His notion of 'elementary, worldly wisdom' - a set of interdisciplinary mental models involving economics, business, psychology, ethics and mangement - allows him to keep his emotions out of his investments and avoid the common pitfalls of bad judgment. Munger's system has steered his investments for forty years ... This book presents the essential steps of Munger's investing strategy, condensed ... from interviews, speeches, writings and shareholder letters, and paired with commentary from fund managers, value investors and business-case historians. Derived from Ben Graham's value-investing system, Munger's approach is straightforward enough that ordinary investors can apply it to their portfolios""--Publisher's description.

She dissects Obamacare and Democratic tax initiatives to show how they have hamstrung the average American. Then she shows us how to overcome these left-wing financial hurdles and grow our nest eggs, despite the political pickpocketing from Washington. Among the topics she tackles: how the progressive agenda has robbed Americans of their financial freedom, and how to get it back; how the open spigot of college loan dollars has encouraged college administrators to boost tuition each and every year; how, with a stroke of President Obama's pen, company-sponsored healthcare coverage was put on deathwatch, as companies abandon employee healthcare coverage; why the knee-jerk progressive response to the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession has acted as an albatross on the shoulders of American corporations, keeping corporate tax rates at sky-high levels among Western nations--and what we can do to create jobs and jump-start the economy. For all those who want to take control of their financial future--from mastering the intricacies of the tax system to planning for their future retirement, from managing their healthcare costs to navigating the costs of their children's college education--this is the book you need to achieve the financial success you've earned and you deserve.--Adapted from dust jacket.

In this paper, we explore a set of features in which a benevolent government will rely on seigniorage. We use a simple overlapping generations model with return-dominated money. Money is valued because of a reserve requirement. The government has to raise a fixed amount of revenue solely for the purposes of making transfers to the old. It has two revenue-generating options: lump-sum taxes (money creation) under the control of the treasury (central bank). We restrict the amount of seigniorage collected to be nonnegative and require that the government's budget constraint be satisfied on a per-period basis. Our question is, Can we find stationary monetary competitive equilibria that are welfare maxima, given that the money stock cannot contract? Computational experiments reveal, somewhat surprisingly, that the answer is yes. Indeed, in our setup, benevolent governments may require that at least part, if not all, of the revenue be raised via money creation""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site.

The great inflation and early disinflation in Japan and Germany,"Nelson, Edward",finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL24060730W,/authors/OL1452835A/Nelson_Edward,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|Language English,"""This paper considers the Great Inflation of the 1970s in Japan and Germany.  From 1975 onward these countries had low inflation relative to other large economies.  Traditionally, this success is attributed to a stronger discipline on the part of Japan and Germany's monetary authorities--for example, more willingness to accept temporary unemployment, or stronger determination not to monetize government deficits.  I instead attribute the success of these countries from the mid-1970s to their governments' and monetary authorities' acceptance that inflation is a monetary phenomenon.  Symmetrically, their higher inflation in the first half of the 1970s is attributable to the fact that their policymakers over this period embraced nonmonetary theories of inflation""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site.

The result is that around a fifth of the world's population will receive much less rain than expected.What effect will this have?- A third of arable land going out of production, reducing yields and increasing prices.- A rise in seismic activity leading to more tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, which in turn cause climatic shifts.- A large increase in refugees forced to seek shelter in other countries.- Potential conflicts over water.- An immediate need to reduce the amount of water currently allowed to run to waste.- An urgent need to develop and invest in recycling, desalination and intelligent irrigation and new fuels, such as hydrogen and cold fusion.The authors address all of these issues and propose solutions to the problems we are about to face, or are already grappling with.This book sets out the power of water to enrich or destroy the lives of millions.

Real estate accounts for approximately two-thirds of the national wealth of the United States and over 25% of the gross domestic product. Experts attribute about 25% of the worth of publicly traded corporations to their investments in real estate. Recent studies by the Census Bureau and other organizations have identified real estate as the largest holding for a large percentage of households in the U.S. Clearly, issues surrounding real estate investing are of considerable interest to many parties including individual investors, institutional investors and even corporations who own real estate as part of their operations.

Cohort crowding,John Bound,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL10271051W,/authors/OL4228981A/John_Bound,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Analyses of college attainment typically focus on factors affecting enrollment demand, including the financial attractiveness of a college education and the availability of financial aid, while implicitly assuming that resources available per student on the supply side of the market are elastically supplied.  The higher education market in the United States is dominated by public and non-profit production, and colleges and universities receive considerable subsidies from state, federal, and private sources.  Because consumers pay only a fraction of the cost of production, changes in demand are unlikely to be accommodated fully by colleges and universities without commensurate increases in non-tuition revenue.  For this reason, public investment in higher education plays a crucial role in determining the degrees produced and the supply of college-educated workers to the labor market.  Using data covering the last half of the twentieth century, we find strong evidence that large cohorts within states have relatively low undergraduate degree attainment, reflecting less than perfect elasticity of supply in the higher education market.  That large cohorts receive lower public subsidies per student in higher education explains this result, indicating that resources have large effects on degree production.  Our results suggest that reduced resources per student following from rising cohort size and lower state expenditures are likely to have significant negative effects on the supply of college-educated workers entering the labor market""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Jobs are being cut by the tens of thousands. Real estate values are plummeting. Retirement plans and 401ks are going up in smoke. And then there's rising inflation. And whether we like it or not, higher gasoline prices again are right around the corner.Then there's the ever-present confusion and dips in the stock market, and, whether we want to admit it or not, the fact that the world is finally beginning to run out of essential raw materials, such as silver, titanium, and, of course, oil.  Yes, the economy is definitely a wreck. Even worse, according to most experts, our problems are not going away soon. We're going to be in serious financial trouble for a long time.So . . . are you ready for some good news?  As you will discover in GAME OVER, bestselling author and investment advisor Dr. Stephen Leeb shows you how to not only survive in the current economic maelstrom but actually find a way to thrive.   Dr. Leeb first tells you just how bad things are by exposing the basic suppositions of our institutions, and how quickly outdated they've become. Warning bells are sounding especially for Americans looking forward to a relaxing retirement and living off their savings, investments, Social Security, and Medicare. The time to sit up and take action is now.   Dr. Leeb provides a clear-cut and well-crafted financial road map to protect every investor in the years to come. Specifically, he reveals which key investments will steadily rise  . . . the best ways to hedge surging inflation . . . and which sectors will boom.  Many will lose their savings, watch their investments shrink, and never fulfill their financial dreams. But with Dr. Leeb's advice, you can make sure yours come true.

We propose that firms are motivated to sell these securities to minimize costs associated with asymmetric information.  We find that both the security structure and the investor composition of a PIPE security matter in the subsequent performance of the issuing firm.  Poor post-issuance performance is associated with securities where investors obtain significant repricing rights, which protect them from future stock price declines.  Furthermore, companies that obtain financing from hedge funds tend to under-perform companies that obtain financing from other institutional investors.  We argue that hedge funds act as investors of last resort, playing an important role in the market for young, high-risk firms with substantial asymmetric information.  Hedge funds are willing to fund such high-risk companies because they can protect against possible price declines in the issuing companies by either negotiating PIPE securities with repricing rights or by entering into short positions of the underlying stocks of the issuing companies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Using a structural life-cycle model nested in a switching regression with unknown sample separation, we find that roughly 70 percent of the elderly single population has a bequest motive that may or may not be active depending on the level of resources at a given age.  Both the presence and the magnitude of the bequest motive are statistically and economically significant.  All else being equal, households with an operative bequest motive spend between $4,000 and $9,000 a year less on consumption expenditures on average.  We conclude that, among the elderly single households in our sample, approximately half of bequeathed wealth will be due to a bequest motive""--Federal Reserve Board web site.

In this fresh take on Buffett's irrefutable investment methods, Robert Hagstrom shows readers how to apply Buffett's principles to technology and international investing using real-life case studies of successful fund managers like Legg Mason's Bill Miller.   Following the Buffett model, Hagstrom explains Buffett's four timeless principles: 1) analyze a stock as a business; 2) demand a margin of safety for each purchase; 3) manage a focus portfolio; 4) protect yourself from the speculative and emotional forces of the market. Then Hagstrom shows how Buffett's thinking can be applied in the new economy, addressing technology investing, international investing, small cap stocks, and socially responsible investing. Perhaps most valuable are Hagstrom's insights into the psychology behind Buffett's focus investing. For the first time, we are given sure-fire guidelines on how to become a winning Buffett disciple.   The Essential Buffett will include convenient sidebars featuring key Buffett ideas, enabling readers to quickly compare Buffett's fundamental tenets.

The international exposure of U.S. banks,Linda S.

U.S.  banks have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile flows to other regions of the world.  In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U.S.  banks have grown.  The foreign exposures of larger U.S.  banks tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows.  Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U.S.  bank cross-border and local claims.  The cross-border claims of U.S.  banks on European customers tend to be procyclical.  By contrast, locally generated and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U.S.  banks are not robustly related to either U.S.  or country-specific business cycle variables.  U.S.  banks do not appear to be strong conduits for transmitting U.S.  cycles to these smaller markets, and may instead serve a positive role in stabilizing the amplitude of foreign country cycles""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Bubbles and capital flow volatility: causes and risk management,Ricardo J. Caballero,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL4513818W,/authors/OL905298A/Ricardo_J._Caballero,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Emerging market economies are fertile ground for the development of real estate and other financial bubbles.  Despite these economies' significant growth potential, their corporate and government sectors do not generate the financial instruments to provide residents with adequate stores of value.  Capital often flows out of these economies seeking these stores of value in the developed world.  Bubbles are beneficial because they provide domestic stores of value and thereby reduce capital outflows while increasing investment.  But they come at a cost, as they expose the country to bubble-crashes and capital flow reversals.  We show that domestic financial underdevelopment not only facilitates the emergence of bubbles, but also leads agents to undervalue the aggregate risk embodied in financial bubbles.  In this context, even rational bubbles can be welfare reducing.  We study a set of aggregate risk management policies to alleviate the bubble-risk.  We show that liquidity requirements, sterilization of capital inflows and structural policies aimed at developing public debt markets ""collateralized"" by future revenues, all have a high payoff in this environment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Our GE model includes fundamental information that first manifests at the micro level and is not symmetrically observed by all agents. This produces foreign exchange transactions that play a central role in information aggregation, providing testable links between transaction flows, exchange rates, and future fundamentals. We test these links using data on all end-user currency trades received at Citibank over 6.5 years, a sample sufficiently long to analyze real-time forecasts at the quarterly horizon. The predictions are borne out in four empirical findings that define this paper's main contribution: (1) transaction flows forecast future macro variables such as output growth, money growth, and inflation, (2) transaction flows forecast these macro variables significantly better than the exchange rate does, (3) transaction flows (proprietary) forecast future exchange rates, and (4) the forecasted part of fundamentals is better at explaining exchange rates than standard measured fundamentals.

Long-run determinants of inflation differentials in a monetary union,Filippo Altissimo,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5893301W,/authors/OL1453617A/Filippo_Altissimo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper analyzes the long-run determinants of inflation differentials in a monetary union.  First, we aim at establishingsome stylized facts relating the regional dispersion in headline inflation rates in the euro area as well as in the main components of the consumer price index.  We find that a relatively large proportion of it occurs in the Service category of the EU's harmonized consumer price index (HICP).  We then lay out a model of a monetary union with fully flexible prices, the long-run properties of which are analyzed.  Our model departs in several respect from the Balassa-Samuelson hypotheses.  Our results are in contrast with the result that movements in the real exchange rate are mainly driven by regionally asymmetric productivity shocks in the traded sectors.  Our results point instead to relative variations in productivity in the non-traded sector as the primary cause of price and inflation differentials, with shocks to productivity in the traded sector being largely absorbed by movements in the terms of trade in the regional economies.  These shocks are also found to largely drive the variability of real wages at the country level""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Most solo consultants and boutique consulting firms are perpetually within six months of bankruptcy due to the sputtering unreliability of their new business engines. The problem, according to international consulting expert David A. Fields, is twofold: 1) lack of a consistent, proven plan, and 2) fundamental misunderstanding about what clients want in a consultant. Fields, who has helped hundreds of consultants and boutique firms worldwide build lucrative, sustainable practices, replaces the typical consultant's mindset of emphasising expertise and differentiated processes with a focus on building relationships, engendering trust, and solving clients' existing problems. In The Irresistible Consultant's Guide to Winning Clients, Fields synthesises his decades of experience into a step-by-step approach to winning more projects from more clients at higher fees."" -- Provided by publisher.

It is about a kind of conscious living that incorporates gratitude, a belief in abundance, and the experience of joy. Based on the recent discoveries of theoretical physics and a close reading of inspirational classics of the last century, Gikandi creates a new model for the creation of personal wealth; a new model that shows readers how to create abundance by saving, giving, offering charity, and building happy relationships. -- Publisher.

Slow passthrough around the world,Jeffrey A. Frankel,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL2142058W,/authors/OL268271A/Jeffrey_A._Frankel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Developing countries traditionally exhibit passthrough of exchange rate changes that is greater and more rapid than high-income countries, but have experienced a rapid downward trend in recent years in the degree of short-run passthrough, and in the adjustment speed.  As a consequence, slow and incomplete passthrough is no longer exclusively a luxury of industrial countries.  Using a new data set--prices of eight narrowly defined brand commodities, observed in 76 countries --we find empirical support for some of the factors that have been hypothesized in the literature, but not for others.  Significant determinants of the passthrough coefficient include per capita incomes, bilateral distance, tariffs, country size, wages, long-term inflation, and long-term exchange rate variability.  Some of these factors changed during the 1990s.  Part (and only part) of the downward trend in passthrough to imported goods prices, and in turn to competitors' prices and the CPI, can be explained by changes in the monetary environment.  Real wages also work to reduce passthrough to competitors' prices and the CPI, confirming the hypothesized role of distribution and retail costs in pricing to market.  Rising distribution costs, due perhaps to the Balassa-Samuelson-Baumol effect, could contribute to the decline in the passthrough coefficient in some developing countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Analysing this case within a gloabl context, Philip Haslam and Russell Lamberti investigate the causes of hyperinflation and draw ominous parallels between Zimbabwe and the world's developed economies. The looming currency crises and possible hyperinflation in these major economies, particularly the United States, have the potential to turn the current world order upside down. This story of how money destroys nations holds lessons that cannot be ignored.""--Back cover.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Global Forum is charged with in-depth monitoring and peer review of the implementation of the standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. These standards are primarily reflected in the 2002 OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters and its commentary, and in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and its commentary as updated in 2004, which has been incorporated in the UN Model Tax Convention. The standards provide for international exchange on request of foreseeably relevant information for the administration or enforcement of the domestic tax laws of a requesting party. ""Fishing expeditions"" are not authorised, but all foreseeably relevant information must be provided, including bank information and information held by fiduciaries, regardless of the existence of a domestic tax interest or the application of a dual criminality standard. All members of the Global Forum, as well as jurisdictions identified by the Global Forum as relevant to its work, are being reviewed. This process is undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 reviews assess the quality of a jurisdiction's legal and regulatory framework for the exchange of information, while Phase 2 reviews look at the practical implementation of that framework. Some Global Forum members are undergoing combined--Phase 1 plus Phase 2--reviews. The ultimate goal is to help jurisdictions to effectively implement the international standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. All review reports are published once approved by the Global Forum and they thus represent agreed Global Forum reports. For more information on the work of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, and for copies of the published review reports, please visit www.oecd.org/tax/transparency and www.eoi-tax.org.

The new frontiers of sovereign investment,Malan Rietveld,finance,First published in 2017,/works/OL19751772W,/authors/OL7539933A/Malan_Rietveld,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26964819M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Columbia University Press|Language English|Pages 296,"Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) can be effective tools for national resources revenue management. These state-owned investments, funded by commodity exports, foreign exchange reserves, or other national assets, are adaptable to the challenges posed by financial shocks and have been successfully employed in an increasing number of countries. The number of SWFs continues to grow, with the largest funds managing trillions of dollars in assets among them. However, given the significant variations among SWFs, it can be difficult to compare funds that differ in size, scope, and mandate. This book provides a sorely needed practical look at how these funds work--and how they should work. The New Frontiers of Sovereign Investment combines the insights and experience of academic economists and practitioners from several funds to survey a diverse financial landscape and establish the challenging topical questions facing a broad range of SWFs today: Should they serve both economic development and financial returns, and how? Will responsible investment enhance long-term returns? How can fiscal rules for SWFs be improved to meet emerging economic challenges? The book considers these questions as they apply to both long-established and newer SWFs. Featuring contributions from sovereign wealth practitioners from Alberta's AIMCo, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, as well as analysis by scholars at the forefront of sovereign investment, this volume provides timely and much-needed information on these rapidly evolving institutions.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At end 2004, the market size hit $6.4 billion (in notional amounts) from virtually nothing in 1995. This rise has been spurred by the imperative for banks to better manage their risks, not least credit risks, and the appetite shown by institutional investors and hedge funds for innovative, high yielding structured investment products. As a result, growth in collateralized debt obligations and other second-generation products, such as credit indices, is currently phenomenal. It is enabled by the standardization and increased liquidity in credit default swaps -- the building block of the credit derivatives market.   Written by market practitioners and specialists, this book covers the fundamentals of the credit derivatives and structured credit market, including in-depth product descriptions, analysis of real transactions, market overview, pricing models, banks business models. It is recommended reading for students in business schools and financial courses, academics, and professionals working in investment and asset management, banking, corporate treasury and the capital markets.   Highlights include:    Written by market practitioners and specialists with first-hand experience in the credit derivatives and structured credit market  A clearly-written, pedagogical book with numerous illustrations  Detailed review of real-case transactions  A comprehensive historical perspective on market developments including up-to-date analysis of the latest trends   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But the harsh reality is that the majority of crowdfunding campaigns fail-only 40% meet their goals. And failing means failing hard. If you fall short of your goal by the deadline, not only won't you see any of the money you've worked so hard to raise, but you might actually tarnish your shiny idea. In this book, Alex Daly shows you how to: build a deep fan base prior to launch; understand the psychology of why people give and create the right narrative around your project; find the right platform on which to raise funds; deal with unfulfilled promises and angry backers; create intimacy and promote shareability of your project; best use influence and exclusivity to get funded.

Yet politically, these countries are drifting further apart. In Seeing the Elephant, author and emerging markets expert Peter Marber describes how increasing economic integration and the rise of new actors is drastically altering the geopolitical landscape, and offers insights on how the US can maintain a leading role in the 21st century and beyond.   While America remains the single most important economy today, rising economic powerhouses -- China, Russia, India, Brazil and others -- bring a diverse set of interests to the table that the US cannot afford to ignore, Marber explains. Moreover, globalization has created thousands of non-state actors -- corporations, banks, hedge funds, activists and even terrorists -- who bring their own concerns to bear on the world system.   In the era of globalization, America's success hinges on the success of its neighbors, too. Yet from its invasion of Iraq to its disregard of major treaties -- some recent US choices have shown little regard for these new players. As the lines between economic, defense, environmental, immigration, and energy policy become increasingly blurred, having a holistic and coherent approach to cross-border challenges is essential. Yet the forums and institutions that once coordinated these relationships -- the UN, World Bank and the G7-- are losing relevance and no longer adequately represent the world's expanded power roster. To remain vital, Marber believes all our multilateral institutions will require fresh ideas and revamping.   Seeing the Elephant demystifies globalization, and analyzes the megatrends and interconnections of the 21st century. With bold suggestions on how America reassert its historic leadership in the new global arena, Seeing the Elephant should be required reading for policy makers, businessmen and informed citizens alike.

Intense competition between international currencies like the US dollar, Europe's euro, and the Chinese yuan is profoundly political, going to the heart of the global balance of power.  But what exactly is the relationship between currency and power, and what does it portend for the geopolitical standing of the United States, Europe, and China?  Popular opinion holds that the days of the dollar, long the world's dominant currency, are numbered.  By contrast, Currency Power argues that the current monetary rivalry still greatly favors America's greenback.  Benjamin Cohen shows why neither the euro nor the yuan will supplant the dollar at the top of the global currency hierarchy.  Cohen presents an innovative analysis of currency power and emphasizes the importance of separating out the various roles that international money might have.  After systematically exploring the links between currency internationalization and state power, Cohen turns to the state of play among today's top currencies.  The greenback, he contends, is the ""indispensable currency""--the one that the world can't do without.  Only the dollar is backed by all the economic and political resources that make a currency powerful.  Meanwhile, the euro is severely handicapped by structural defects in the design of its governance mechanisms, and the yuan suffers from various practical limitations in both finance and politics.  Contrary to today's growing opinion, Currency Power demonstrates that the dollar will continue to be the leading global currency for some time to come."" --Jacket flap.

And this time Becky Bloomwood and her credit cards are headed across the Atlantic....     With her shopping excesses (somewhat) in check and her career as a TV financial guru thriving, Becky's biggest problem seems to be tearing her entrepreneur boyfriend, Luke, away from work for a romantic country weekend. And worse, figuring out how to pack light. But packing takes on a whole new meaning when Luke announces he's moving to New York for business--and he asks Becky to go with him! Before you can say ""Prada sample sale,"" Becky has landed in the Big Apple, home of Park Avenue penthouses and luxury boutiques.     Surely it's only a matter of time until she becomes an American TV celebrity, and she and Luke are the toast of Gotham society. Nothing can stand in their way, especially with Becky's bills miles away in London.

University students are falling behind their international peers in attainment, while suffering from unprecedented student debt. For over a decade, the realm of American higher education has been wracked with self-doubt and mutual recrimination, with no clear solutions on the horizon. How did this happen? In this stunning new book, Christopher Newfield offers readers an in-depth analysis of the ""great mistake"" that led to the cycle of decline and dissolution, a mistake that impacts every public college and university in America. What might occur, he asserts, is no less than locked-in economic inequality and the fall of the middle class. In The Great Mistake, Newfield asks how we can fix higher education, given the damage done by private-sector models. The current accepted wisdom-that to succeed, universities should be more like businesses-is dead wrong.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The sector includes research universities, four-year colleges, two-year schools, and non-degree-granting career academies. Many institutions pursue mission-related activities that are often unprofitable and engage in profitable revenue raising activities to finance them. This book contains a good deal of original research on schools' revenue sources from tuition, donations, research, patents, endowments, and other activities. It considers lobbying, distance education, and the world market, as well as advertising, branding, and reputation. The pursuit of revenue, while essential to achieve the mission of higher learning, is sometimes in conflict with that mission itself. The tension between mission and money is also highlighted in the chapter on the profitability of intercollegiate athletics. The concluding chapter investigates implications of the analysis for public policy.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Will conservatives win the coming economic debate? The nation depends on it. We deserve to win, after all. We have the best economic ideas, so we say, aligned with constitutional liberty and the American Dream. The economy is in trouble, and after two terms of President Barack Obama the Democrats are mostly to blame.  After a crash like the 2008 financial debacle, the U.S. economy typically takes off on a seven-year boom. “Seven fat years” was the harvest of President Ronald Reagan, who entered office in the face of Cold War setbacks and sky-high interest rates, inflation, “malaise,” unemployment, and poverty.1 Pursuing similar policies in faint rhetorical disguise and correcting Reagan's second-term hike in capital gains tax rates, Bill Clinton delivered a seven-year echo boom of his own.  The Democrats now must answer the question: Why have Americans suffered seven years (and counting) of a famine of growth--the slowest recovery from recession in a hundred years? Why are jobs increasing more slowly than the job force is shrinking, with lower growth in wages and larger gaps in income and wealth than we have seen since the Great Depression? Why are productivity growth numbers at sixty-five-year lows, down to less than a quarter of the postwar average, and business starts actually in decline?

This groundbreaking book begins by comparing the stock market to a casino in which the house (public companies and the insiders who run them) buys and sells shares with the players (institutional and individual investors).  TrimTabs Investing argues that stock prices are primarily a function of liquidity--the amount of shares available for purchase and the amount of money available to buy them--rather than fundamental value.  Finally, it outlines the building blocks of liquidity theory and explains how you can use them to predict the direction of the stock market.   ""Charles Biderman, a savvy and battle-scarred veteran of the investment wars, has fashioned an intriguing approach to making money in the stock market that adroitly avoids both heavy-breathing speculation and the standard Wall Street practices that enable investors, big and small, to lose money in good markets as well as bad. Aimed at the sophisticated investor (which may or may not be an oxymoron), the book is written in blessedly straightforward prose and is a worthwhile read for anyone with an urge to have a fling at investing.--Alan Abelson   Barron's   ""Since the days of Joseph and Pharaoh, it has been axiomatic that the size of the grain harvest affects the level of grain prices; but today's investors have been slow to appreciate the fact that the supply of stock shares significantly determines the level of stock prices. Biderman's long overdue book outlines the theory and evidence behind 'Trading Float,' the actual--and exploitable--power behind major moves in the stock market. --Paul Montgomery   CEO and CIO of Montgomery Capital Management   ""'Trade as corporate execs do, not as they say.' Charles Biderman has built an impressive list of hedge fund clients from this essential insight, and this book does a great job explaining exactly how retail investors can incorporate it into their investing.""  --Eric Zitzewitz  Assistant Professor of Economics, Stanford Graduate School of Business   ""Charles Biderman is a smart thinker, clear writer--and he offers here some very interesting ideas. This book is for the little guy who enjoys reading about money and economics, even if he doesn't adopt the strategies offered here; and for the professional or sophisticated investor, who, to a greater or lesser degree, just might.--Andrew Tobias  author of The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Financial policies in these countries are seen as a component of a more general portfolio management policy in which the formation of an efficient domestic capital stock is a key objective.  Because intervention in financial markets is an important part of their development strategy, intervention in exchange and financial markets has, and we argue will continue to be, large and persistent enough to generate predictable deviations of exchange rates and relative yields in industrial country financial markets from normal cyclical patterns.  We argue that management of the currency composition of international reserves by emerging market governments and central banks is unlikely to alter these conclusions""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Opdyke,finance,First published in 2008,/works/OL5835607W?edition=ia%3Aworldisyouroyste00opdy_962,/authors/OL1430696A/Jeff_D._Opdyke,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL10353513M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 1, 2008|Publisher  Crown Business|Language English|Pages 288","How Jeff D. Opdyke became a successful international investor is an Everyman tale that began thirteen years ago when he discarded conventional wisdom. At the time, Wall Street's pros insisted that average investors buy domestic mutual funds that invest overseas. But Jeff ignored their tepid advice. Instead, he opted for the intrepid, opening bank and brokerage accounts from New Zealand to Hong Kong in order to buy the local stocks he wanted to own, not those that some fund manager deemed worthy.Jeff did so with great insight: People are people no matter whether home is in Madrid, Memphis, or Mumbai. They drink beer and buy homes and the furnishings and appliances to put in them. As hundreds of millions of people around the world strive to move into the middle class, the companies that meet these basic needs are becoming the great investment opportunities of today and tomorrow. Only a fraction of them, however, trade on American stock exchanges. So, armed with simple tools available to you and me (the Internet and an e-mail account), Jeff found companies intimately tied to their local economies but capable of expansion--to America, perhaps, or more important to Asia and other regions of explosive growth. One such company is Fisher & Paykel, a New Zealand--based maker of appliances that over the course of a dozen years has produced a steady stream of dividends and special distributions and has gained more than 17 percent a year for Jeff.How to find companies like Fisher & Paykel is the heart of this book. You can indeed make the world your oyster by diversifying your portfolio, and Jeff provides indispensable insight and practical guidelines for every aspect of investing directly overseas. He shows how to research and track companies, set up foreign brokerage accounts, handle tax issues, convert currencies, and fund accounts.Why venture beyond the United States to begin with? Because America is really just one small island. For every American public company, there are four beyond our shores--many of which are small to midsize and have huge potential for growth, which you'll never find by trading in America alone.If you're ready to take the next step in building a truly diversified portfolio, you will gain a wealth of invaluable insight and information from Jeff's engaging first-person accounts of his trial-and-error--but, ultimately, highly successful--globe-trotting career in search of worthy stocks. The opportunities for investing overseas are indisputable. The World Is Your Oyster is your travel guide: pinpointing five of the best reasons to go global, detailing various ways for investors of every temperament--from timid to adventurous--to cross financial borders, focusing on how to invest directly in hot spots from China to Turkey to Eastern Europe, and revealing how the Internet and other twenty-first-century technology has opened a world of direct overseas investment opportunities for you.From the Hardcover edition.

The negative relationship between firm and aggregate risk seems to be present across industries in the US, and across OECD countries.  Firm volatility increases after deregulation.  Firm volatility is linked to research and development spending as well as access to external financing.  Further, R&D intensity is also associated with lower correlation of sectoral growth with the rest of the economy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

In foreign exchange markets interbank option pricing conventions make possible reliable inferences about risk-neutral probability distributions with relatively little data.  Moments drawn from risk-neutral exchange rate distribution are used to explore several issues related to the puzzle of excess returns in currency markets.  Tests of the international capital asset pricing model using risk-neutral moments as explanatory variables indicate that option-based moments have considerably greater explanatory power for excess returns in currency markets than has been found in earlier work.  Tests of several hypotheses generated by the peso problem approach indicate that jump risk measured by the risk-neutral coefficient of skewness can explain only a small part of the forward bias.  These tests take into account not only the second, but the third and fourth moments of the exchange rate implied by option prices, and avoid testing a joint hypothesis including a distributional assumption""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site.

Firms that are financially constrained offer an increasing wage profile: They pay lower wages today in exchange of higher wages once they become unconstrained and operate at a larger scale.  In equilibrium, constrained firms are on average smaller and pay lower wages.  In this way the model generates a positive relation between firm size and wages.  Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) we show that the key dynamic properties of the model are supported by the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Real exchange rate volatility and the price of nontradables in sudden-stop-prone economies,"Mendoza, Enrique G.",finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5889673W,/authors/OL1452671A/Mendoza_Enrique_G.,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""The dominant view in the empirical literature on exchange rates is that the high variability of real exchange rates is due to movements in exchange-rate-adjusted prices of tradable goods.  This paper shows that this dominant view does not hold in Mexican data for the periods in which the country had managed exchange rate regimes.  Variance analysis of a 30-year sample of monthly data shows that movements in the price of nontradables relative to tradables account for up to 70 percent of the variability of the real exchange rate during these periods.  The paper proposes a model in which this stylized fact, and the Sudden Stops that accompanied the collapse of Mexico's managed exchange rates, could result from an endogenous amplification mechanism operating via nontradables prices in economies with dollarized liabilities and credit constraints.  The key feature of this mechanism is Irving Fisher's debt-deflation process.  Numerical evaluation suggests that the Fisherian deflation effects on consumption, the current account, and relative prices dwarf those induced by the standard balance sheet effect typical of the Sudden Stops literature""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Studying recently released transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee, we find-- to our surprise-- that Volcker and other FOMC members also regarded long-term interest rates as key indicators of inflation expectations and of their disinflationary policy's credibility.  We also consider the interplay of monetary targets, operating procedures, and credibility during the Volcker disinflation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

This paper studies the case of China for pitfalls of a state-dominated financial system, including possible segmentation of the internal capital market due to local government interference and mis-allocation of capital.  Even without formal legal prohibition to capital movement across regions, we find that capital mobility within China is low.  Furthermore, to the extent some capital moves around the country, the government (as opposed to the private sector) tends to allocate capital systematically away from more productive regions toward less productive ones.  In this context, a smaller role of the government in the financial sector might increase economic efficiency and the rate of economic growth""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Ex ante carrots instead of ex post sticks,Joshua Aizenman,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5889956W,/authors/OL1452712A/Joshua_Aizenman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper argues that the limited ability to help developing countries in a crisis should shift the focus to policies helping in reducing the ex ante probability of crises.  Indirectly, such policies would also alleviate the depths of realized crises.  Two specific ideas are explored: I.  International reserves escrow accounts: Managing international reserves provides an effective mechanism for self insurance.  The hazard of this mechanism is that international reserves are easy prey for opportunistic policy makers in polarized countries characterized by political instability.  This hazard may be alleviated by escrow accounts run by the International Financial Institutions (IFIs), where part of the international reserves of a country are saved and would be used if pre-set conditions, like large TOT deteriorations, are met.  The IFIs may offer a subsidized return on these escrow accounts in order to encourage countries to reduce external borrowing and to increase fiscal savings.  Such subsidies may be welfare improving due to the over borrowing bias induced by sovereign risk.II.  IFIs as lenders of last resort to finance fiscal reforms: I illustrate this possibility in a modified version of Cukierman, Edwards and Tabellinis (AER 1992) model.  I identify conditions where IFIs function as the lenders of last resort, financing fiscal reforms.  IFIs financing may shift the equilibrium from an inefficient outcome with a low tax base and high inflation to a superior outcome, associated with a more sound tax system""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

However, given the sovereign's willingness-to-pay incentive problems, reserve accumulation may reduce sustainable debt levels. In addition, assuming constant debt levels does not allow addressing one of the puzzles behind using reserves as a means to avoid the negative effects of crisis: why do not sovereign countries reduce their sovereign debt instead? To study the joint decision of holding sovereign debt and reserves, we construct a stochastic dynamic equilibrium model calibrated to a sample of emerging markets. We obtain that the reserve accumulation does not play a quantitative important role in this model. In fact, we find the optimal policy is not to hold reserves at all. This finding is robust to considering interest rate shocks, sudden stops, contingent reserves and reserve dependent output costs.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Focusing on the hard-hit Sacramento Valley, Noelle Stout uncovers the predacious bureaucracy that organized the largest bank seizure of residential homes in U.S. history. Stout reveals the failure of Wall Street banks’ mortgage assistance programs—backed by over $300 billion of federal funds—to deliver on the promise of relief.  Unlike the programs of the Great Depression, in which the government took on the toxic mortgage debt of Americans, corporate lenders and loan servicers ultimately denied over 70 percent of homeowner applications. In the voices of bank employees and homeowners, Stout unveils how call center representatives felt about denying appeals and shares the fears of families living on the brink of eviction.  Stout discloses the impacts of rising inequality on homeowners—from whites who felt their middle-class life unraveling to communities of color who experienced a more precipitous and dire decline. Trapped in a Kafkaesque maze of mortgage assistance, borrowers began to view debt refusal as a moral response to lenders, as seemingly mundane bureaucratic dramas came to redefine the meaning of debt and dispossession.

Generalized poisson models and their applications in insurance and finance,Vladimir E.

Please see www.degruyter.com for more information. This volume in the Modern Probability and Statistics series aims to fill the gap in existing literature on compound Cox processes, i.e. sums of independent identically distributed random variables up to a doubly stochastic Poisson process, which are very important, especially for insurance and financial applications where they provide good asymptotic approximations for basic characteristics such as the distributions of the surplus of an insurance company under risk and portfolio fluctuations or of increments of stock prices under non-constant intensity of trade. It presents the present state-of-the-art in the field of compound Cox processes and their applications in insurance and finance. Besides a review of well-known classical results on compound and mixed Poisson processes and risk theory, it contains many new, recently obtained results by the authors. Among these are: new convergence criteria, convergence rate estimates, asymptotic expansions for quantiles of stochastic processes and many others. From the applied problems considered in this book, four deserve to be mentioned especially: 1) modelling the distribution of increments of stock prices, closely connected with prediction of the behaviour of financial indexes; 2) the description of asymptotic behaviour of the so-called generalized risk processes, which take into account both risk and portfolio fluctuations; 3) statistical estimation of the probability of ruin for a generalized risk process; 4) construction of refined approximations to the ruin probability, based on its asymptotic expansions with small safety loading. This book will be of great value to specialists in applied probability and to those who use models and methods of probability theory to solve practical problems in the fields of insurance and finance.

But what is astonishing--and should make us not just afraid but very afraid--are the shenanigans of the biggest banks since the crisis. Bob Ivry passionately, eloquently, and convincingly details the operatic ineptitude of America's best-compensated executives and the ways the government kowtows to what it mistakenly imagines is their competence and success. Ivry shows that the only thing that has changed since the meltdown is how too-big-to-fail banks and their fellow travelers in Washington have nudged us ever closer to an even bigger economic calamity. Informed by deep reporting from New York, Washington, and the heartland, The Seven Sins of Wall Street, like no other book, shows how we're all affected by the financial industry's inhumanity. The transgressions of ""Wall Street titans"" and ""masters of the universe"" are paid for by real people. In fierce, plain English, Ivry indicts a financial industry that continues to work for the few at the expense of the rest of us. Problems that financiers deemed too complicated to be understood by ordinary folks are shown by Ivry to be financial legerdemain-a smokescreen of complexity and jargon that hide the bankers' nefarious activities. The Seven Sins of Wall Street is irreverent and timely, an infuriating black comedy. The Great Depression of the 1930s moved the American political system to real reform that kept the finance industry in check. With millions so deeply affected since the crisis of 2008, you'll finish this book asking yourself how it is that so many of the nation's leading financial institutions remain such exasperating problem children.

It allows for the movement of people and goods to provide the ability to optimize the production and distribution of goods in an effective and efficient manner, and to provide personal opportunities for employment, recreation, education, health care, and other vital activities.   At the same time, the costs to provide, maintain, and operate this complex infrastructure are enormous.  Because so much of the economic resources to be invested come from public funds, it is critical that expenditures are made in a manner that provides society with the best possible return on the investment.  Further, it is important that sufficient investment is made available, and the costs of the investment are equitably borne by taxpayers.   This textbook provides a fundamental overview of the application of engineering economic principles to transportation infrastructure investments.  Basic theory is presented and illustrated with examples specific to the transportation field.  It also reviews the history of transportation finance, as well as current methods for funding transportation investments in the U.S.  Future problems and potential solutions are also discussed and illustrated.

Everyone from Warren Buffett to T. Boone Pickens to George Steinbrenner to Ken Lay has fallen under his microscope.Now, in this collection of his best work, he explores how we define good guys and bad guys in business and concludes that things are often not what they seem.It turns out that there are surprisingly good qualities in classic villains like junk bond king Michael Milken and notorious stock analyst Henry Blodget. And some business celebrities who are widely admired, such as Steve Jobs, are not quite the good guys they appear to be on the surface.Good Guys and Bad Guys also offers a fresh perspective on some of today's biggest controversies, such as global warming, Apple's iPhone, CEO compensation, the tobacco industry, short sellers, and much more.

Social security programs and retirement around the world,Jonathan Gruber,finance,First published in 1997,/works/OL5859972W,/authors/OL1439098A/Jonathan_Gruber,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This is the introduction to and summary of Phase III of an international research project to study the relationship between social security provisions and retirement.  The project relies on the work of a large group of economists in 12 countries who conduct the analysis for each of their countries.  The first phase described the retirement incentives inherent in plan provisions and documented the strong relationship across countries between social security incentives to retire and the proportion of older persons out of the labor force.  The second phase illustrated the large effects that changing plan provisions would have on the labor force participation of older workers.  This third phase shows the consequent fiscal implications that extending labor force participation would have on net program costs -- reduced government social security benefit payments less increased government tax revenues.  The findings are conveyed by simulating the implications of illustrative reforms.  One reform increases benefit eligibility ages by three years.  Another illustrative reform reduces actuarially benefits received before the normal retirement age.  A common reform prescribes the same provisions in each country.  The financial implications of the illustrative reforms are very large in many instances, often as much as 20 to 40 percent of current program costs.  The savings amount to as much a 1 percent or more of country GDP.  The results make clear that reforms like those considered in this volume can have very large fiscal implications for the cost of social security benefits as well as for government revenues engendered by changes in the labor force participation of older workers""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

The false promise of big government,Patrick M. Garry,finance,First published in 2017,/works/OL19718646W,/authors/OL544487A/Patrick_M._Garry,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Intercollegiate Studies Institute|Language English|Pages 103,"""In this bold and brilliant book, Patrick Garry takes on our overgrown government in the terms of its defenders: he systematically demolishes the argument that a larger government better serves the poor and vulnerable. It is simply essential reading."" --Yuval Levin, editor of National Affairs, author of The Fractured Republic and The Great Debate. The debate over the size and scope of the federal government has raged since the New Deal. So why have opponents of big government so rarely made political headway? Because they fail to address the fundamental issue. Patrick M. Garry changes that in this short, powerful book. Garry, a law professor and political commentator, reveals six ways in which big government hurts the very people it purports to help: the poor, the working class, and the middle class. And the problem is worse than that. He shows that big government actually props up the rich, the powerful, and the politically connected. The False Promise of Big Government thus debunks a myth widely accepted in politics today: that only government can help the average person survive and prosper in the contemporary world. Garry demonstrates that opponents of big government rely on arguments that are true but fail to address the heart of the issue. Yes, massive government programs are wasteful and impose huge economic costs on America, and yes, many of them violate constitutional provisions. But in focusing on economic and constitutional arguments, proponents of limited government cede the moral high ground to progressives. The truth is that those who claim to speak for the ""little guy"" actually push for policies that harm the most vulnerable in society. And it is just as true that proponents of limited government don't ignore the working and middle classes but in fact are trying to free those individuals from a government that acts against their interests. In just one hundred pages,The False Promise of Big Governmentlays out everything you need to know about why big government fails and how to overcome it at last""--  ""The book reviews the debate over the size and scope of the federal government, one that has been ongoing since the New Deal right up through the 2016 presidential race. It examines why opponents of big government often fail to make headway. The author argues that there are six ways in which big government hurts the very people it purports to help: the poor, the working class, and the middle class. He also seeks to demonstrate how ""big government"" actually props up the rich, the powerful, and the politically connected. The False Promise of Big Government addresses the myth at the core of modern progressivism: that only government can help the average person survive and prosper in the contemporary world. Garry seeks to demonstrate that opponents of big government rely on arguments that are true but fail to address the heart of the issue: that while massive government programs are wasteful and impose huge economic costs on America, many of them are unconstitutional. In addition, the author argues that those who claim to speak for the ""little guy"" push for policies that harm the most vulnerable in society, while proponents of limited government do not ignore the working and middle classes but in fact are trying to free those individuals from a government that acts against their interests""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The great inflation of the seventies,"Nelson, Edward",finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL5890665W,/authors/OL1452835A/Nelson_Edward,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|Language English,"""This paper revisits the issue of what factors motivated the macroeconomic policies that led to the Great Inflation of the 1970s.  A satisfactory explanation must be consistent with (1) the estimated monetary policy reaction function; (2) the timing patterns relating monetary policy developments and inflation; and (3) the record of economic views (manifested in statements by policymakers and prominent financial commentators).  It is argued that the monetary policy neglect hypothesis--which claims that policymakers took a nonmonetary view of the inflation process--meets all three criteria.  Other explanations are ruled out, with one exception (the output gap mismeasurement hypothesis), which supplements the monetary policy neglect hypothesis.  This conclusion is based on a study of the Great Inflation in both the U.K. and the U.S., and draws on both quantitative and archival evidence, particularly news coverage""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site.

The author, a Buddhist and a financial planner, says yes and explains exactly how. Jonathan DeYoe shows how money drives so many of our decisions. But while we worry about earning it, spending it, and saving it, few of us face it head on. The whole point of Buddhism, he says, is 'to deal with what is, to look it straight in the eye,' and in the context of finances, this means not averting our eyes, deferring to experts, or engaging in get-rich-quick magical thinking. With this in mind, DeYoe shows readers, no matter their income level or spiritual perspective, how to save and invest, pay off debt, and invest for retirement according to their deepest beliefs. The author does all this while emphasizing that money is merely a tool for providing not only material peace of mind but also 'the happiness dividend' we all deserve""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After a brief review of the existing incomplete information literature, the effect of incomplete information on investors' exptected utility, risky asset prices, and interest rates is described. It is demonstrated that increasing the quality of investors' information need not increase their expected utility and the prices of risky assets. The impact of heterogeneous beliefs on investors' portfolio and consumption behavior and equilibrium asset prices is shown to be non-trivial.
