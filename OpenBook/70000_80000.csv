Bove. Now he explains why big banks are the nation's lifeline to success, and why financial disaster will ensue if we make it impossible for them to fill their role in the economy. Bove argues that big banks are necessary to ensure America's position in global finance; to assist corporations in achieving their goals against foreign competition; and, most importantly, to defend the average household's access to financial services. Limiting the major banks, he shows, is an attack on our future growth. Bove offers ways to improve the economy's stability, including allowing some banks to be ""too big to fail"" and lessening the demand on liquidity so they won't need to sell existing loans. His main argument, that we need to stop fighting our greatest guardians of prosperity, is sure to be controversial""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is no longer possible-or even desirable-to learn one set of job skills and to work your way up the ladder. At the same time, entrepreneurs with great ideas for new products or technologies that could change the world often struggle to capture the attention of venture capital firms and incubators; finding the funding necessary to launch a start-up can feel impossible. The business leaders of our future must anticipate change to create their own opportunities for personal satisfaction and professional success. In Disrupt You!, Jay Samit, a digital media expert who has launched, grown, and sold start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike, describes the unique method he has used to invent new markets and expand established businesses. Samit has been at the helm of businesses in the ecommerce, digital video, social media, mobile communications, and software industries, helping to navigate them through turbulent economic times and guide them through necessary transformation so that they stay ahead of the curve. In Disrupt You!, he reveals how specific strategies that help companies flourish can be applied at an individual level to help anyone can achieve success and lasting prosperity-without needing to raise funds from outside investors. Incorporating stories from his own experience and anecdotes from other innovators and disruptive businesses-including Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, YouTube, Circ du Soleil, Odor Eaters, Iams, Silly Putty, and many more-Samit shows how personal transformation can reap entrepreneurial and professional rewards. Disrupt You! offers clear and empowering advice for anyone looking to break through; for anyone with a big idea but with no idea how to apply it; and for anyone worried about being made irrelevant in an era of technological transformation. This engaging, perspective-shifting book demystifies the mechanics of disruption for individuals and businesses alike""--  ""According to USA Today, fifty percent of today's college students want to be an entrepreneur. And the jobless recovery of our recent recession and the realities of our always-changing world mean that everyone now needs to think like an innovator. Small startups are displacing hundred-year-old companies virtually overnight. The business landscape is more volatile--and full of possibility--than ever. A serial entrepreneur who has been at the forefront of global trends for over thirty years, Jay Samit spent his career studying the system successful disruptors employ to achieve greatness. In Disrupt Yourself, he distills that process into steps that can be practiced by anyone. Virgin, Apple, Microsoft, and eBay were all founded by disruptors who questioned their assumptions, designed their own life paths, found ideas that solved big problems, and then pivoted their energies to do it all over again. Samit shows how he made a career launching businesses, selling them, and then reinventing himself to do it again and in Disrupt Yourself, he shows how others can do it too. With the practical insight of Marshall Goldsmith and the no-holds-barred style of Tim Ferriss, digital innovator Jay Samit shows how all successful entrepreneurs and business leaders maximize opportunity, drive change, and achieve resilience. This groundbreaking book is an essential guide for those yearning for professional success in an unstable world""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Managers across the world are beating a path to India because it is the global leader for offshore IT-enabled services. Many corporate leaders seek to reduce their costs. Many seek to improve service quality, but not many understand India on their first visit and some are confused by clashes of culture. This book aims to introduce India, the major players in the Indian service industry, the reasons why you should utilise India as an offshore outsourcing destination and the steps you need to take to find and work with a local partner. This book advises you on who is important, where they are and what they are doing in India. It will help you to avoid cultural clashes and smooth over the traumatic transition period once you decide outsourcing to India is the right strategic decision for your company. ""In Outsourcing to India: The Offshore Advantage, Mark Kobayashi-Hillary has offered a balanced view on the trend to outsource to India. He makes a compelling economic case for outsourcing to this region while acknowledging and discussing the emotive aspects of such a decision."" Kiran Karnik, President of NASSCOM.

Democracy reinvented,Hollie Russon Gilman,business__economics,First published in 2016,/works/OL20022094W,/authors/OL7606243A/Hollie_Russon_Gilman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 202,"""Participatory Budgeting-the experiment in democracy that could redefine how public budgets are decided in the United States. Democracy Reinvented is the first comprehensive academic treatment of participatory budgeting in the United States, situating it within a broader trend of civic technology and innovation. This global phenomenon, which has been called ""revolutionary civics in action"" by the New York Times, started in Brazil in 1989 but came to America only in 2009. Participatory budgeting empowers citizens to identify community needs, work with elected officials to craft budget proposals, and vote on how to spend public funds. Democracy Reinvented places participatory budgeting within the larger discussion of the health of U.S. democracy and focuses on the enabling political and institutional conditions. Author and former White House policy adviser Hollie Russon Gilman presents theoretical insights, indepth case studies, and interviews to offer a compelling alternative to the current citizen disaffection and mistrust of government. She offers policy recommendations on how to tap online tools and other technological and civic innovations to promote more inclusive governance. While most literature tends to focus on institutional changes without solutions, this book suggests practical ways to empower citizens to become change agents. Democracy Reinvented also includes a discussion on the challenges and opportunities that come with using digital tools to re-engage citizens in governance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This study provides a comprehensive picture of uneven growth and development within regions in India. Inclusive growth, broadly defined as rapid growth benefiting every section of society, has been the main strategy pursued by the present government of India. While the existing literature on inclusive growth tends to examine the trend and extent of economic inequality over years, or discusses inclusive growth in a wide range of social and economic areas, this book, building on the findings of Inclusiveness in India: A Strategy for Growth and Equality, critically examines inclusive growth and development by paying particular attention to widening disparities between regions, and social and economic stratifications. A team of renowned scholars bring together a wealth of research to illustrates the important aspects of underdevelopment and the process by which the underclass has been left behind through focusing on the country's most neglected regions. Based on original surveys and fieldwork, individual chapters focus on critical issues such as; agricultural underdevelopment; economic growth and increasing intrastate disparity; the process and impact of migration, both at place of origin and destination; and administrative constraints to the implementation of pro-poor policies. In so doing, the book suggests how inclusive growth aimed at distributing the benefits of development to disadvantaged sections of society can be achieved""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Learning leadership in a changing world,Mark McCloskey,business__economics,First published in 2014,/works/OL23195897W,/authors/OL1124987A/Mark_McCloskey,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English|Pages 281,"""In the second decade of the 21st century, it is increasingly apparent that personality power and technical-managerial competence are no longer the primary qualifiers for developing effective leadership. Learning Leadership in a Changing World provides direction and support in the form of the 4R Model of Leadership--a theoretically sound, conceptually straightforward, and educationally powerful framework.  The framework and content of the 4R Model replaces the charisma and competence images of leadership effectiveness with a fresh vision of 'good leadership' as virtue-based influence, and provides a developmental framework to put this new perspective into practice.With over a decade of experience developing transformative leadership graduate programs, Dr. McCloskey offers the blueprint for scholars to think with conceptual clarity about 21st century leadership effectiveness. McCloskey introduces the 'New Normal,' the social, economic, and cultural change which has created a fundamentally new leadership landscape of disruptive threats and discontinuous change. This narrative is replacing images of success grounded in charisma and managerial competence with an ancient configuration of personal assets, 'virtue-driven influence.' McCloskey looks to discount developmental fatalism of the Old Normal and argues that leadership effectiveness is available to many, and not merely a few. Learning Leadership in a Changing World provides the theoretical, educational, and developmental framework to help professors, scholars, and graduate students understand modern leadership in light of 21st century challenges and opportunities. ""--  ""What makes for an effective twenty-first century leader? A popular consensus has emerged around two primary qualifiers--charisma and technical-managerial competence. It is, however, increasingly evident these assets are diminishing in value. Learning Leadership in a Changing World provides an alternative vision of effective leadership in the form of the 4R Model, which replaces the charisma and competence images of leadership effectiveness with a fresh vision of ""good leadership"" as virtue-based influence""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Rhine valley is such a region comprising the cities and areas along the Rhine river and its tributaries. The transition from coal to oil that unfolded between 1945 and 1973 rapidly transformed the region, shattering some of the old river-based connections and creating new ones with the introduction of large-scale cross-border oil pipelines. Multinational enterprises shaped these new regional connections but divergent national government responses gave rise to differentiated development in different parts of the Rhine valley.?Multinational Enterprise and Transnational Regions argues that processes of regional change should be understood from transnational interconnections rather than from local or national perspectives. This book uses a transnational business history methodology to tease out the region's transformation and to circumvent the national bias in public sources. It will be of relevance to academics and researchers with an interest in regional and transnational European history, international business, environmental history, and business history, as well as practitioners interested in the oil industry, energy and energy history, business history and international business, and associated disciplines.""--Provided by publisher.

But for business, marketing, and political campaigns, there is no definitive how-to on crafting a compelling narrative that achieves lasting results. And without a narrative, no amount of framing, complex messaging, or facts will succeed.  On Message solves that problem, illustrating how effective communicators understand the power of narrative, emotion, and simple messaging, and posits that having a personal, emotional narrative is the basis for all successful communication.  Drawing on Zach Friend's own experience and insights from politics, advertising, corporate communications, entertainment, and social psychology, On Message provides a simple process for applying the powerful principles behind crafting a narrative, ultimately paving the path to success. Specifically, readers will:  -Learn how to focus their communication efforts in a dramatically more powerful way on the most important factor, narrative; -Master the mindset needed to become a better communicator and make a forceful impact on their audience and clients; -Stop wasting time and energy gathering unnecessary facts and data that don't advance their message; and -Get results faster by using narrative as a productive tool that will fuel success""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The term 'poetics' refers to a wider definition aligned with a philosophical perspective, in which poetics emerges as a phenomenal aspect of being. This book is a commentary on poetic elements in organization that are critical to developmental areas of organizations, yet poetics is rarely given the attention it deserves. However elusive the poetic element is, it still manages to flow through organizational spaces in material and nonmaterial ways. Although many studies have been done on poetics from a number of different angles, very few studies specifically focus on the implicit aspects and how these take place. This book provides academics, students and researchers with a poetic perspective on academic research, which can revitalize studies in the field. The reader is taken on a poetic journey in which organizational members and practices are viewed in a new light""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Since his release from federal prison, in 1998, Mitnick has turned his life around and established himself as one of the most sought-after computer security experts worldwide. Now, in The Art of Deception, the world's most notorious hacker gives new meaning to the old adage, ""It takes a thief to catch a thief.""  Focusing on the human factors involved with information security, Mitnick explains why all the firewalls and encryption protocols in the world will never be enough to stop a savvy grifter intent on rifling a corporate database or an irate employee determined to crash a system. With the help of many fascinating true stories of successful attacks on business and government, he illustrates just how susceptible even the most locked-down information systems are to a slick con artist impersonating an IRS agent. Narrating from the points of view of both the attacker and the victims, he explains why each attack was so successful and how it could have been prevented in an engaging and highly readable style reminiscent of a true-crime novel.

Well-nigh unfathomable problems lead to measures that seem like emergency operations on the open heart of the Western world, performed with no knowledge of the patient's clinical history. The gravity of the situation is matched by the paucity of our understanding of it, and of how it came about in the first place.  In this book, compiled from his Adorno Lectures given in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Streeck lays bare the roots of the present financial, fiscal and economic crisis, seeing it as part of the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s. Linking up with the crisis theories of that decade, he analyses the subsequent tensions and conflicts involving states, governments, voters and capitalist interests--a process in which the defining focus of the European state system has shifted from taxation through debt to budgetary ""consolidation."" The book then ends by exploring the prospects for a restoration of social and economic stability. Buying Time is a model of enlightenment. It shows that something deeply disturbing underlies the current situation: a metamorphosis of the whole relationship between democracy and capitalism""--  ""The financial and economic crisis that began in 2008 still has the world on tenterhooks. The gravity of the situation is matched by a general paucity of understanding about what is happening and how it started. In this book, based on his 2012 Adorno Lectures given in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Streeck places the crisis in the context of the long neoliberal transformation of postwar capitalism that began in the 1970s. He analyses the subsequent tensions and conflicts involving states, governments, voters and capitalist interests, as expressed in inflation, public debt, and rising private indebtedness. Streeck traces the transformation of the tax state into a debt state, and from there into the consolidation state of today. At the centre of the analysis is the changing relationship between capitalism and democracy, in Europe and elsewhere, and the advancing immunization of the former against the latter""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Providing full historical context and drawing on a wide range of literature, this book explores the continuous economic and social transformation of the post-socialist world. While the future is yet to be determined, understanding the present phase of transformation is critical. The book's core exploration evolves along three pivots of competitive economic structure, institutional change, and social welfare. The main elements include analysis of the emergence of the socialist economic model; its adaptations through the twentieth century; discussion of the 1990s market transition reforms; post-2008 crisis development; and the social and economic diversity in the region today. With an appreciation for country specifics, the book also considers the urgent problems of social policy, poverty, income inequality, and labor migration. Transition Economies will aid students, researchers and policy makers working on the problems of comparative economics, economic development, economic history, economic systems transition, international political economy, as well as specialists in post-Soviet and Central and Eastern European regional studies. --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Get in Gear positively affects the relational dynamics of those around us is through the use of powerful metaphor, relevant language, and actionable tools via 5 Gears. Everyone who reads it will come away speaking a new language, one that helps them connect deeper and more genuinely with anyone in any setting. And with these deeper connections comes deeper relationships and greater influence. Practical goodness and needed insight will change your world - at least in your family or team or just maybe within yourself! The 5 Gears: First gear represents full recharge, while second gear represents recharging or connecting with family or friends without the involvement of work. Third gear is our social gear, while fourth gear is our work gear that allows us to work hard while also multi-tasking. Fifth Gear is our full task mode that allows us to ""get in the zone"" without interruption. Each gear has its own purpose and place. Once you learn to use the gears consistently with those in your life, you will notice the common language that begins to form, enabling objectivity to characterize your conversation instead of the subjective judgment or condescension that becomes pervasive when each person is speaking a different ""language.""""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The time to remake the world has become shorter with every new technological revolution. The Industrial Revolution took almost two centuries to reshape the world, the electronics revolution around 70 years, the information revolution two decades, and innovations in biotechnology and nanotechnology to reshape the world could be just a matter of less than a decade. The projected impact of nanotechnology has been touted as a second industrial revolution--not the third, fourth, or fifth, because despite similar predictions for technologies such as computers and robotics, nothing has yet eclipsed the first. Society is at the threshold of a revolution that will transform the ways in which materials and products are created. How will this revolution develop? The opportunities that will develop in the future will depend significantly upon the ways in which a number of challenges are met. As we design systems on a nanoscale, we develop the capability to redesign the structure of all materials--natural and synthetic--along with rethinking the new possibilities of the reconstruction of any and all materials. Such a change in our design power presents tremendous social and ethical questions. To enable our future leadership to make decisions for sustainable ethical, economic nanotechnological development, it is imperative that we educate all nanotechnology stakeholders about the short-term and long-term benefits, limitations, and risks of nanotechnology. The social implications of nanotechnology encompass many fundamental areas such as ethics, privacy, environment, and security""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Blockbuster Video. Jiffy Lube. Subway. Franchising has become an ever-present feature of the American landscape. One-third of the U.S. gross domestic product flows through franchises, and one out of every sixteen workers is employed by one. But how did franchising come to play such a dominant role in the American economy? What are the day-to-day experiences of franchisees and franchisers in the workplace? What challenges and pitfalls await them as they stake their claim to prosperity? These are just a few of the questions explored in Franchising Dreams, a documentary-like look into the frustrations and uncertainties that entrepreneurs face in their pursuit of the American dream. Peter M. Birkeland worked for three years in the front-line operations of franchise units for three companies, met with CEOs and executives, and attended countless trade shows, seminars, and expositions. All this firsthand experience gave him unprecedented access to the hopes and aspirations of franchisees. His book closely traces different franchisees and follows them as their dreams of wealth and independence buckle beneath the weight of frustrating logistics and contractual technicalities. Through extensive interviews and research, Birkeland not only discovers what makes franchisees succeed or fail, he uncovers the difficulties in running a business according to someone else's system and values. Bearing witness to a market flooded with fierce competitors and dependent on the inscrutable whims of consumers, he uncovers the numerous challenges that franchisees face in making their businesses succeed.

These deficits were serviced by a massive influx of capital inflows, made possible by the gradual removal of or reduction in restrictions on foreign investments since 1991. However, things changed with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. While a growth slowdown coupled with a deterioration of the current account balance was expected during the global financial crisis, the extent of the negative spillovers to India was striking nonetheless. Though offering many growth-enhancing opportunities, India's ever increasing integration with the world economy has given rise to a host of new challenges in managing the economy, particularly given the absence of any type of global policy coordination. This book sets out to provide an empirical assessment of some of India's crucial policy challenges pertaining to its monetary and external sector management""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Starting with a handful of software contractors who produced specialized programs for the few existing machines, the industry grew to include producers of corporate software packages and then makers of mass-market products and recreational software. This book tells the story of each of these types of firm, focusing on the products they developed, the business models they followed, and the markets they served.  By describing the breadth of this industry, Martin Campbell-Kelly corrects the popular misconception that one firm is at the center of the software universe. He also tells the story of lucrative software products such as IBM's CICS and SAP's R/3, which, though little known to the general public, lie at the heart of today's information infrastructure.  With its wealth of industry data and its thoughtful judgments, this book will become a starting point for all future investigations of this fundamental component of computer history.

Yet many lack self-knowledge, failing to recognize the limitations that accompany their strengths. They drive forward too boldly, unwittingly creating the potential for one slip or bump along the way to diminish their work and the respect of those they lead. That lack of self-knowledge may threaten a once-promising career. Intentional leaders, however, learn to focus not only on what they plan to accomplish, but how they will lead others to get there. They examine their strengths and identify their weaknesses, and. In this process, they become the kind of leaders employees want to follow. First though, they need to understand how to reach that point. In Intentional Leadership: 12 Lenses for Focusing Strengths, Managing Weaknesses, and Achieving Your Purpose, Jane A. G. Kise introduces the 12 Lenses for Leadership-a framework developed from extensive research on personality type and emotional intelligence that offers a meta-analysis of the essential tasks and attitudes of successful leaders. Through these lenses, you will learn: How personality type informs decision making How to identify and then compare your strengths and values to good leadership practice How to identify your potential weaknesses and blind spots How to use your strengths and weaknesses to optimize your leadership style With a provocative analysis and yet clear guidance,simple framework, Intentional Leadership helps you align your purpose and actions to achieve your true potential as a leader""--  ""In Intentional Leadership: 12 Lenses for Focusing Strengths, Managing Weaknesses, and Achieving Your Purpose, Jane A.

He becomes a real value investor. In this fascinating inside story, Guy Spier details his career from Harvard MBA to hedge fund manager. But the path was not so straightforward. Spier reveals his transformation from a Gordon Gekko wannabe, driven by greed, to a sophisticated investor who enjoys success without selling his soul to the highest bidder. Spier's journey is similar to the thousands that flock to Wall Street every year with their shiny new diplomas, aiming to be King of Wall Street. Yet what Guy realized just in the nick of time was that the King really lived 1,500 miles away in Omaha, Nebraska. Spier determinedly set out to create a new career in his own way. Along the way he learned some powerful lessons which include: why the right mentors and partners are critical to long term success on Wall Street; why a topnotch education can sometimes get in the way of your success; that real learning doesn't begin until you are on your own; and how the best lessons from Warren Buffett have less to do with investing and more to do with being true to yourself. Spier also reveals some of his own winning investment strategies, detailing deals that were winners but also what he learned from deals that went south. Part memoir, part Wall Street advice, and part how-to, Guy Spier takes readers on a ride through Wall Street but more importantly provides those that want to take a different path with the insight, guidance, and inspiration they need to carve out their own definition of success""--   Read more Read less",53 Want to read|4 Currently reading|1 Have read

Global supply chain management shares some of the main concerns of traditional supply chain management, such as lowering the costs of procurement and decreasing the risks related to purchasing activities. It also has the additional challenge of involving a company's worldwide interests and suppliers, covering numerous organizations across several countries, borders, time zones, cultures, and languages. Global Supply Chain Ecosystems explores the latest market trends and industry developments across emerging, developing, and developed markets. Author Mark Millar presents practical insights that will help companies capitalize on market opportunities, overcome supply chain challenges, and make better informed business decisions. In addition to highlighting key supply chain shifts such as the move beyond globalization back towards regionalization, the book explains several critical aspects of global supply chain ecosystems, including visibility, risk, resilience, sustainability, and collaboration""--  ""Twenty-first-century supply chains have evolved into world-wide inter-connected supply-and-demand networks comprising vastly more complex operations, with profound inter-dependencies and exposure to greater volatility in our uncertain world. The linear concept of a chain is therefore no longer adequate to describe these complex international networks of suppliers, stakeholders, partners, regulators and customers that are involved in ensuring the efficient and effective movement of products, services, information and funds around the world - we are firmly in the era of Global Supply Chain Ecosystems. Exploring the latest market trends and industry developments across emerging, developing and developed markets, in Global Supply Chain Ecosystems industry leader Mark Millar presents detailed and practical insights that will help you capitalise on market opportunities, overcome supply chain challenges and make better informed business decisions.

Business Cycles: Part II,Friedrich A. von Hayek,business__economics,First published in 2012,/works/OL20701982W,/authors/OL117843A/Friedrich_A._von_Hayek,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27992572M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 350,"In the years following its publication, F. A. Hayek's pioneering work on business cycles was regarded as an important challenge to what was later known as Keynesian macroeconomics. Today, as debates rage on over the monetary origins of the current economic and financial crisis, economists are once again paying heed to Hayek's thoughts on the repercussions of excessive central bank interventions.  The latest editions in Routledge's ongoing series The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, these volumes bring together Hayek's work on what causes periods of boom and bust in the economy. Moving away from the classical emphasis on equilibrium, Hayek demonstrates that business cycles are generated by the adaptation of the structure of production to changes in relative demand. Thus, when central banks artificially lower interest rates, the result is a misallocation of capital and the creation of asset bubbles and additional instability. Business Cycles: Part I contains Hayek's two major monographs on the topic: Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle and Prices and Production. Reproducing the text of the original 1933 translation of the former, this edition also draws on the original German, as well as more recent translations. For Prices and Production, a variorum edition is presented, incorporating the 1931 first edition and its 1935 revision. Business Cycles: Part II assembles a series of Hayek's shorter papers on the topic, ranging from the 1920s to 1981.  In addition to bringing together Hayek's work on the evolution of business cycles, the two volumes of Business Cycles also include extensive introductions by Hansjoerg Klausinger, placing the writings in intellectual context, including their reception and the theoretical debates to which they contributed, and providing background on the evolution of Hayek's thought.

The knockoff economy,Kal Raustiala,business__economics,First published in 2012,/works/OL16521910W?edition=ia%3Aknockoffeconomyh0000raus,/authors/OL4863422A/Kal_Raustiala,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25215123M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Oxford University Press, USA,              Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 272","""Conventional wisdom holds that intellectual property rights are essential for innovation. But are copyright and patents really necessary to spark creativity? In The Knockoff Economy, Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman provocatively argue that creativity can not only survive in the face of copying, but can thrive.  The Knockoff Economy approaches the question of incentives and innovation in a wholly new way--by exploring creative fields that do not rely on legal monopolies, such as fashion, cuisine, and even professional football. By uncovering these important but rarely studied creative worlds, Raustiala and Sprigman reveal a nuanced and fascinating relationship between imitation and innovation. In some creative fields copying is kept in check through informal industry norms enforced by private sanctions. In other cases, the freedom to copy actually promotes creativity. High fashion gave rise to the very term ""knockoff,"" yet imitation only makes the fashion cycle run faster--and forces the fashion industry to be ever more creative.  Raustiala and Sprigman carry their analysis from food to font design to football plays to finance, examining how and why each of these vibrant fields remains innovative, even in the face of sometimes-extensive imitation. There is an important thread that ties all these instances together--successful creative industries can evolve to be resistant to, and even to profit from, piracy.  And there are important lessons here for copyright-focused industries, like music and film, that have struggled with piracy.  Raustiala and Sprigman's arguments have been making headlines in The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Financial Times, the Boston Globe, Le Monde, and elsewhere. By looking where few had looked before--at industries that fall outside normal IP law--The Knockoff Economy opens up fascinating creative worlds. And it demonstrates that not only is a great deal of innovation possible without IP, but that IP's absence is sometimes better for innovation""--  ""In many sectors, copying is more or less accepted as a business strategy. Products that look, taste, and sound suspiciously like 'originals' abound in upscale chain restaurants, fashion outlets, and contemporary architecture. And such industries typically regard the pervasive piracy as a spur toward further innovation (albeit individual designers and creators may condemn it). When an original becomes a knockoff, it's a signal to move on to the next big thing. Interestingly, while piracy certainly skirts legality, there is no prosecution of it in many arenas. Instead, sectors as diverse as the jam band circuit, the gourmet scene in New York and Los Angeles, the comedy circuit, the garment industry, and the NFL accept the fact that copying will occur and instead rely on social norms to police the practice. Those who step out of bounds are called on it, and often ostracized. As Kal Raustiala and Chris Sprigman argue in The Piracy Paradox, such fields have not suffered any loss of vibrancy. There is presently an intense debate surrounding copyright law, especially with regard to how it applies to the media and entertainment industries, yet very rarely does it factor in the benefits of piracy that are so evident in other sectors. This is to their detriment, the authors argue. Enhancing copyright law has not worked, largely because people subjected to it do not accept the social norms that the law implies. Changing norms so that consumers and producers buy into limits on acceptable practice offers a path out of the dilemma. That means acknowledging the dynamism that an acceptable level of piracy fosters, and in turn rejecting aggressive approaches to copyright law enforcement""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why they do it,Eugene Soltes,business__economics,First published in 2016,/works/OL20042720W?edition=ia%3Awhytheydoitinsid0000solt,/authors/OL7611588A/Eugene_Soltes,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27222752M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  PublicAffairs|Language English|Pages 448,"""Rarely does a week go by without a well-known executive being indicted for engaging in a white-collar crime. Perplexed as to what drives successful, wealthy people to risk it all, Harvard Business School professor Eugene Soltes took a remarkable journey deep into the minds of these white-collar criminals, spending seven years in the company of the men behind the largest corporate crimes in history-from the financial fraudsters of Enron, to the embezzlers at Tyco, to the Ponzi schemers Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford. Drawing on intimate details from personal visits, letters, and phone calls with these former executives, as well as psychological, sociological, and historical research, Why They Do It is a breakthrough look at the dark side of the business world. Soltes refutes popular but simplistic explanations of why seemingly successful executives engage in crime. White-collar criminals, he shows, are not merely driven by excessive greed or hubris, nor do they usually carefully calculate the costs and benefits before breaking the law and see it's worth the risk. Instead, he shows that most of these executives make decisions the way we all do-on the basis of their intuitions and gut feelings. The trouble is, these gut feelings are often poorly suited for the modern business world. Based on extensive interaction with nearly fifty former executives-many of whom have never spoken about their crimes-Soltes provides insights into why some saw the immediate effects of misconduct as positive, why executives often don't feel the emotions (angst, guilt, shame) most people would expect, and how acceptable norms in the business community can differ from those of the broader society""--  ""Perplexed as to why people who seemingly had it all would risk it all just to acquire more, Eugene Soltes began an investigation into the mind of the corporate criminal. His journey into this netherworld included intense and lengthy personal interactions with the famous (such as Bernie Madoff, executives from Enron, Worldcom, Tyco, and McKinsey) as well as those who are lesser known--all of whom traded places of privilege for prison and disgrace. Based on intimate details from personal visits, interviews, letters and phone calls and fascinating psychological, sociological and historical insight, Why They Do It is a breakthrough look at a modern phenomenon. Soltes pushes beyond the explanation that these criminals were driven by psychological aberration, overconfidence, or excessive greed and ambition. Nor did they rationally calculate the costs and benefits of their crimes. Instead, these people were working in a ""grey zone""--stepping over the line, often without careful calculation, letting their intuition and gut feel for what is right and wrong elude them. Based on innovative research and extended contact with close to 50 former executives--many of whom have never spoken about their crimes--Soltes provides insights such as why some saw the immediate effects of misconduct as positive; why executives often don't feel the emotions--angst, guilt, shame--most people would expect; and how acceptable norms in the business community can differ from those of the broader society. No one book has provided a complete picture of this phenomenon of the white-collar criminal.

A History of Indian Economic Thought provides the first overview of economic thought in the sub-continent. Arguing that it would be inappropriate to rely on formal economic analyses it draws on a wide range of sources; epics, religious and moral texts for the early period and public speeches, addresses, and newspaper articles for controversies from the nineteenth century onwards.

In a world of brand names, many of us judge ourselves and others by the products we own. Teenagers broadcast their brand allegiances over social media. Tourists flock to Rodeo Drive to have their pictures taken in front of luxury stores. Soccer moms switch from minivans to SUVs to hybrids, while hip beer connoisseurs flaunt their knack for distinguishing a Kölsch from a pilsner. How did this pervasive desire for ""cool"" emerge, and why is it so powerful today that it is a prime driver of the global economy? In Cool, the neuroscientist and philosopher Steven Quartz and the political scientist Anette Asp bring together the latest findings in brain science, economics, and evolutionary biology to form a provocative theory of consumerism, revealing how the brain's ""social calculator"" and an instinct to rebel are the crucial missing links in understanding the motivations behind our spending habits. Applying their theory to everything from grocery shopping to the near-religious devotion of Harley-Davidson fans, Quartz and Asp explore how the brain's ancient decision-making machinery guides consumer choice. Using these revolutionary insights, they show how we use products to advertise ourselves to others in an often unconscious pursuit of social esteem. Surprising at every turn, Cool will change the way you think about money, status, desire, and choice""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Particularly those consumers who feel strongly about the environment often treat buying green as an ethical and moral imperative. Empowered, informed, and willing to make a political point with their dollars, these consumers are calling the shots. Brands need to pay attention and learn to market to them. Ethical Marketing and the New Consumer explores and explains the various types of consumers and mindsets and presents techniques and channels to the ethical consumer market. The author identifies 50 ethical values that matter to consumers and uses case studies to show how great brands are winning over ethical consumers--or losing them.  Chris Arnold (London, UK) is founder and Creative Partner at FEEL, the UK's leading specialist agency in the art of ethical marketing.

For the most part these agreements failed to deliver the regional integration and economic benefits that were promised, and amounted to little more than a propaganda coup for the leaders that signed them. This book explores conventional explanations of the failure of these agreements, and challenges the accepted wisdom, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between ""Big Man"" politics and crony capitalism.  The rise of second generation regional trade agreements in the first decade of the twenty-first century emphasises the pressing need for a revised assessment of the aims, consequences and scope of these agreements. This book focuses on the revitalized East African Community to examine the potential benefits of modern agreements to foster economic development and the hurdles that must be overcome to realize this potential""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It affects lives and livelihoods, infrastructure and institutions, as well as beliefs, cultures and identities. There is a growing recognition that the social dimensions of vulnerability and adaptation now need to move to the forefront of development policies and practices. This book presents case studies showing that climate change is as much a problem of development as for development, with many of the risks closely linked to past, present and future development pathways. Development policies and practices can play a key role in addressing climate change, but it is critical to question to what extent such actions and interventions reproduce, rather than address, the social and political structures and development pathways driving vulnerability. The chapters emphasise that adaptation is about much more than a set of projects or interventions to reduce specific impacts of climate change; it is about living with change while also transforming the processes that contribute to vulnerability in the first place. This book will help students in the field of climate change and development to make sense of adaptation as a social process, and it will provide practitioners, policymakers and researchers working at the interface between climate change and development with useful insights for approaching adaptation as part of a larger transformation to sustainability.

It includes solutions for the challenges of continuing to work and earn money abroad, too.As long-time contributors to the acknowledged leader in the field, International Living, authors Suzan Haskins and Dan Precher have at their disposal more than thirty years of International Living experience and expertise in the topic. They've been writing about living overseas for more than 12 years and have created their own broad and deep body of work, including regular blogs on the topic for Huffington Post and AARP. The authors include information and strategies that can be successfully applied by anyone regardless of their political or economic opinions. For anyone who wants a happier, healthier, more affordable life, The International Living Guide to Retiring Overseas on a Budget shows you how to enjoy the romance and excitement of living abroad on an affordable budget""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book provides the salient characteristics of successful companies, leaders and business practices of the 21st century. It covers business in Europe, North America and the Asia/Pacific region. Dozens of companies are profiled - Nestle, 3M, Toyota, Royal Dutch Shell, Procter & Gamble, Sony - and many more. This is must-reading for executives, managers, investors, students and others who want to plot a successful course for the future.

In the early modern period, however, there was no common perception of the economy, and discourses on money, trade, and commerce treated economic phenomena as properties of physical nature. Only in the early nineteenth century did economists begin to posit and identify the economy as a distinct object, divorcing it from natural processes and attaching it exclusively to human laws and agency.In The Natural Origins of Economics, Margaret Schabas traces the emergence and transformation of economics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from a natural to a social science. Focusing on the works of several prominent economists—David Hume, Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill—Schabas examines their conceptual debt to natural science and thus locates the evolution of economic ideas within the history of science. An ambitious study, The Natural Origins of Economics will be of interest to economists, historians, and philosophers alike.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But it owes its existence to the visionary genius and dogged tenacity of one man—John C. Bogle, one of the last of a breed of principled and unbending financial legends.Over the years, Bogle’s prescient and fiery speeches to the burgeoning Vanguard staff have also become legend. Character Counts collects those speeches in one volume. More than just an insider’s portrait of the reasons behind Vanguard’s remarkable success, however, it is a fascinating oral history of the too-long-in-coming empowerment of America’s independent investor—and the take-no-prisoners attitude of the man who dedicated his life to making it happen.

Based on his popular column in Forbes, Clash details his own exotic adventures and includes anecdotes from high-profile, daredevil executives who share his passion for adventure-from flying to the edge of space 84,000 feet up (Dennis Tito, Chief Executive of Wilshire Associates), to climbing 20,000-foot mountain peaks (Timothy Forbes, Chief Operating Officer of Forbes, Inc.), to racing open-wheel cars (Mark Patterson, Vice Chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston), to swimming at the North Pole (Geoffrey Kent, Chief Executive of Abercrombie & Kent). Clash's dramatic narrative also explores the powerful connection between extreme success in business and in life, and covers topics such as risk-taking, testing personal limits, and dealing with decision-making responsibilities.   James M. Clash (New York, NY) covers mutual funds for Forbes magazine and writes a popular column called ""The Adventurer"" for Forbes Global. An avid wilderness enthusiast, he is a Fellow in the Explorers Club who has undertaken a number of unforgettable challenges-he has climbed the Matterhorn, ridden in a MiG jet fighter at two-and-a-half-times the speed of sound, driven Indy cars at upwards of 180 mph, climbed virgin mountains in Antarctica, and has visited the North Pole twice. Clash has also interviewed legendary adventurers such as Buzz Aldrin, Sir Roger Bannister, Sir Edmund Hillary, and four-time Indy 500 winner Rick Mears-all of whom are included in this book.

Award-winning author, researcher, and analyst Farai Chideya offers a practical guide to the ways in which work in America is changing and how you can navigate today's volatile job market. Since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, America's work landscape has changed dramatically. Many people experienced long-term unemployment that eroded their savings, and the globalized economy means that not just jobs but entire career tracks are created and destroyed in front of our eyes. We're living in an age of rapid disruption where we can barely adjust to one new reality before a new new reality comes along. So how are we supposed to live a rewarding life--working fulfilling, stable jobs that also cover our monthly expenses--in such a chaotic economy? In The Episodic Career, Farai Chideya explores the landscape of employment in America. Profiling the rich, the poor, and people from every strata in between, Chideya seeks to understand the many kinds of work we do--for example, not just job fields, but whether we seek to build institutions or seek social change while earning money. In addition, Chideya provides a self-diagnostic tool to help you find your work/life ""sweet spot."" You'll see how different types of people have navigated their careers and forged their own paths even in times of hardship. As a young reporter at Newsweek, CNN, and ABC, Chideya realized that her working-class Baltimore childhood and factors like Ivy League education affected how people viewed her, and she takes a frank look at stereotypes, employment discrimination, and how to create healthy workplaces. Ultimately, she asks how we as a country can sustain the American Dream. Knowledge of the workplace is power over your career.

This new theory is based on careful analysis of actual growth; it covers the causes and mechanisms as well as the results of growth. This new theory extends conventional theory by operating at the industry level and by placing demand considerations at the forefront of growth. Demand growth - based on product innovation, marketing, credit and the consumer society - drives the economy forward while supply growth - based on investment and process innovation - sustains the growth in spending and incomes. Growth is not automatic but, in the right conditions, demand and supply expansion work together to generate sustained growth. Economic Growth offers a new view of growth, unique in its combination of historical depth, intellectual clarity and practical relevance. Its original insights will interest academic and professional economists, while its comprehensive treatment and lucid explanations make it an excellent guidebook for anyone interested in economic growth. -- cover.

These collaborations are some of the most complex and exciting in the business world.  And while CBAs offer multinational companies a way into the global marketplace, there is no guarantee of success.Managing Human Resources in Cross-Border Alliances looks at the business and human resources issues that arise in these complex collaborations, putting forward the case that it is the handling of these issues that can determine the CBA's success.  The book takes readers through the two main kinds of CBA, international joint ventures (IJV) and international mergers and acquisitions (IMA), explaining how each type works and which Human Resources (HR) issues arise.  As well as analysing these issues and explaining the relevant management, economics and sociological theories, it uses short end-of-chapter case studies and indepth end-of-text case studies to provide numerous practical examples.The first major textbook that seriously studies HR issues in a Cross-Border Alliances context, this book offers both students of HR/international business and practicing HR professionals alike the frameworks for truly understanding the complexities of the area.

Time series and processes are the natural tools for describing the dynamic behavior of financial data, leading to the required forecasts. This book presents a survey of the empirical properties of financial time series, their descriptions by means of mathematical processes, and some implications for important financial applications used in many areas like risk evaluation, option pricing or portfolio construction. The statistical tools used to extract information from raw data are introduced. Extensive multiscale empirical statistics provide a solid benchmark of stylized facts (heteroskedasticity, long memory, fat-tails, leverage…), in order to assess various mathematical structures that can capture the observed regularities.^ The author introduces a broad range of processes and evaluates them systematically against the benchmark, summarizing the successes and limitations of these models from an empirical point of view. The outcome is that only multiscale ARCH processes with long memory, discrete multiplicative structures and non-normal innovations are able to capture correctly the empirical properties. In particular, only a discrete time series framework allows to capture all the stylized facts in a process, whereas the stochastic calculus used in the continuum limit is too constraining. The present volume offers various applications and extensions for this class of processes including high-frequency volatility estimators, market risk evaluation, covariance estimation and multivariate extensions of the processes. The book discusses many practical implications and is addressed to practitioners and quants in the financial industry, as well as to academics, including graduate (Master or PhD level) students.^ The prerequisites are basic statistics and some elementary financial mathematics.Gilles Zumbach has worked for several institutions, including banks, hedge funds and service providers and continues to be engaged in research on many topics in finance. His primary areas of interest are volatility, ARCH processes and financial applications.  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Inside Cisco,Ed Paulson,business__economics,First published in 2001,/works/OL2033223W?edition=ia%3Ainsideciscoreals0000paul_y9r1,/authors/OL245831A/Ed_Paulson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3579521M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Wiley|Language English|Pages 314,"An insider reveals the core strategies behind Cisco's phenomenal success   Most savvy business observers agree that the major component in Cisco's phenomenal growth has been their unwavering commitment to expanding their product line through aggressive acquisitions. Since 1995, the ""New Goliath,"" as Cisco is known throughout the business and finance communities, has acquired more than sixty companies. In this groundbreaking book, a Silicon Valley veteran, Ed Paulson, uses his strong connections to Cisco's management to reveal the M&A gospel according to Cisco.   Paulson explores how Cisco has used acquisitions to stay ahead of its competitors, analyzes their strategies and proven methods for incorporating new companies seamlessly, positively, and profitably. Paulson reveals the centerpiece of Cisco's acquisition strategy-one that is company-focused, culturally compatible, and retains staff. He examines how Cisco executives determine if a target company is compatible with Cisco's corporate culture and strategic outlook and describes the extraordinary lengths to which these executives will go to gain the loyalty of acquired people. This book details the Cisco methodology and illustrates how it can be applied to companies across industries.   Ed Paulson (Chicago, IL) is President of Technology and Communications, Inc., a business and technology consulting firm and a visiting professor at DePaul University's School for New Training. He is a Silicon Valley veteran with more than two decades of experience and the author of numerous business and technology books, most recently, The Technology M&A Guidebook (Wiley: 0-471-36010-4).

Renowned negotiation expert William Ury has taught tens of thousands of people from all walks of life--managers, lawyers, factory workers, coal miners, schoolteachers, diplomats, and government officials--how to become better negotiators. Over the years, Ury has discovered that the greatest obstacle to successful agreements and satisfying relationships is not the other side, as difficult as they can be. The biggest obstacle is actually our own selves--our natural tendency to react in ways that do not serve our true interests. But this obstacle can also become our biggest opportunity, Ury argues. If we learn to understand and influence ourselves first, we lay the groundwork for understanding and influencing others. In this prequel to Getting to Yes, Ury offers a seven-step method to help you reach agreement with yourself first, dramatically improving your ability to negotiate with others. Practical and effective, Getting to Yes with Yourself helps readers reach good agreements with others, develop healthy relationships, make their businesses more productive, and live far more satisfying lives""--   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

If we fully understood the conditions and controlling variables at restoration sites, we would be better equipped to predict the outcomes of restoration efforts. If there were no constraints, we could merely plant the restoration site and walk away. However, the development of restoration theory has not yet lead to predictability.   The Handbook for Restoring Tidal Wetlands fills an important gap in current restoration ecology literature. It provides a broad-based compilation of case studies and principles to guide the management of tidal restoration sites. Thoroughly illustrated with more than 170 figures and tables, the book covers a full range of topics including:    the conceptual planning for coastal wetlands restoration    strategies for the manipulation of hydrology and soils    the reestablishment of vegetation and assemblages of fishes and invertebrates    the process of assessing, monitoring, and sustaining restored wetlands  Combining detailed examples from coastal research studies along the Pacific coast of southern California with information drawn from the literature on coastal restoration across the globe, the Handbook for Restoring Tidal Wetlands is a must-have guide if you are involved in coastal mitigation and restoration projects.

Yet in today's stock market-driven economy, companies are playing it safe, with too many leaders focused on short-term gains, rather than value creation. The result is a static business culture that generates forgettable results--even as the world demands big solutions. So how do we get back in the risk-taking game? In The Risk Factor, Deborah Perry Piscione takes the most comprehensive look at this crucial, undervalued leadership behavior, and outlines how companies must support risk-taking across the enterprise. Exploring the heroes of risk, including entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and technologists, and the role risk-taking and failure tolerance play in their success, she makes a compelling case not only for big, flashy mergers or acquisitions, but also for unorthodox choices in everything from leadership to corporate social responsibility. Drawing on case studies from a wide range of now-famous giants (Amazon, Netflix) and successful start-ups (Tesla, Box), she distills lessons for both new entrepreneurs and established companies whose longtime risk aversion has cost them more than they realize""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While credibility is the foundation of effective leadership, most leaders struggle, and sometimes fail, to align their words and their actions. Now for  the first time, leadership expert Tony Simons has measured the bottom-line value of business leaders who live by their word and actually do what they say they are going to do. In The Integrity Dividend, Tony Simons shows how leaders? personal integrity drives the profitability and overall success of their organization. This groundbreaking book is based in on solid research and reveals that businesses led by managers of higher integrity enjoy deeper employee commitment, lower turnover, superior customer service, and substantially higher profitability. This improved performance is the integrity dividend.   Simons conducted dozens of focus groups, surveyed thousands of employees, collected financial and operational numbers, and interviewed over 100 senior executives and executive coaches. The book lays out the research clearly and provides proven tools for managing common integrity challenges. It offers guidance for building individual credibility and for creating an organizational culture of integrity and accountability. Throughout, Simons uses real-world insight and stories drawn from senior executives, line managers, and coaches.   The Integrity Dividend is a fresh view of leadership at a time when it is most needed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For example, why do so many companies have evaluation and reward systems that force employees to compete against each other while these same organizations preach the gospel of cooperation and teamwork? Why do companies continue to downsize when this practice has proven antithetical to long-term success?Out of the Box Thinking for Successful Managers explains, in a user-friendly and sometimes humorous manner, why these practices are based on worn-out logic in some cases and complete falsehoods in others. Questioning numerous management practices that have been popular for decades, it details their weaknesses and explains why they continue to hamper attempts to improve productivity. The book reviews a range of management theories, including Six Sigma, downsizing, and management by objective. After showing where the holes lie, it offers alternative approaches that have proven effective in a growing number of private and public sector organizations, including some that enable a more positive workplace culture. Illustrating practical application with case studies, the book provides simple suggestions for change that can be highly beneficial to your organization. It addresses the major myths that managers need to examine and eventually do away with or, at least, replace with modified versions that make more sense in today's increasingly competitive business environment""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It offers a fully up-to-date account of the international developments and structure in the aircraft and aviation industries from a number of perspectives, which include economic, geographical, political and technological points of view. The aircraft industry is characterized by very complex, high technology products produced in relatively small quantities. The high-technology requirements necessitate a high level of R&D. In no other industry is it more of inter-dependence and cross-fertilisation of advanced technology. Consequently, most of the world's large aircraft companies and technology leaders have been located in Europe and North America. During the last few decades many developing countries have tried to build up an internationally competitive aircraft industry. The authors study a number of important issues including the political economy of the aircraft industry, globalization in this industry, innovation, newly industrializing economies and the aircraft industry.

The essays are non-technical and can be used by students of all disciplines interested in capitalism and in economic behaviour. They often present unconventional views of the topics they discuss.

The essays offer a useful supplementary reading source for courses in business, economics, and law that deal with human behaviour in the marketplace and with capitalism, ownership, markets, and firms.

Achieving HR excellence through six sigma,Daniel Bloom,business__economics,First published in 2013,/works/OL23305687W,/authors/OL2951994A/Daniel_Bloom,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Productivity Press|Language English|Pages 187,"""Although world-class firms like GE and Motorola have relied on Six Sigma to build their performance cultures, these processes are all too often left out of human resources (HR) functions. This lack of Six Sigma principles is even more surprising because preventing errors and improving productivity are so critical to the people management processes of hiring, retention, appraisal, and development.From the history and evolution of the Total Quality movement to initiatives for introducing a Six Sigma continuous process improvement strategy in your HR department, Achieving HR Excellence through Six Sigma introduces a new way to envision your role within the organization. It explains how this powerful methodology works and supplies a roadmap to help you find and eliminate waste in your HR processes.Describing exactly what HR excellence means, the book outlines dozens of proven approaches as well as a hierarchy of the exact steps required to achieve it. It illustrates the Six Sigma methodology from the creation of a project to its successful completion. At each stage, it describes the specific tools currently available and provides examples of organizations that have used Six Sigma within HR to improve their organizations.The text presents proven approaches that can help you solve and even eliminate people management problems altogether. Filled with real-world examples, it demonstrates how to implement six sigma into the transformational side of your organization. It also includes a listing of additional resources to help you along your Six Sigma journey.Explaining how to build a new business model for your HR organization, the book supplies the new perspective and broad view you will need to discover and recommend game-changing alternatives to traditional HR approaches in your organization""--  ""Foreword The theme of this book is increasing human resource (HR) excellence through the use of Six Sigma processes and approaches, and it could not be more relevant in today's business climate. The intense competition that firms face requires them to reduce waste and to maximize their quality, efficiency, and rate of continuous improvement. Six Sigma is a well- established business process that contributes to each of these goals. Top firms like Toyota and GE have relied on Six Sigma as an important element in building their performance cultures. Although Six Sigma is not new to business, these processes have only been infrequently applied to the HR function. Cost reduction and control processes can be especially impactful in the area of people management simply because employee costs are themselves so high (the cost of labor can reach as high as 60% of all corporate variable costs). A lack of Six Sigma principles and tools in people management is also surprising because preventing errors and improving quality are of paramount importance in the critical people management processes of hiring, retention, appraisal, and development. Looking at hiring as an example, if you hire a weak employee, that employee will likely begin a job by making numerous errors, which can damage the firm's products and your customer reputation. A weak new hire will also initially require a great deal of management time and training resources""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To this end, a super-ordinate system called ""Discovery Service"" is designed that has to handle large amounts of data, high insert-rates, and a high number of queries that are submitted to the discovery service. An example that is used throughout this book is the European pharmaceutical supply chain, which faces the challenge that more and more counterfeit medicinal products are being introduced. Between October and December 2008, more than 34 million fake drug pills were detected at customs control at the borders of the European Union. These fake drugs can put lives in danger as they were supposed to fight cancer, take effect as painkiller or antibiotics, among others. The concepts described in this book can be adopted for supply chain management use cases other than track and trace, such as recall, supply chain optimization, or supply chain analytics.

It is their most prestigious qualification and is known as the ""MBA of brands."" The culmination of the course is a 5,000-7,000 word essay that focuses on the future of brands and brand communications. What is a 21st Century Brand? is not just a collection of the best essays from the last ten years (since the beginning of the program), it also allows the authors, who have gone on to have successful careers at agencies such as Saatchi & Saatchi, Ogilvy & Mather, and BBDO, to come back and analyze and comment on their original thesis in light of what they know now. It also includes new writing from leading industry thinkers including Stephen Woodford, Chairman at Lexus, and David Wilding, Director of Planning at Twitter UK.With a focus on challenging the status quo, the book asks us to question how we perceive brands, how to build them and, most of all, how to make them better.

With a focus on challenging the status quo, the book asks us to question how we perceive brands, how to build them and, most of all, how to make them better.

With contributions from past candidates now at agencies such as Agency Republic, The Bakery, BBDO, BBH, DDB, Karmarama, MEC, Naked Communications, Saatchi and Saatchi and Ogilvy and Mather, it covers cutting-edge thinking across all areas of advertising and highlights that today's most successful agencies and advertisers are those who are embracing the changes to how the average person consumes content, looking to the future and constantly striving to increase their level of professionalism. By providing insight from multiple perspectives, it is ideal for advertising professionals and planners wishing to further understand brands to advance their careers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Societies are increasingly mobile, and immigrant populations maintain strong ties with their native countries, allowing for an unbroken chain of innovation and knowledge that stretches all the way back home. Robert Guest, Global Business Editor for The Economist, shows how today's tribal networks transcend national borders, and how they are shaping the global community in unforeseen ways, including: So-called ""Chinese sea turtles,"" young Chinese who come to the West for college before returning to China, eagerly absorb democratic ideals along with their technical training. Now, as they assume leadership positions in Chinese government and business, they will slowly turn China democratic. Indian diasporas, having long brought western technology to their home countries, are now bringing Indian technology to the West. They've already developed $70 refrigerators and $2,000 cars; their frugal innovations and managerial know-how are about to turn the global economy on its head. In a world where trade, trust, and information flow through ethnic networks, the nation that values open borders and encourages the growth of its diaspora populations will be the superpower of the twenty-first century. With on-the-ground reporting from dozens of countries, this is a timely look at the forces greater than national boundaries, and how they can be harnessed to move the whole planet forward""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Drawing deeply on Staughton Lynd's experiences as a labor lawyer and activist in Youngstown, OH, and on his profound understanding of the history of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Solidarity Unionism helps us begin to put not only movement but also vision back into the labor movement. While many lament the decline of traditional unions, Lynd takes succor in the blossoming of rank-and-file worker organizations throughout the world that are countering rapacious capitalists and those comfortable labor leaders that think they know more about work and struggle than their own members. If we apply a new measure of workers' power that is deeply rooted in gatherings of workers and communities, the bleak and static perspective about the sorry state of labor today becomes bright and dynamic. To secure the gains of solidarity unions, Staughton has proposed parallel bodies of workers who share the principles of rank-and-file solidarity and can coordinate the activities of local workers' assemblies. Detailed and inspiring examples include experiments in workers' self-organization across industries in steel-producing Youngstown, as well as horizontal networks of solidarity formed in a variety of U.S. cities and successful direct actions overseas. This is a tradition that workers understand but labor leaders reject. After so many failures, it is time to frankly recognize that the century-old system of recognition of a single union as exclusive collective bargaining agent was fatally flawed from the beginning, and doesn't work for most workers. If we are to live with dignity, we must collectively resist. This book is not a prescription but reveals the lived experience of working people continuously taking risks for the common good.

Managing complexity in the public services,Philip Haynes,business__economics,First published in 2015,/works/OL20002898W,/authors/OL37613A/Philip_Haynes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 161,"""The application of complexity theory to management and the social sciences has been a key development in theory and practice over the last decade. This approach questions the possibility of finding universal methods of practice, and proposes a pragmatic and humanistic management style that evolves out of a reflective method. The focus is on practitioners observing patterns of similarity and being adaptable in decision-making.Bringing complexity theory into management reveals the importance of organizational culture and effective communication because people, their values and their objectives are at the heart of this method. Information technology provides a framework for complex communication and knowledge use, but it cannot replace highly developed professional negotiations and cooperation.This book argues that the complexity of the public service world limits the usefulness of classical and rational scientific management approaches such as New Public Management. Excessive marketization threatens a collaborative approach and overly rigid approaches to performance management and strategic management can be dysfunctional.Managing Complexity in the Public Services 2nd Edition advances a method of management practice that copes with the stark realities of the complex and unpredictable public policy world. It develops pragmatic management practices from action research that will be valuable to both academics and practitioners. The result is a new value-based practice for the post-crisis public service world""--  ""Complexity theory has grown in importance over the last decade and its development has enabled a universal method of practice which proposes a pragmatic and humanistic management practice. The application of complexity theory highlights the importance of the development of an organizations culture and communication, it enables them to be dynamic whilst maintaining coherence and stability. It places the workers, their values and mission at the heart of the organizations practices, recognising that information technology may provide a framework for complex communication and knowledge use but cannot replace highly developed professional negotiations and cooperation. This new edition of Managing Complexity in the Public Services argues that the complexity of the public service world limits the usefulness of classical and rational scientific management approaches like the New Public Managerialism (NPM). As a result overly rigid approaches to performance management and strategic management can be highly dysfunctional in the public context. Managing Complexity in the Public Services takes further the articulation of a method of management practice that can cope with the stark realities of the complex and unpredictable public policy world. It develops a number of management practices developed in action research that will be of high use to both academics and practitioners and helps detail how complexity theory can be applied in practice The result is a new value based practice for the post crisis public service world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Painting a compelling portrait of Microsoft's culture, this ready-to-use book encompasses the core principles that propel every Microsoft employee to excel and direct every manager's thought process. Turn to any page and you will find valuable practices and insights that can be applied to your own company.   Imagine how following these Microsoft standards could instantly increase your firm's productivity: Immediately after each project is completed, a ruthless ""post-mortem"" process ignores the project's successes to dissect its failures...and how they can be avoided in the future; Instead of wallowing in profit-induced security, Microsoft immediately begins to develop replacements for its cash-cow products - knowing that if they don't, the competition will; Smaller is not just better, it is essential, but work groups, while functionally independent, still pursue a common strategic plan; Could your company survive outside the 9-to-5 ritual? Find examples of how Microsoft's focus on task completion instead of time clocks leads to unmatched employee morale and superior effort.Can you honestly expect to build a company the size and strength of Microsoft? Possibly not...BUT by adapting Bill Gates's aggressive, common-sense strategies for use in your own company, you CAN position yourself for outstanding growth and success in today's intensely competitive, Microsoft-influenced marketplace.

Why Wall Street matters,William D.

Maybe you hate the greed of Wall Street but know that it's important to the proper functioning of the world economy. Maybe you don't really understand Wall Street, and phrases such as ""credit default swap"" make your eyes glaze over. Maybe you are utterly confused by the fact that after attacking Wall Street mercilessly during his campaign, Donald Trump has surrounded himself with Wall Street veterans. But if you like your smart phone or your widescreen TV, your car or your morning bacon, your pension or your 401(k), then--whether you know it or not--you are a fan of Wall Street. William D. Cohan is no knee-jerk advocate for Wall Street and the big banks. He's one of America's most respected financial journalists and the progressive bestselling author of House of Cards. He has long been critical of the bad behavior that plagued much of Wall Street in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, and because he spent seventeen years as an investment banker on Wall Street, he is an expert on its inner workings as well. But in recent years he's become alarmed by the cheap shots and ceaseless vitriol directed at Wall Street's bankers, traders, and executives--the people whose job it is to provide capital to those who need it, the grease that keeps our economy humming. In this brisk, no-nonsense narrative, Cohan reminds us of the good these institutions do--and the dire consequences for us all if the essential role they play in making our lives better is carelessly curtailed. Praise for William D. Cohan ""Cohan writes with an insider's knowledge of the workings of Wall Street, a reporter's investigative instincts and a natural storyteller's narrative command.""--The New York Times ""[Cohan is] one of our most able financial journalists.""--Los Angeles Times ""A former Wall Street man and a talented writer, [Cohan] has the rare gift not only of understanding the fiendishly complicated goings-on, but also of being able to explain them in terms the lay reader can grasp.""--The Observer (London)""--  ""Anti-bank sentiment has reached a boiling point in America. What started with Occupy Wall Street and Bill Maher satirically calling for the death of Wall Street bankers has culminated with Bernie Sanders pushing the dissolution of the big banks into the official 2016 Democratic platform. But in Cohan's estimation, that sentiment is not only woefully ill-informed, but dangerously naive. Starting with what Wall Street literally is and what it actually does, Cohan swiftly debunks all of the misinformed arguments against it while acknowledging the problems that fuel those feelings. We can be mad at the greed and excess, but at the end of the day, Wall Street is the capital in capitalism, and when its working right, is the invisible engine that powers the ideas we have and the lives we love""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They were not written in isolation from the real and often horrifying events of the 20th century; they were heavily informed by the brilliance and tragedy of his life experiences – including as a refugee forced to flee his home in Vienna – in battling every form of totalitarianism.  I’ve been reading his work since the dawn of my intellectual consciousness but I’ve yet to discover the end of his capacity to illuminate the world around us. I never fail to profit from re-reading even the books I think I understand best. Learning from Mises is a lifelong project. Even so, these five essays carry amazing power, as you will soon discover.”  ~ Jeffrey Tucker, Editorial Director, American Institute for Economic Research  Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises (1881-1973) was an economist, historian, and philosopher. Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of the market order and is best known for his 1949 book Human Action. Mises worked and taught in Vienna until he was driven out by the Nazi movement in 1934. He took sanctuary in Geneva until 1940, immigrated to the United States, and eventually taught at New York University. Mises’s colleague Friedrich Hayek viewed Mises as one of the major figures in the revival of liberalism in the post-war era. Mises’s Private Seminar in Vienna was a formative event for many social scientists of the period, and many of its alumni, including Hayek and Oskar Morgenstern, emigrated from Austria to the United States and Great Britain.

In this book you'll find all of the techniques and tools you need to answer today's crucial go-to-market questions:Which markets offer the best opportunities for profitable growth?What do my target customers need? How can I do a lot more business with them?What mix of channels and partners will help me reach and sell to the most customers at the lowest possible cost? Do I have the right product or solution? How can I create broader customer interest in my offerings?Do I have a winning value proposition? What would make the 'message' more compelling - and drive more purchasing activity?'Go To Market Strategy' is not about incremental change. As Friedman points out, it is for executives seeking nothing less than double-digit revenue growth and the slashing of at least 10-15 percent of selling costs - absolutely realistic results that go-to-market innovators have consistently achieved. This book lays out all of the techniques used by the world's top go-to-market leaders, so you too can achieve those kinds of results, and gain a real go-to-market competitive advantage in your markets.

You are creating a start-up company that targets the Business-to-Business (B2B) market. You have the needed services to offer, markets to supply, a marketing and brand advertising campaign to reach them, a pricing structure (compensation package) that is competitive, and a sales program to land the customer. The one difference is that a start-up business is looking for many customers. You are looking for just one-the right employer.    Of course, just as you must start a business with a plan, you should start your job hunt with one too. The Princeton Management Consultants Guide to Your New Job shows you how to build your successful career using the same powerful, tried-and-true business planning methods that entrepreneurs use to build successful start-ups. You'll market and sell your skills and services to targeted employers, and find the job niche that's right for you.    The innovative methods in this book will help you:   Describe your vision and mission   Describe and define the services you have to offer   Define your target markets   Know what salary, benefits, and stock-ownership opportunities are competitive in your job market   Develop a marketing, branding, and advertising strategy   Package yourself as a product   Launch your sales campaign   Beat the competition and land the job      Instead of following job hunting rules, you will learn to use your ingenuity, intelligence, individuality, and experience to stand out from the crowd-the same way new businesses differentiate themselves from their competition. Rather than scatter your resume among anonymous prospects, you'll achieve success by systematically targeting employers as individuals with specific needs you can fill. Packed with expert advice on relationship marketing, resumes, cover letters, networking, executive recruiters, interviewing, and more, the Princeton Management Consultants Guide to Your New Job is the resource you need to succeed in the business of you.

Hierzu wird ein mikroökonometrisch fundiertes Simulationsmodell genutzt, in das neben offiziellen Bevölkerungsprognosen ein neuartiger, detaillierter Datensatz von knapp 2,5 Millionen Kunden elf deutscher Sparkassen einfließt. Für verschiedene Szenarien werden aus dem Modell Prognosen der Kunden- und Ertragsentwicklung für den deutschen Sparkassensektor bis 2025 auf NUTS II-Ebene abgeleitet. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass für den Sparkassensektor insgesamt eine recht stabile Ertragssituation zu erwarten ist. Für einige Regionen, insbesondere in Ostdeutschland, ergibt sich dagegen eine existenzgefährdende Ertragserosion.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Non-profit organisations (NPOs) are identified as highly emotional. Social interactions within these organisations are shaped by the control mechanism of trust and the guiding principle of solidarity. NPOs rely on interaction among the three social phenomena of trust, solidarity and emotions, which are essential for cooperation and therefore for an organisation to function. This research addresses both the theoretical background and everyday practice of trust, solidarity and emotions and shows the conditions under which they grow and function as well as their interdependencies within NPOs.

That is the message of this brilliant and controversial summary of our current economic predicament from an internationally respected consultant and commentator on financial markets, who predicted the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. The author challenges the assumption that growth can be perpetual and questions the ability of political leaders to enact the tough structural changes needed. He is particularly critical of the ""easy money"" approach to dealing with the great recession of 2008, citing the dangers of excessive debt and deep-seated fundamental imbalances. The fallout of these poor policies, he argues, will affect not only the business sector, but also the lifestyles and prosperity of average citizens and future generations. The author concludes with a thought experiment illustrating the large-scale changes that will be necessary to restore economic, financial, and social sustainability. This experiment has already been tried in Iceland, which went bankrupt in the wake of the 2008 crisis, and now, after a painful adjustment, is on the road to recovery. Written for the lay reader and peppered with witty anecdotes, this immensely readable book clearly explains the missteps that created the current dilemma, why a recovery has proved elusive, and the difficult remedies that must eventually be applied to ensure a stable future""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

If consumers make decisions unconsciously, why do we persist in asking them directly through traditional marketing research why they do what they do?  They simply can't tell us because they don't really know. Before marketers develop strategies, they need to recognize that consumers have strategies too...human strategies, not consumer strategies. We need to go beyond asking why, and begin to ask how, behavior change occurs.  Here, author Douglas Van Praet takes the most brilliant and revolutionary concepts from cognitive science and applies them to how we market, advertise, and consume in the modern digital age.  Van Praet simplifies the most complex object in the known universe - the human brain - into seven codified actionable steps to behavior change.  These steps are illustrated using real world examples from advertising, marketing, media and business to consciously unravel what brilliant marketers and ad practitioners have long done intuitively, deconstructing the real story behind some of the greatest marketing and business successes in recent history, such as Nike's ""Just Do It"" campaign; ""Got Milk?"";  Wendy's ""Where's the Beef?"" ; and the infamous Volkswagen ""Punch Buggy"" launch as well as their beloved ""The Force"" (Mini Darth Vader) Super Bowl commercial""--   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ideas of environmentalism' are often broad and imprecise, holding neither meaning nor currency. Environmentalism and Mass Media sheds new light on the diverse ideas ofenvironmentalism', the way environmental ideas circulate, and public reaction to environmental concerns conveyed by the media.

It describes how BPM treats processes as a portfolio of strategic assets that create and deliver customer and shareholder value and adapt, when necessary, enabling competitive advantage through consistent performance. Strategy and Business Process Management: Techniques for Improving Execution, Adaptability, and Consistency defines the planning framework and managerial mindset necessary to craft and drive highly effective business process improvement projects and continuous improvement programs. Readers will learn specific techniques used by industry leaders to formulate and execute business strategy that adapts organizational behavior, business processes and information technology as a dynamic system designed to assure consistent performance and achievement, even when challenged with unexpected change or opportunity""--  ""Preface ABOUT THIS BOOK Running a business often requires leaders and management teams to do things better and faster with fewer resources and at lower cost. Some organizations always seem to adapt and flourish at this and others struggle. Why? Those that succeed do so because they always look at how they do things and continuously ask, ""How can we run our business better?"" They answer the question by first learning the best practices of other highly successful organizations. Next, they look inward, studying how they currently do things. They then take what they've learned and experiment with changes, testing new ways to work smarter, better, and faster at lower cost using the resources at hand. But doing this requires research, knowledge, planning, and tools. Proficiency and skills must be garnered from several disciplines that include the following - Crafting and adapting a competitive and defensible business strategy - Translating business strategy into action - Empowering and motivating the workforce - Designing effective and efficient business processes - Implementing information technology for cost-effective execution - Aligning resources such as people, processes, and technology to consistently execute business strategy Execution requires mastery of several skills including the following: - Insightful leadership capable of orchestrating a multidisciplinary management team""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whether we're starting out, striving toward a promotion, or looking for a new opportunity, the working world isn't what it used to be. Wall Street veteran Carla Harris knows this, and in Strategize to Win she gives readers the tools they need to get started; get ""unstuck"" from bad situations; redirect momentum; and position themselves to manage their careers no matter the environment. With her trademark galvanizing advice, Harris identifies and clarifies issues that are often murky, offering lessons on: Identifying and making the most of your work profile (are you a Good Soldier? a Leader? an Arguer?); preparing for a career change without going back to school or taking a step down: honing three essential skills industry leaders possess (and how to get them); tuning into unspoken cues; and thriving through change. Introducing a new way of planning one's career in five-year units, Strategize to Win distills battle-tested and step-by-step tools that Carla has used to launch and sustain her own successful career and help others move forward, recover from setbacks, and position themselves for success. - Publisher.

It's not the NSA, but good-old American companies. Internet giants, leading retailers and other firms are gathering data behind the scenes with little oversight from anyone. ""This is the information age, and information is power!"" screamed DocuSearch, ""America's Premier Resource for Private Investigator Searches & Lookups"" in 1996-and they were right. In Las Vegas, no company knows this mantra better than Caesars Entertainment. Despite the fact that its Vegas casinos are decades old and can't boast their rivals' singing gondoliers or fountains exploding in a choreographed dance, many thousands of enthusiastic clients continue to pour through the ever-open doors of Caesars hotels. The secret to the company's success lies in their one unrivaled asset: they are able to track the activities of the overwhelming majority of gamblers who walk in. They know exactly what games we like to play, what foods we enjoy for breakfast, when we prefer to visit, who our favorite hostess might be and exactly how to keep us coming back for more. Caesars' dogged data-gathering methods have been so successful that they grew to become the world's largest casino operator, and they have inspired companies from across industries to ramp up their own data mining in the hopes of boosting their targeted marketing efforts. Some do this themselves. Some rely on data brokers. Others clearly enter a moral gray zone that would make American consumers deeply uncomfortable. Even if you've never set foot in a casino or signed up for an airline's frequent flier program, companies little-known to the public like Acxiom are still gathering information on you at every turn. And there are those, such as PeopleSmart and Instant Checkmate, that will sell your dossier to anyone for cash. The reality is that we live in an age where our personal information is harvested and aggregated whether we like it or not. And it is growing ever more difficult for those businesses that choose not engage in more intrusive data gathering to compete with those that do. Tanner's timely warning resounds: yes, there are many benefits to the free flow of all this data, but there is a dark side as well. With societal and legal boundaries on the use of personal data still largely undefined, the potential for abuse looms large. And, as to what stays in Vegas? The answer: almost nothing""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Advanced economies have experienced a tremendous increase in material well- being since the industrial revolution. Modern innovations such as personal computers, laser surgery, jet airplanes, and satellite communication have made us rich and transformed the way we live and work. But technological change has also brought with it a variety of social problems. It has been blamed at various times for increasing wage and income inequality, unemployment, obsolescence of physical and human capital, environmental deterioration, and prolonged recessions.  To understand the contradictory effects of technological change on the economy, one must delve into structural details of the innovation process to analyze how laws, institutions, customs, and regulations affect peoples' incentive and ability to create new knowledge and profit from it. To show how this can be done, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt make use of Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction, the competitive process whereby entrepreneurs constantly seek new ideas that will render their rivals' ideas obsolete.  Whereas other books on endogenous growth stress a particular aspect, such as trade or convergence, this book provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical and empirical debates raised by modern growth theory. It develops a powerful engine of analysis that sheds light not only on economic growth per se, but on the many other phenomena that interact with growth, such as inequality, unemployment, capital accumulation, education, competition, natural resources, international trade, economic cycles, and public policy.    source: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/endogenous-growth-theory   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It's an axiom of business that great companies grow their revenues and profits year after year. Yet quietly, under the radar, a small number of companies have rejected the pressure of endless growth to focus on more satisfying business goals. Goals like being great at what they do, creating a great place to work, providing great customer service, making great contributions to their communities, and finding great ways to lead their lives. InSmall Giants, veteran journalist Bo Burlingham takes us deep inside fourteen remarkable companies that have chosen to march to their own drummer. They include Anchor Brewing, the original microbrewer; CitiStorage Inc., the premier independent records-storage business; Clif Bar & Co., maker of organic energy bars and other nutrition foods; Righteous Babe Records, the record company founded by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco; Union Square Hospitality Group, the company of restaurateur Danny Meyer; and Zingerman's Community of Businesses, including the world-famous Zingerman's Deli of Ann Arbor. Burlingham shows how the leaders of these small giants recognized the full range of choices they had about the type of company they could create. And he shows how we can all benefit by questioning the usual definitions of business success. In his new afterward, Burlingham reflects on the similarities and learning lessons from the small giants he covers in the book.

Even companies committed to jabbing--patiently engaging with customers to build the relationships crucial to successful social media campaigns--want to land the punch that will take down their opponent or their customer's resistance in one blow. Right hooks convert traffic to sales and easily show results. Except when they don't. Thanks to massive change and proliferation in social media platforms, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now. Vaynerchuk shows that while communication is still key, context matters more than ever. It's not just about developing high-quality content, but developing high-quality content perfectly adapted to specific social media platforms and mobile devices--content tailor-made for Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Tumblr""--   Read more Read less",44 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Moving beyond attempts to define and defend the ""Third Way"", this collection embarks upon a critical examination of this key concept. The editors draw on expert contributions from a range of disciplines and perspectives to dissect the ""Third Way"" in theory and practice, assess its legacy and suggest alternatives.  The book begins by reviewing attempts to define the ""Third Way"". It then examines what the ""Third Way"" implies for our understanding of the economy and the state, before critically assessing the philosophical and practical implications of its attempts to use the term ""community"". The final section deconstructs ""Third Way"" rhetoric and discourse. The conclusion reviews how these critical insights might form a basis for alternative political projects.  Written in a rigorous but accessible style, this interdisciplinary collection should be useful reading for anyone with an interest in understanding a key idea propounded by New Labour and the contemporary centre-left. It should appeal to anyone studying politics, sociology, contemporary history, social policy, social and political theory, and applied philosophy. It provides both an introduction to the topic and new and original insights for specialists in the area.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Zeroes is a memoir of the excesses and bad behavior from an outsider who got pulled into a crazy, self- contained world. Among his eye-popping true stories:How fortunes were made, from the million-dollar score made in the thirty-minute gap between the collapse of the two Twin Towers on 9/11, to the man who personally made $4 billion from the 2008 housing meltdown.How fortunes were spent, from Lane's $1,000-per-seat trader-versus- trader boxing matches to $60 million bidding wars for Gulfstream jets.How Lane crossed paths with dozens of famous people who tried to cash in on the feeding frenzy or found themselves in the middle of it, including Diana Ross, Alex Rodriguez, Al Gore, John Travolta, half the 1986 Mets, and virtually every major player involved in the economic collapse.When the crash hit, Lane's company and personal portfolio were destroyed along with the high-flying traders his magazines celebrated. The Wall Street Journal called his magazines' demise ""one of those moments when a chance arrow of history scores a perfect bull's- eye on a deserving target."" Even Lane has to agree.In the tradition of Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker, this memoir will serve as a timeless reference when people in the future ask, ""What were the Zeroes really like?""

Beginners need inspiration and help. Foundations of Economics breathes new life into an often-times dry discipline by linking key economic concepts with wider debates and issues. By bringing to light delightful mind-teasers, philosophical questions and intriguing politics in mainstream economics, it promises to enliven an otherwise dry course whilst inspiring students to do well. The book covers all the main economic concepts and addresses in detail three main areas: * consumption and choice * production and markets * government and the State. Each is discussed in terms of what the conventional textbook says, how these ideas developed in historical and philosophical terms and whether or not they make sense. Assumptions about economics as a discipline are challenged, and several pertinent students' anxieties ('Should I be studying economics?') are discussed.

This book takes its point of departure from a 2016 OECD report that contends that the impact digitalization has on the future of labor is ambiguous, as on the one hand it is suggested that technological change is labor-saving, but on the other hand, it is suggested that digital technologies have not created new jobs on a scale that it replaces old jobs.

Following the author's methodology, the reader will be better able to devise and implement nontraditional solutions to seemingly intractable complex problems. By challenging the reader to think in new and creative ways, the book offers a road map to success, whether measured in terms of competitive advantage, greater market share, improved productivity, or higher profits, all based upon better solutions to difficult problems.    The first four chapters set the foundation for creative thinking by exploring the nature of large-scale systems and complexity, thinking inside and outside the box, and examples of how an inventive mind solves problems in both management and scientific domains. Subsequent chapters address nine focused methods that the author has formulated to help the reader think outside the box:   Broaden and generalize   Crossover   Question conventional wisdom   Back of the envelope   Expanding the dimensions   Obversity   Remove constraints   Thinking with pictures   Systems approach    Real-life examples are provided for each method that demonstrate how the approach enhances problem solving and decision making in system development and management. Following the discussion of the nine methods, the author examines group decision making as well as additional creative thinking procedures devised by other researchers, including references that assist in exploring these methods in greater detail. The author ends with a wrap-up chapter that includes a test to help readers practice their tendencies toward creative thinking skills and action with respect to solving real-world problems.    The nine methods discussed in this book have broad applicability and can be used successfully by managers with a wide range of responsibilities in business and technology. For anyone who is tired of the same old approach with the same old results, this book is essential reading.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now Jagdish Bhagwati, the internationally renowned economist known equally for the clarity of his arguments and the sharpness of his pen, takes on the critics, revealing that globalization, when properly governed, is in fact the most powerful force for social good in the world today. Drawing onhis unparalleled knowledge of international economics, Bhagwati explains why the ""gotcha"" examples of the critics are often not as they seem, and that in fact globalization often alleviates many of the problems for which it has been blamed...

That is the scenario media guru Nicholas Negroponte predicted in the 1990s, with his hypothetical online newspaper The Daily Me - and it is one we experience now in daily ways. But, as media expert Joseph Turow shows, the customized media environment we inhabit today reflects diminished consumer power. Not only ads and discounts but even news and entertainment are being customized by newly powerful media agencies on the basis of data we don't know they are collecting and individualized profiles we don't know we have. Little is known about this new industry: how is this data being collected and analyzed? And how are our profiles created and used? How do you know if you have been identified as a ""target"" or ""waste"" or placed in one of the industry's finer-grained marketing niches? Are you, for example, a Socially Liberal Organic Eater, a Diabetic Individual in the Household, or Single City Struggler? And, if so, how does that affect what you see and do online? Drawing on groundbreaking research, including interviews with industry insiders, this important book shows how advertisers have come to wield such power over individuals and media outlets -and what can be done to stop it""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Farsighted investors will realize enormous profits by investing in companies that benefit from Asia's historic transformation. In The Silk Road to Riches, a team of world-class financial analysts and newsletter editors point you to the right companies, the right sectors, and the right strategies.  You'll learn how to leverage Asia's accelerating integration into the world economy... profit from the pressure that Asia's growth is placing on commodities and resources... anticipate changing needs of Asian consumers in financial services, health and pharmaceuticals, communications, and many other industries.   The authors offer powerful support for several provocative claims: that India, not China, is Asia's best investment destination; that the price of gold is poised to explode; and much more. They illuminate global economic changes that will decide the fate of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency; and present an up-to-the-minute overview of crucial global security issues every investor must understand, no matter where they invest.

The specific case of countries located in the southern periphery region has come to the centre stage, due to the harsh economic conditions that all these countries have experienced in the recent past. In the aftermath of the American subprime credit bubble, these countries, high indebtedness raised doubts as to their ability to sustain public finances, with the financial crisis developing and gaining momentum due to the fragilities presented in the economy. To varying degrees of severity, all of these economies have since been forced to introduce strong fiscal tightening programmes in order to achieve fiscal consolidation, which have translated into recession and rising unemployment. This book undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the causes of the crisis in southern European countries, showing that the 'Achilles heel' of these economies is rooted in the dismal evolution of productivity and in a specialisation pattern excessively based on the so-called 'traditional, ' low, and low-medium tech industries, which yield low margins, declining export shares and, ultimately, withering international competitiveness. Such evidence suggests that the southern European periphery industrial growth model has reached its limits, demanding a multidimensional policy approach capable of overcoming the magnitude and complexity of the present crisis. Without denying the need to adjust public and private balance sheets, it is argued that finding a sustainable path out of the present problems requires addressing the challenges of productivity growth and competitiveness in the long term.

East Asian nations embarked on very different trajectories to this common external shock. The Asian Crisis affected the inter-relationships among the socio-cultural environment, the state, and the market of each country quite differently and had distinct effects on the operations of these countries' business groups. This slow yet divergent pattern of development provides evidence against theories of rapid global convergence.""

Those buying a further copy of this popular book will be interested to see new case histories alongside news about some of the people mentioned in the first edition.Author of ten bestsellers on life and its problems, Dorothy Rowe is a clinical psychologist who now devotes her time to research, writing and teaching.

In fact, as Liaquat Ahamed reveals, it was the decisions taken by a small number of central bankers that were the primary cause of the economic meltdown, the effects of which set the stage for World War II and reverberated for decades.In Lords of Finance, we meet the neurotic and enigmatic Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, the xenophobic and suspicious Emile Moreau of the Banque de France, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, and Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose facade of energy and drive masked a deeply wounded and overburdened man. After the First World War, these central bankers attempted to reconstruct the world of international finance. Despite their differences, they were united by a common fear—that the greatest threat to capitalism was inflation— and by a common vision that the solution was to turn back the clock and return the world to the gold standard.For a brief period in the mid-1920s they appeared to have succeeded. The world's currencies were stabilized and capital began flowing freely across the globe. But beneath the veneer of boom-town prosperity, cracks started to appear in the financial system. The gold standard that all had believed would provide an umbrella of stability proved to be a straitjacket, and the world economy began that terrible downward spiral known as the Great Depression.As yet another period of economic turmoil makes headlines today, the Great Depression and the year 1929 remain the benchmark for true financial mayhem. Offering a new understanding of the global nature of financial crises, Lords of Finance is a potent reminder of the enormous impact that the decisions of central bankers can have, of their fallibility, and of the terrible human consequences that can result when they are wrong.

This was the legacy of apartheid. Twenty years later, poverty was still widespread. Seekings and Nattrass explain why poverty has persisted in South Africa since 1994. They demonstrate who has and who has not remained poor, how public policies both mitigated and reproduced poverty, and how and why these policies were adopted. Their analysis of the South African welfare state, labour market policies and the growth path of the South African economy challenge conventional accounts that focus only on 'neoliberalism'. They argue, instead, that policies were, in important respects, social democratic. They show how social democratic policies both mitigate and reproduce poverty in contexts such as South Africa, reflecting the contradictory nature of social democracy in the global South""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In a sport constantly dogged by blood-doping scandals, he seemed above the fray. Then, in January 2013, the legend imploded. He admitted doping during the Tours and, in an interview with Oprah, described his ""mythic, perfect story"" as ""one big lie."" But his admission raised more questions than it answered - the full story is much bigger than the fall of one sporting hero. Wall Street Journal reporters Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell broke the news at every turn. In Wheelmen they reveal the broader story of how Armstrong and his supporters used money, power, and cutting-edge science to conquer the world's most difficult race. Wheelmen introduces U.S. Postal Service Team owner Thom Weisel, who in a brazen power play ousted USA Cycling's top leadership and gained control of the sport in the United States, ensuring Armstrong's dominance. It reveals the competitiveness and ingenuity that sparked blood-doping as an accepted practice, and shows how the Americans methodically constructed an international operation of spies and revolutionary technology to reach the top. Wheelmen paints a compelling and vivid portrait of what is, without question, the greatest conspiracy in the history of sport.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read
Money and finance in Central Europe during the later middle ages,Roman Zaoral,business__economics,First published in 2015,/works/OL22318887W,/authors/OL8536498A/Roman_Zaoral,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""The wealth of the Central European archives, particularly in urban records, has perhaps not been fully realised by western European historians. However, these records are not always straightforward to use and these studies also tackle the methodological problems inherent in gathering and analysing medieval sources.  This book presents an original review of past and present research of national historiographies on medieval financial history from Central Europe. Covering material ranging from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it explores the eastern regions of the Holy Roman Empire, including Bohemia, Silesia, Austria and Germany, and extends to Poland and Hungary. The authors firstly discuss the monetary policy of the Holy Roman emperors during the Middle Ages, before moving on to the wider aspects of state finance, including credit mechanisms used by rulers. The book then investigates civic records and what they reveal about urban life and trade. The book lastly investigates the financial activities of the church, from papacy to the cathedral chapters in Prague.  Using numismatic and documentary evidence, this book provides an invaluable point of comparison with the financial conditions in Western Europe during the Middle Ages""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Measuring tomorrow,Éloi Laurent,business__economics,First published in 2017,/works/OL19751764W,/authors/OL7033168A/Éloi_Laurent,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 219,"""How moving beyond GDP will improve well-being and sustainability Never before in human history have we produced so much data, and this empirical revolution has shaped economic research and policy profoundly. But are we measuring, and thus managing, the right things--those that will help us solve the real social, economic, political, and environmental challenges of the twenty-first century? In Measuring Tomorrow, Eloi Laurent argues that we need to move away from narrowly useful metrics such as gross domestic product and instead use broader ones that aim at well-being, resilience, and sustainability. By doing so, countries will be able to shift their focus away from infinite and unrealistic growth and toward social justice and quality of life for their citizens. The time has come for these broader metrics to become more than just descriptive, Laurent argues; applied carefully by private and public decision makers, they can foster genuine progress. He begins by taking stock of the booming field of well-being and sustainability indicators, and explains the insights that the best of these can offer. He then shows how these indicators can be used to develop new policies, from the local to the global. An essential resource for scholars, students, and policymakers, Measuring Tomorrow covers all aspects of well-being--including health, education, and the environment--and incorporates a broad range of data and fascinating case studies from around the world: not just the United States and Europe but also China, Africa, the Middle East, and India.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This framework facilitates a comprehensive study of Canada's social sector, an area often neglected in the business curricula despite the important role that these organizations play in Canada's economy. This resource presents a unique set of case studies as well as chapters on organizational design and governance, social finance and social accounting, and accountability. The examples provide much needed context for students and allow for an original and in-depth examination of the relationships between Canada's social infrastructure and the public and private sectors. With this work, Quarter, Mook, and Armstrong illuminate a neglected facet of business studies to further our understanding of the Canadian economy.

Search has become woven into our everyday lives, and permeates offline as well as online activities.   Every business should have a search strategy. How a business appears online can impact consumer influence as much as if not more than offline advertising like TV commercials. A business's search strategy can have a dramatic impact on how consumers interact with that business.   But even more importantly, search engine activity provides amazingly useful data about customer behavior, needs, and motivations. Accessing search data is like conducting focus groups with millions of people for free. Search isn't just for marketers and techies. It can provide valuable insight on business strategy and product strategy.   Companies of all sizes -- from startups to global enterprise level corporations, and even businesses without web sites -- can benefit from understanding how consumers are searching for them and talking about them online, both as a powerful acquisition channel and a vast repository of market research.   In this non-technical book forexecutives, business owners, marketers, and product managers, search engine strategy guru Vanessa Fox-who created Google's portal for site owners, Googgle Webmaster Central -explains what every marketer or business owner needs to understand about how search rankings work, how to use search to better understand your customers and attract new ones, how to develop a comprehensive search strategy for your business, and how to build execution of this strategy into the businesses processes. This isn't another book about paid search for advertisers. This book focuses on organic listings -- the unpaid results that receive 86% of searcher clicks.    Written by search engine guru Vanessa Fox, formerly Google's search engine strategy spokesperson and creator of Google Webmaster Central  Explains from a businessperson's perspective how to develop a successful search engine strategy  Shows how to use the easily accessible data from search engines to increase qualified traffic, better understand customers, and strengthen customer relationships  Reveals how smaller companies can leverage search engine marketing to achieve parity with larger brands     With this book in hand, every businessperson will have the knowledge and the tools to maximize the potential of search engine marketing to build a brand, draw new prospects, and generate sales.

Much better. So much better in fact, that for 40 years, despite demand for natural resources growing, the cost of those resources decreased. Not anymore. Since 2000, prices for the world's natural resources have been steadily rising. The old linear model of business - take-make-waste, where profit depends upon managing resources in the production of products - is not only environmental suicide, it's also business suicide. Businesses now need the 'Circular Advantage' - where growth no longer equals increased resource use, where products are regenerative by design and where resources move back and forth between production and consumption with minimal loss in quality or value. By decoupling growth from resource use, organizations protect themselves from rising and volatile commodity prices, become more resilient to supply disruptions, and reduce their environmental footprint. They also extend their core customer value chain beyond design, production and sales into product use -- where most customer value is created. In Waste to Wealth the authors examine five new business models that provide circular growth - from deploying sustainable resources to the sharing economy - before setting out what business leaders need to do to implement the models successfully. They prove that Green and Growth are not binary alternatives - that there are ways smart firms can make fair profits while delivering great products to customers and that those customers will be able to use those products in a world fit for our children to inherit.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Forget computers. The old rules are broken. Today, communication, not computation, drives change. We are rushing into a world where connectivity is everything, and where old business know-how means nothing. In this new economic order, success flows primarily from understanding networks, and networks have their own rules. In New Rules for the New Economy, Kelly presents ten fundamental principles of the connected economy that invert the traditional wisdom of the industrial world.Succinct and memorable, New Rules explains why these powerful laws are already hardwired into the new economy, and how they play out in all kinds of business--both low and high tech--all over the world. More than an overview of new economic principles, it prescribes clear and specific strategies for success in the network economy. For any worker, CEO, or middle manager, New Rules is the survival kit for the new economy.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress, to measure what mattered. Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked. In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention. Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations, helping a new generation of leaders capture the same magic.

Competition in the Promised Land provides a comprehensive account of the long-lasting effects of the influx of black workers on labor markets and urban space in receiving areas. Traditionally, the Great Black Migration has been lauded as a path to general black economic progress. Leah Boustan challenges this view, arguing instead that the migration produced winners and losers within the black community. Boustan shows that migrants themselves gained tremendously, more than doubling their earnings by moving North. But these new arrivals competed with existing black workers, limiting black-white wage convergence in Northern labor markets and slowing black economic growth. Furthermore, many white households responded to the black migration by relocating to the suburbs. White flight was motivated not only by neighborhood racial change but also by the desire on the part of white residents to avoid local public services and fiscal obligations in increasingly diverse cities. Employing historical census data and state-of-the-art econometric methods, Competition in the Promised Land revises our understanding of the Great Black Migration and its role in the transformation of American society.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Named after the now-iconic doughnut? image that Raworth first drew to depict a sweet spot of human prosperity (an image that appealed to the Occupy Movement, the United Nations, eco-activists, and business leaders alike), Doughnut Economics offers a radically new compass for guiding global development, government policy, and corporate strategy, and sets new standards for what economic success looks like.

Indeed, the reduction of the energy consumption of existing buildings is as least as important as the design of new low-energy buildings. Controlling energy use is one thing, but it is important to assess or estimate it, and to understand the range of interventions for reducing its use and the methods for assessing the cost effectiveness of these measures. This comprehensive guide clearly and concisely covers the various issues from a theoretical standpoint and provides practical, worked examples where appropriate, along with examples of how the calculations are carried out. Topics covered include:where and how energy is used in buildings energy audits measuring and monitoring energy use techniques for reducing energy use in buildings legislative issues.It provides a template for instigating the energy management process within an organization, as well as guidance on management issues such as employee motivation, and gives practical details on how to carry it through.

Consequently, the history of building conservation, the study of contemporary paradigms and case studies in most universities and within wider interest circles, predominantly in the UK, Europe, and USA focus mainly on Europe and sometimes the USA, although the latter is often excluded from European publications. With an increasingly multicultural student body in Euro-American universities and with a rising global interest in heritage preservation, there is an urgent need for publications to cover a larger geographical and social area including not only Asia, Australia, Africa and South America but also previously neglected countries in Europe like the new members of the European Community and the northern neighbour of the USA, Canada. The inclusion of the 'other' in built environment education in general and in building conservation in particular is a pre-requisite of cultural interaction and widening participation.International Heritage and Historic Building Conservation assesses successful contemporary conservation paradigms from around the world. The book evaluates conservation case studies from previously excluded areas of the world to create an integrated account of Historic Building Conservation that crosses the boundaries of language and culture and sets an example for further inclusive research. Analyzing the influence of financial constraints, regional conflicts, and cultural differences on the heritage of disadvantaged countries, this leading-edge volume is essential for researchers and students of heritage studies interested in understanding their topics in a wider framework.

What's most important is what comes next, cutting down internal set-up times and achieving changeovers that last only a few minutes.Quick Changeover Concepts Applied: Dramatically Reduce Set-Up Time and Increase Production Flexibility with SMED provides a comprehensive overview of changeovers from a strategic, tactical, and operational perspective. It outlines specific strategies that can help readers shorten internal set-up steps through the physical analysis of machine elements. The method presented is the result of a synthesis of Shigeo Shingo's classic single-minute exchange of die (SMED) methodology with modern engineering techniques. Providing readers with the understanding required to significantly reduce internal set-up times, the book explains why efficient changeovers are critical to production scheduling. It redefines set-up and set-up time and details a step-by-step method for developing quick changeover methods in a manner where changes can be realized with minimal spending. Properly implemented, the quick changeover concepts presented, can help you reduce set-up times by up to 95 percent.The book uses language that is easy to understand to make it accessible to all functions along the value stream--from shop floor operators and industrial engineers to machine designers. It introduces the concept of systems engineering, explains the set-up process and its various elements, and addresses the financial aspects of set-up.Maintaining an analytical focus, the text describes the theoretical details and includes numerous application examples for every step. It also includes an extensive chapter on fasteners and connection material that presents alternative methods to connect elements that can save you valuable time""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

America the Principled: 6 Opportunities for Becoming a Can-do Nation Once Again,Rosabeth Moss Kanter,business__economics,First published in 2007,/works/OL2625214W?edition=ia%3Aamericaprinciple00kant,/authors/OL382494A/Rosabeth_Moss_Kanter,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17992035M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Crown Publishers|Language English,"Sometimes it seems that Americans are divided in countless ways--red or blue; black, brown, or white; rich or poor; male or female. What happened to America as the land of freedom and openness? In America the Principled, renowned Harvard Business School professor and bestselling author Rosabeth Moss Kanter tackles the hardest questions our nation faces, and challenges us to recommit ourselves to pursuing our nation's noblest goals: equality and opportunity.As our open minds, open markets, and open borders--our nation's highest ideals--are besieged by ideologues and zealots, Dr. Kanter shows us how to recapture the American Dream. Artfully mixing practical ideas with compassionate guidance, she reminds us that the stakes have never been higher: Our economic vitality and democratic ideals are both at risk. In order to compete in the global market, we must invest in people and ideas, reward hard work, value dialogue and debate, and listen to dissenting voices. We must curtail our desire for worldwide empire, build bridges through citizen diplomacy, and pursue happiness instead of hegemony. Dr. Kanter proposes six vital items on the agenda for restoring American strengths: - Widening the net of prosperity by creating opportunities for people of all social and economic classes to participate in the science-based ""white coat"" economy. We can't afford to have large segments of people--and areas of our country--existing outside the foundations of our future, innovation-seeking society. - Supporting real family values through fair and flexible workplaces that reduce stress and close gender gaps, enabling people to earn a living, be productive, and have the time and energy for the other side of life - Ridding the private sector of imperial excess by instilling a values-based capitalism of businesses that are well run, make lots of money, and do lots of good - Reinventing government and stop denigrating it so that when the next Katrina strikes, we have the right people in place with the motivation, capability, and resources to deal with it- Doing something about the ""Ugly American"" by earning back the respect that we have lost in the last six years through individual grass-roots engagement with people in other countries - Moving from ""me"" to ""we"" through national service programs that tap both young people as well as aging baby boomers to create a community ethos that unites people behind common purposesEmpowering and surprisingly optimistic, America the Principled urges us to work together for a bright future we'll be proud to share, having earned the respect of the world once more--and shows us how to do it.From the Hardcover edition.

Among these methods, mathematical programming models play a key role in optimizing a system. However, traditional mathematical programming focuses on single-objective optimization rather than multi-objective optimization as we encounter in real situation. Hence, the concept of multi-objective programming was proposed by Kuhn, Tucker and Koopmans in 1951 and since then became the main-stream of mathematical programming. Multi-objective programming (MOP) can be considered as the natural extension of single-objective programming by simultaneously optimizing multi-objectives in mathematical programming models. However, the optimization of multi-objectives triggers the issue of the Pareto solutions and complicates the derived answer. In addition, more scholars incorporate the concepts of fuzzy sets and evolutionary algorithms to multi-objective programming models and enrich the field of multi-objective decision making (MODM). The content of this book is divided into two parts: methodologies and applications. In the first part, we introduced most popular methods which are used to calculate the solution of MOP in the field of MODM. Furthermore, we included three new topics of MODM: multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA), expanding De Novo programming to changeable spaces, including decision space and objective space, and network data envelopment analysis (NDEA) in this book. In the application part, we proposed different kind of practical applications in MODM. These applications can provide readers the insights for better understanding the MODM with depth.

And that is the incredible power of grit, perseverance, perspiration, determination, and sheer stick-to-it-tiveness. We are all dazzled by the notion that there are some people who get ahead, who reach the corner office because they are simply gifted, or well-connected, or both. But research shows that we far overvalue talent and intellectual ability in our culture. The fact is, so many people get ahead--even the gifted ones--because they worked incredibly hard, put in the thousands of hours of practice and extra sweat equity, and made their own luck. And Linda and Robin should know--they are two girls from the Bronx who had no special advantages or privileges and rose up through their own hard work and relentless drive to succeed to the top of their highly competitive profession. In a book illustrated with a cornucopia of stories and the latest research on success, the authors reveal the strategies that helped them, and countless others, succeed at the highest levels in their careers and professions, and in their personal lives. They talk about the guts--the courage--necessary to take on tough challenges and not give up at the first sign of difficulty. They discuss the essential quality of resiliency. Everyone suffers setbacks in their careers and in life. The key, however, is to pick yourself up and bounce back. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology, they discuss why optimists do better in school, work, and on the playing field--and how to reset that optimistic set point. They talk about industriousness, the notion that Malcolm Gladwell popularized with the 10,000-hour rule in his book Outliers. Creativity theorist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes it takes a minimum of 10 years for one's true creative potential to be realized. And the authors explore the concept of tenacity--the quality that allows us to remain focused and avoid distraction in order to get the job done--an increasingly difficult task in today's fragmented, cluttered, high-tech, connected world. Written in the same short, concise format as The Power of Nice and leavened with the natural humor that characterizes Linda's and Robin's lives--and books--Grit to Great is destined to be the book everyone in business needs""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Millennials have a lot of reputations these days, but powerful, smart, and affective are not usually the adjectives used to describe them. Jared Kleinert and Stacey Ferreira want to change that and empower these young people to follow their dreams, set goals, and achieve success. Both young successful entrepreneurs themselves, they believe in breaking down age barriers to make a difference. Jared, best-known as the Founder and CEO of Synergist, and Stacey, best-known as the Co-Founder of MySocialCloud.com met in 2012 at the Under 20 Thiel Fellowship Summit. After speaking with their equally impressive peers, they realized that these 2 billion young voices have inspiring stories to share with the world and they wanted to bring them to life through 2 Billion Under 20. Jared and Stacey also decided to start an online community, www.2BillionUnder20.com where young people could help each other grow and develop their dreams into reality. They've curated an anthology of amazing stories from their peers. Contributors like Paige McKenzie who started her own YouTube channel at the age of 16 that now has more than 55 million views and Jack Andraka who created an early detection Pancreatic cancer test at age 14 have joined forces to show the world that age is just a number""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The vehicle used by organizations for such constant reinvention is a business transformation program. This book illustrates a tested program management roadmap along with the supporting comprehensive frameworks to successfully execute business transformation programs, formulated strategies, and strategic initiatives. It outlines the steps to successfully transform any business and deliver tangible business outcomes. This breakthrough work establishes the linkage between strategy formulation and strategy execution through the program management discipline.

The author details the processes, techniques, and tools that a program management team can customize and easily implement on any type of strategic initiative within the private or public sector environment to deliver and sustain the expected business outcomes and benefits. This book discusses the ten mandatory steps (or roadmap) needed to lead complex, business transformation programs to success. It showcases program management best practices and lessons learned though real-world case studies spanning different industry sectors and functional domains. Transforming Business with Program Management will equip executives, general managers, and program managers with the core skills necessary to effectively plan and implement business transformation strategies that drive sweeping business change and innovation.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 331,"""A timely, broadly revisionist, essential book by one of our foremost economic observers takes down one of the most cherished tenets of contemporary financial thinking: that spending less, refusing to forgive debt, and shrinking government--""austerity""--is a solution to the current economic crisis. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, too much of our conversation about economic recovery has centered on the question of debt: whether we have too much of it, when to forgive it, and how to cut the deficit. Robert Kuttner makes the most powerful argument to date that these are the wrong questions and that austerity is the wrong solution. Blending economics with historical examples of effective debt relief and punitive debt enforcement, he makes clear that universal belt-tightening, as a prescription for recession, simply defies economic logic. Just as debtor's prisons once prevented individuals from working and thus being able to pay back their debts, austerity measures shackle, rather than restore, economic growth as the weight of past debt crushes the economy's future potential. Above all, Kuttner shows how austerity serves only the interest of creditors--the very bankers and financial elites whose actions precipitated the collapse. Lucid, authoritative, provocative--a book that is certain to be widely read and much debated""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Where America Went Wrong: And How To Regain Her Democratic Ideals,John R.

Is the American government being responsive to its citizens? Are the American and world economies as strong as they could be? Are Americans as happy as they could be? Why has world opinion turned strongly against America?While the symptoms indicate there is something fundamentally wrong with America, the remedy is very specific—we have lost our democratic tradition. The question for America no longer comes down to Democrats vs. Republicans or liberals vs. conservatives or free-market libertarians vs. anti-globalists, but rather to a simple formulation of the people vs. the elites. Some might argue that such delineation might initiate a class war. Wake up! The class war has already begun.Something has gone terribly wrong in America. The bastion of democratic freedom in the world is ignoring its own democratic traditions at home and abroad, and the results are immediate and painful. World opinion of America has dropped precipitously. The world economy has stalled, especially in Africa and Latin America. Americans are consuming more and enjoying it less. The world is not at peace. It is time for Americans and members of the world community who are unhappy to stand up and raise their voices. Elites, big corporations, and special interests have had their failed day in the sun, and now it is time to return America to its people.The solution is democratic reform. Talbott shows how greater direct democracy can revitalize not just our politics, but our economy as well. Voting rights, constitutional rights, human rights, democratic institutions, a free press, civil liberties, and especially rights to assemble and speak are important not just in the world’s repressive regimes but also in America, which has seen a long erosion of these basic rights so important to her people’s prosperity and individual freedoms.America’s next great political battle won’t be fought between Democrats and Republicans: it will be fought between elitists and populists. This book begins that battle. Reviving democracy in America: Who stole our country—and how to get it back—or did we just let them take it without a fight? Failing democracy, failing economy: Why a strong American economy requires a strong democracy Corporations are not people: Ending corporate dominance in American politics Big media: Whatever happened to the free press?

Millennials have been called lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and immature, but when you push aside the stereotypes, what actually unites this generation? The short answer: They've been had. Millennials are the hardest working and most educated generation in American history. They have poured unprecedented amounts of time and money into preparing themselves for the twenty-first-century workforce. Yet they are poorer, more medicated, more precariously employed, and have less of a social safety net than their parents or grandparents. Kids These Days asks why, and answers with a radical, brilliant, data-driven analysis of the economic and cultural forces that have shaped Millennial lives. Examining broad trends like runaway student debt, the rise of the intern, mass incarceration, social media, and more, Harris shows us a generation conditioned from birth to treat their lives and their efforts-their very selves and futures-as human capital to be invested. But what happens when children raised as investments grow up? Why are young people paying such a high price to train themselves for a system that exploits them? How can Millennials change or transcend what's been made of them? Gripping, mercilessly argued, deeply informed, and moving fluidly between critical theory, political policy, and pop culture, Kids These Days will wake you up, make you angry, and change how you see your place in the world. This is essential reading-not only for Millennials, but for anyone ready to take a hard look at how we got here and where we're headed if we don't change course fast""--  ""Millennials have been stereotyped as lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and developmentally delayed. In fact, they are the hardest working and most educated generation in American history, a generation that poured unprecedented amounts of time and money into preparing themselves for the 21st century market. Yet here they are: poorer, more medicated, more precariously employed, and with less of a social safety net than their parents or even their grandparents. To find out why, Malcolm Harris, himself a Millennial, decided to conduct a meticulous, data driven analysis of the cultural, technological, and (especially) economic forces over the past 40 years that have shaped Millennial lives. What he discovered, and the sense he made of it, will change how you see yourself, your country, and our future - whether you're a Millennial or not. Examining broad trends like the professionalization of childhood, runaway student debt, the rise of the intern, mass incarceration, social media, and more, Kids These Days charts the rise of an American ethos so normalized that we forget to notice it: the treatment of children as investments, and he dares us to confront the consequences when those children grow up. Gripping, mercilessly argued, and deeply informed, Kids These Days is essential reading, not only for Millennials but for anyone ready to take a hard look at how we got here and where we're headed if we don't change course fast""--   Read more Read less",17 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Here, he weaves together elements of economics, history, politics, and human stories, revealing that societies, economies, and countries usually make concrete choices that determine their destinies. He opens up larger questions about these choices, and why countries make them or are driven to make them, and what those decisions can mean for the future of our global economy.Economic history involves forcing together disciplines that fall naturally in different directions. But Beattie has written a lively and lucid book that successfully marries the two subjects and illustrates their interdependence. In doing so, he addresses such illuminating queries as: Why are oil and diamonds more trouble than they are worth? Why did Argentina fail and the United States succeed? Why doesn't Africa grow cocaine?False Economy explains how human beings have shaped their own fates, however unknowingly, and the conditions of the countries they call home. And though it is history, it does not end with the present day. Beattie shows how decisions that are being made now-which have either absorbed or failed to absorb the lessons from economic history-will determine what happens in the future. What does economic history teach us about the present economic unrest? Who will succeed and why? And who will fail? These are questions that we cannot afford to leave unasked . . . or unanswered.

It draws on data about the experiences of Western European nations with less punitive drug policies as well as new analyses of America's experience with legal cocaine and heroin a century ago, and of America's efforts to regulate gambling, prostitution, alcohol and cigarettes. It offers projections on the likely consequences of a number of different legalization regimes and shows that the choice about how to regulate drugs involves complicated tradeoffs among goals and conflict among social groups. The book presents a sophisticated discussion of how society should deal with the uncertainty about the consequences of legal change. Finally, it explains, in terms of individual attitudes toward risk, why it is so difficult to accomplish substantial reform of drug policy in America.

Recasting India,Hindol Sengupta,business__economics,First published in 2014,/works/OL19992739W,/authors/OL1446216A/Hindol_Sengupta,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 249,"""Twenty years after India opened its economy, it faces severe economic problems, including staggering income inequality. A third of its citizens still lack adequate food, education, and basic medical services, while Mumbai businessman Mukesh Ambani lives in the most expensive home in the world, which cost over a billion dollars to build. Despite the fact that India now has a Mars mission, there are still more mobile phones than toilets in the country. In most places, such a disparity would have the locals pounding at the gates. So why no Arab Spring for India? Hindol Sengupta, senior editor of Fortune India, argues that the only thing holding it back is the explosion of local entrepreneurship across the country. While these operations are a far cry from the giant companies owned by India's ruling billionaires, they are drastically changing its politics, upending the old caste system, and creating a ""middle India"" full of unprecedented opportunity. Like Gazalla Amin whose flourishing horticulture business in the heart of Kashmir has given her the title 'lavender queen.' Or Sunil Zode, who stole the first shoes he ever wore and now drives a Mercedes, thanks to his thriving pesticide business. Sengupta shows that the true potential of India is even larger than the world perceives, since the economic miracle unfolding in its small towns and villages is not reflected in its stock markets. He reveals an India rarely seen by the larger world--the millions of ordinary, enterprising people who are redefining the world's largest democracy""--  ""The senior editor for Fortune India explains how Marketing the world's largest democracy is at risk of falling apart and what's holding it together""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They're platforms - a new business model that has quietly become the only game in town, creating vast fortunes for its founders while dominating everyone's daily life. A platform, by definition, creates value by facilitating an exchange between two or more interdependent groups. So, rather that making things, they simply connect people. The Internet today is awash in platforms - Facebook is responsible for nearly 25 percent of total Web visits, and the Google platform crash in 2013 took about 40 percent of Internet traffic with it. Representing the ten most trafficked sites in the U.S., platforms are also prominent over the globe; in China, they hold the top eight spots in web traffic rankings. The advent of mobile computing and its ubiquitous connectivity have forever altered how we interact with each other, melding the digital and physical worlds and blurring distinctions between ""offline"" and ""online."" These platform giants are expanding their influence from the digital world to the whole economy. Yet, few people truly grasp the radical structural shifts of the last ten years. In Modern Monopolies, Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson tell the definitive story of what has changed, what it means for businesses today, and how managers, entrepreneurs, and business owners can adapt and thrive in this new era.--Amazon.com.

This book shows you how to weave your business processes into hard-to-imitate strategic capabilities that distinguish you from your competition.  The book explores the impact that well-defined and carefully integrated processes have on organizational performance. Using the results of extensive research conducted among consumer, business-to-business, and services-based companies, the authors demonstrate that adopting a business process orientation (BPO) has a positive impact on the organizational culture and business performance. The resulting process oriented e-corporation is now positioned as a necessity not only to thrive but also to survive.  The old ways of conducting business are out: pushing costs and compromising quality in order to achieve the lowest possible price. The emerging paradigm focuses on the core processes. The hallmarks of a great business still include high customer relevance, internally consistent decisions about scope and value chain activities performed, value capture mechanisms, a source of differentiation and strategic control, a sound operational system, and carefully designed processes. Business Process Orientation: Gaining the E-Business Competitive Advantage shows you how to balance your functional and horizontal orientation to create and maintain a healthy organization.

Understanding such policies is an essential part of the cultural background of managers at all levels of a firm. At the same time, firms' choices have a greater impact on economic policymaking in a global economy, as the range of alternatives open to them expands. In this textbook, Professor Acocella analyses both sides of this relationship. Special emphasis is placed on current issues: in policymaking on the basis of social choice principles and the normative and positive theory of economic policy; and issues concerning the establishment of international public institutions that can match the global reach of the private institutions (markets and firms) that generate many of today's economic challenges. Broad in scope, this book is aimed at students who have completed an introductory course in both micro and macroeconomics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Neuroelectrical Brain Imaging Tools for the Study of the Efficacy of TV Advertising Stimuli and their Application to Neuromarketing,Giovanni Vecchiato,business__economics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19890441W?edition=ia%3Aneuroelectricalb00vecc,/authors/OL7575967A/Giovanni_Vecchiato,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27077035M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 136","In this book the authors describe their original research on the potential of both standard and high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) for analyzing brain activity in response to TV advertising. When engineering techniques, neuroscience concepts and marketing stimuli converge in one research field, known as neuromarketing, various theoretical and practical aspects need to be considered. The book introduces and discusses those aspects in detail, while showing several experiments performed by the authors during their attempts to measure both the cognitive activity and emotional involvement of the test subjects. In these experiments, the authors apply simultaneous EEG, galvanic skin response and heart rate monitoring, and show how significant variations of these variables can be associated with attention to, memorization or enjoyment of the presented stimuli. In particular, this book shows the central role of statistical analysis in recovering significant information on the scalp and cortical areas involved, along with variations of activity in the autonomous nervous system. From an economic and marketing perspective, the aim of this work is to promote a better understanding of how mass consumer advertising of (established) brands affects brain systems. From a neuroscience perspective, the broader goal is to provide a better understanding of both the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of affect and cognition on memory, and the neural correlates of choice and decision-making.

When a traditional structure can morph into a culturally-attuned and culturally-aligned organization, it can become superconducting: everything works better, more smoothly, faster. Malachi O'Connor and Barry Dornfeld show how to ask the big questions that point the way to renewing a culture: Who are we? What do we stand for, and what's the connection between our identity and the strategic commitments we make?"" When people in a company are uncertain of its identity, they have a hard time executing on any strategy with real passion or commitment. Who's in charge? In many organizations it's unclear who's in charge of any given initiative at any given time. The person with the title may need to cede authority to the person with greater expertise. Or the maverick leader of an innovative project team may actually have more sway than the boss. When people don't know how to determine who's in charge, or when and how to shift authority from one person to another, the uncertainty can be paralyzing. How do I lead? Senior leaders may have positional and formal authority, but find they have a difficult time attracting followers. To get people on board with their ideas and initiatives, they can no longer simply order people to follow them. Even leaders in traditional command-and-control hierarchies sense they have to move to a different leadership style, but can't fully adjust to a world of command and collaboration.

For decades, HP was admired not only for its innovative products and soaring stock price, but for its egalitarian corporate culture and father-knows-best integrity. Backfire explains how the company fell on hard times, recounts the historic decision that made Fiorina the world's top-ranking female executive, and brings to life the backlash that resulted when she tried to impose her charismatic salesmanship on the aging icon. Top BusinessWeek journalist Peter Burrows gives the dramatic blow-by-blow of Hewlett's effort to kill Fiorina's most controversial move of all, her $19 billion purchase of rival Compaq Computer. Fiorina won by a whisker, after the most expensive proxy fight in history and a dramatic lawsuit that accused the company of illegally fixing the vote. This gripping, ongoing story includes fascinating personalities and dramatic boardroom and courtroom drama.Peter Burrows (Alameda, CA) has been a technology reporter for BusinessWeek for nine years and has covered the HP saga from the start. The department editor for BusinessWeek's computer coverage, he has been the principal chronicler of Fiorina's tenure at HP, and has written three cover stories on the subject. He has also written numerous other cover stories, including looks at Steve Jobs's Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy.

An improved annual chronology of U.S. business cycles since the 1790's,Joseph H.

This paper extends that research by redating annual peaks and troughs for the entire 1796-1914 period using a single metric: Davis' (2004) annual industrial production index.  The new pre-WWI chronology alters more than 40% of the peak and troughs, and removes cycles long considered the most questionable.  An important implication of the new chronology is the lack of discernible differences in the frequency and duration of industrial cycles among the pre-Civil War, Civil War to WWI, and post-WWII periods.  Of course, my comparison between pre-WWI and post-WWII cycles is limited by its reliance on a single annual index (as opposed to many monthly series) that is less comprehensive than GDP""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Sie scheinen Praktiker wie Theoretiker derart zu faszinieren, dass ihnen für eine wirtschaftspolitische Wertung vielfach schon die Semantik genügt. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden die öffentlichen Investitionen im Kontext der Staatsausgaben untersucht, und die theoretischen Ausführungen mit einer kritischen Analyse des empirischen Befundes konfrontiert.

Amanda Sinclair offers an alternative and more realistic approach to leadership based on personal growth, drawing on Eastern philosophies.Leadership for the Disillusioned is a true gem among the avalanche of books published each year on leadership. In a very different voice, Amanda Sinclair provides us with deep insights in her search for a different type of leader she truly liberates us from the shadow side of the leader within.' - Professor Manfred Kets de Vries, Director, INSEAD Global Leadership CenterWe expect our leaders to be assertive, confident, in control. Can they, and we, live up to this? Or should leadership instead be aimed at altogether different outcomes?Amanda Sinclair, writer, professor at Australia's foremost Business School and yoga teacher, tackles these fundamental questions about leadership head on. She shows how our ideas about leadership have been captured by narrow interests and corporate templates. Challenging leadership assumptions and myths, she explores an approach to leading that is truly liberating for both leaders and those around them.Leadership for the Disillusioned is not a guide to getting to the top: it will take you on a different journey. Sinclair draws on a wide set of social ideas, including Eastern philosophies, as well as personal encounters with exceptional leaders.Leadership for the Disillusioned is for anyone who is looking for an alternative way to lead.'This is a marvellous book, one of the best I have ever read on leadership...beautifully written, clear and concise, it is also personal, experiential and empowering.' - Professor David Collinson, Lancaster University Management School'At long last, Amanda Sinclair blows open the leadership myths. This book is a must for all of us who want leadership to be about liberation and freedom.' - Rhonda Galbally, CEO, www.ourcommunity.com.auAmanda brings a philosophical skepticism to much academic writing about leadership...she has produced a book marked by honesty and self-examination.' - Professor Glyn Davis, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The authors have provided two empirical studies, using Swedish data for which unusually long data series are available. Both the empirical studies show how to analyse business cycles and to interpret them in the light of one well-established theoretical framework. The book's theoretical paper introduces readers to a different theoretical approach. The authors argue for the role played by shocks and by expectations in creating and exacerbating business cycles. As well as providing an overview of recent work in business cycle research, the book also shows how analytical techniques can be applied to historical data; it thus makes a substantial theoretical and applied contribution to the literature.

When short-term thinking is applied to economic development, especially in fragile nations, the results—corruption, waste, and faulty planning—are often disastrous. In Bringing in the Future, William Ascher draws on the latest research from psychology, economics, institutional design, and legal theory to suggest strategies to overcome powerful obstacles to long-term planning in developing countries.Drawing on cases from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Ascher applies strategies such as the creation and scheduling of tangible and intangible rewards, cognitive exercises to increase the understanding of longer-term consequences, self-restraint mechanisms to protect long-term commitments and enhance credibility, and restructuring policy-making processes to permit greater influence of long-term considerations. Featuring theoretically informed research findings and sound policy examples, this volume will assist policy makers, activists, and scholars seeking to understand how the vagaries of human behavior affect international development.

Drawing on examples from countries including Colombia, Mexico, Canada, Germany, Russia, Tanzania, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands, the chapters describe how adaptation measures are interpreted, transformed, and implemented at grassroots level and how these measures are changing or interfering with power relations, legal pluralismm and local (ecological) knowledge. As a whole, the book challenges established perspectives of climate change adaptation by taking into account issues of cultural diversity, environmental justicem and human rights, as well as feminist or intersectional approaches. This innovative approach allows for analyses of the new configurations of knowledge and power that are evolving in the name of climate change adaptation.  This volume will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate change, environmental law and policy, and environmental sociology, and to policymakers and practitioners working in the field of climate change adaptation.

He returns again and again, brings his friends and relatives, and his loyalty becomes a marketing platform of its own. But growing a loyal base is challenging, and what works brilliantly for one company might backfire on another. Over the last ten years, however, researchers and psychologists have begun to seriously measure what triggers happiness for the first time, and in this revealing look at the commercial power of positive psychology Columbia business professor Bernd Schmitt explores how marketers and brand managers can harness customer emotion through one of three approaches: The Feel Good Method: Hook customers through the experience of pleasure and positive emotions, and let those feel-good moments transform a once-in-a-blue-moon customer to a committed loyalist. The Meaningful Method: Engage customers through core values, including family, social responsibility, or the environment to attract passionate customers to your business. The Learning and Growing Method: Help your customers achieve personal growth by making your product an indispensable part of their individual development. Schmitt shows marketers and brand managers how to determine which of these best fits their company and how to turn this insight into an authentic and successful campaign that will reach, grow, and sustain a loyal base of customers.

This book examines the institutional dimension of markets and the rules and institutions that condition the operation of the market economies.Standard economics studies markets of arenas of interacting demand and supply forces. It presupposes that such interplay of economic forces takes place within a framework of rules 2 oldmediautions. Yet, the issue of how these framing rules and institutions condition the operation of markets is rarely explicitly explored. By expressly looking at markets as social institutions, the articles collected in this volume seek to fill this void. Their analytical focus is on the constitution of markets in the sense of the ""rules of the game"" within which the evolutionary process of market competition unfolds. A central theme is the systematic interplay between the nature of the consituting rules of markets and the character of the economic process emerging within these rules. Particular attention is paid to the relation between the market and the state, specifically the role of governments in shaping and maintaining the economic constitution of their societies.Researchers, professionals and students will greatly enhance their understanding of markets as a social institution by reading this book.

Then it gets harder and less fun, until it hits a low point—really hard, and not much fun at all.And then you find yourself asking if the goal is even worth the hassle. Maybe you're in a Dip—a temporary setback that will get better if you keep pushing. But maybe it's really a Cul-de-Sac, which will never get better, no matter how hard you try.According to bestselling author Seth Godin, what really sets superstars apart from everyone else is the ability to escape dead ends quickly, while staying focused and motivated when it really counts.Winners quit fast, quit often, and quit without guilt—until they commit to beating the right Dip for the right reasons. In fact, winners seek out the Dip. They realize that the bigger the barrier, the bigger the reward for getting past it. If you can become number one in your niche, you'll get more than your fair share of profits, glory, and long-term security.Losers, on the other hand, fall into two basic traps. Either they fail to stick out the Dip—they get to the moment of truth and then give up—or they never even find the right Dip to conquer.Whether you're a graphic designer, a sales rep, an athlete, or an aspiring CEO, this fun little book will help you figure out if you're in a Dip that's worthy of your time, effort, and talents. If you are, The Dip will inspire you to hang tough. If not, it will help you find the courage to quit—so you can be number one at something else.Seth Godin doesn't claim to have all the answers. But he will teach you how to ask the right questions.   Read more Read less",46 Want to read|0 Currently reading|10 Have read

They carry, along with proprietary documents and computer files, the latest in personal electronic gear. However, carefully watching most of those travelersbeginning the moment they arrive at the airport and often soonerare uncounted numbers of espionage operatives. These individuals work for foreign intelligence services and economic concerns and seek to separate international business travelers from their trade secrets. To succeed, they use many time-tested techniques to lure unsuspecting travelers into vulnerable or compromising positions.

Luke Bencie is a veteran of this struggle. He knows intimately the threats business travelers face and how to combat those threats.

Based on a representative sample of those actively involved in business creation, analysis begins with the consideration of 75 factors that may affect the decision of adults to get involved in the creation of a new business, followed by a detailed exploration of over 130 factors that may be associated with completing the start-up process with a new firm. The results indicate, first, that over ten million persons are involved in the firm start-up phase as nascent entrepreneurs. Second, the major factors associated with entry into the start-up process have little impact on completion of the process with an operating business. Third, activities pursued in the start-up process - not the characteristics of the entrepreneur, the start-up, or the location - have a major impacts on the transition from start-up to a successful new firm. There is little impact associated with being male; being White, Black or Hispanic; having more education; being wealthy; having experience with other start-ups; having an ""entrepreneurial personality""; or being in a supportive environment. This project demonstrates the value of tracking a representative sample of nascent entrepreneurs with a longitudinal study. Implications for future research, entrepreneurs, and public policy are substantial.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The concept of organizational identity has received attention in many disciplines such as strategic management, marketing, communication and public relations and organization theory. In practice a number of consultancy firms have specialized in identity management, while a number of academic conferences with a special focus on identity has developed. As globalisation of business and of organizations of all kinds become the norm rather than the exception, issues of collective identities take on a strategic importance. There has been, however, very little integration among the various disciplines and practices, resulting in conflicting definitions, and little cumulative research. The aim of Organizational Identities is to further understanding about collective identities by bringing together contributions from various management disciplines. To this end, the editors have developed an integrative framework - the five-facet framework - that allows articulation of contributions from disciplines as diverse as strategic management, organization theory, marketing and communication. Sixteen scholars from Europe and the US have contributed nine chapters that explore various aspects of collective identities using this five-facet framework. The result is the first book to bring together contributions from various fields and integrate them into a single conceptual framework. The book will be useful both for academics and for practitioners. It includes a balance of theoretical and empirical chapters, and presents original empirical data drawn from field research in a variety of settings.

The evolution of competition laws and their enforcement,Pradeep S. Mehta,business__economics,First published in 2011,/works/OL16528701W,/authors/OL1523283A/Pradeep_S._Mehta,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Routledge|Language English,"""This edited volume identifies the various country specific factors that warrant changes in the design and implementation of competition laws. The book covers case studies of nine countries of differing sizes and at varying stages of economic development, that have at one stage or another repealed extant competition laws for new ones, and seeks to examine the motivations and contexts under which this was done. The countries examined include the Czech Republic, Hungary, India, Ireland, Poland, Serbia, South Africa, Tanzania and the UK. Tracing the evolution of competition regimes in the countries covered, the book provides lessons for countries still in the process of forming their competition regimes. The contributions show that the road to strong competition regimes is seldom smooth, and that social, economic and political factors in the country hugely impact on the pace and effectiveness of competition reforms. The volume also addresses the issue of when the development of competition policies and laws can be seen to be in conflict with national development strategies. This book will be extremely useful for academics and students in the fields of global competition, law and economics, and development economics, as well as for policymakers. Pradeep S. Mehta is the founder Secretary General of Consumer Unity & Trust Society (CUTS), a leading economic policy research, advocacy and networking organisation, and serves on several policy-making bodies of the Government of India, related to trade, investment, competition, environment and consumer affairs""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With this book, your team and its members will gain a deeper understanding of how conflict emerges and how to respond in ways that will leverage conflicts to their advantage. Team members will learn the importance of establishing a safe team climate, agreeing on processes to guide interactions, and use of constructive communication skills in order to develop a conflict competent team.   As the authors say, conflict is not to be avoided, but embraced and explored. This often results in new, previously unimagined opportunities, solutions and results. The authors include stories, interviews, and examples that provide entertaining and thought provoking insights. They dedicate one chapter to techniques and processes for addressing team conflict that has gone awry. Runde and Flanagan also include useful tips and tools for assessing your team's current state of conflict competence and suggestions for addressing the challenges of today's virtual and geographically dispersed teams.

Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musks story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs.

This updated edition of a bestseller not only illustrates bad management approaches, but also covers the bad work environments and cultural traits commonly found in IT, software development, and other business domains. For each antipattern, it describes the situation and symptoms, gives examples, and offers a refactoring solution. The authors, graduate faculty at Penn State University, avoid an overly scholarly style and infuse the text with entertaining sidebars, cartoons, stories, and jokes. They provide names for the antipatterns that are visual, humorous, and memorable. Using real-world anecdotes, they illustrate key concepts in an engaging manner. This updated edition sheds light on new management and environmental antipattems and includes a new chapter, six updated chapters, and new discussion questions. Topics covered include leadership principles, environmental antipatterns, group patterns, management antipatterns, and team leadership.Following introductory material on management theory and human behavior, the text catalogs the full range of management, cultural, and environmental antipatterns. It includes thought-provoking exercises that each describe a situation, ask which antipatterns are present, and explain how to refactor the situation. It provides time-tested advice to help you overcome bad practices through successful interaction with your clients, customers, peers, supervisors, and subordinates. ""--  ""Preface In troubled organizations, a frequent obstacle to success is accurate problem identification. When problems are incorrectly diagnosed by management or by the consultants they hire, then correction of the problem is rarely possible. Conversely, when problems are correctly identified, they can almost always be dealt with appropriately. Unfortunately, organizational inertia frequently clouds the situation or makes it easier to do the wrong thing rather than the right thing. So how can one know what the right thing is if one has the problem wrong? This is where antipatterns can be helpful. Shortly after the emergence of patterns*, practitioners began discussing problem- solution pairs in which the conventional solution does more harm than good, known as ""antipatterns."" In their groundbreaking work, AntiPatterns, Brown, Malveaux, McCormick, and Mowbray (1998) described a taxonomy of problems that can occur in software engineering. They also described solutions or refactorings for these situations. The benefit of providing such a taxonomy is that it assists in the rapid and correct identification of problem situations, provides a playbook for addressing the problems, and provides some relief to the participants who can take consolation in the fact that they are not alone. Brown et al. organized their antipatterns into three general types: (1) architectural, (2) design, and (3) management. The architectural patterns describe bad practices that lead to unacceptable software architectures (for example, ""Kitchen Sink""). The design antipatterns do the same for design (everyone knows about ""Design by Committee""). The management antipatterns generally describe dysfunctional behavior of individual managers, or pervasive management practices that inhibit success""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Do you strive for higher income, but at the same time sense there's more to success than making lots of money? Do you long to pursue your purpose in a meaningful and rewarding way? Even though you've already achieved a great deal, do you deeply desire, definitely deserve, and fully expect to reap even greater financial rewards--and want to ensure you handle those financial rewards knowledgably and responsibly?  Sacred Success is a groundbreaking paradigm shift that tells women, There is a better way to achieve wealth and power: on your own terms.  In her work with countless powerful, successful women over the last twenty years, bestselling author and financial educator Barbara Stanny found that most women's problems with money have little to do with money itself, but rather their fear of or ambivalence toward power. Instead of pushing women to pursue financial success in the traditional fashion, Sacred Success seeks to redefine power from a feminine perspective.  You can be financially successful without sacrificing your soul or compromising your values. You can have more money, not as an end itself, but as a tool for making a difference and helping others. You can create wealth and exercise power by staying true to your feminine traits, authentic truths, and personal mission.  The ultimate goal of Sacred Success isn't to ""finish rich"" (though that may be a desired outcome), but to achieve Greatness, which requires you to become the powerful force you were born to be.  More than a financial guide, Sacred Success is a primer on power for women--a tutorial for taking charge of your life by taking charge of your finances, and not only growing your money but creating a deeper, richer, and more meaningful life. Best described as A Course in Miracles meets the Wall Street Journal, Sacred Success gives you a proven process that uniquely blends the practical, psychological, and spiritual work of wealth.  The results may be nothing short of miraculous""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

What happened at Lehman Brothers and why was it allowed to fail, with aftershocks that rocked the global economy? In this news-making, often astonishing book, a former Lehman Brothers Vice President gives us the straight answers--right from the belly of the beast.In A Colossal Failure of Common Sense, Larry McDonald, a Wall Street insider, reveals, the culture and unspoken rules of the game like no book has ever done. The book is couched in the very human story of Larry McDonald's Horatio Alger-like rise from a Massachusetts ""gateway to nowhere"" housing project to the New York headquarters of Lehman Brothers, home of one of the world's toughest trading floors.We get a close-up view of the participants in the Lehman collapse, especially those who saw it coming with a helpless, angry certainty. We meet the Brahmins at the top, whose reckless, pedal-to-the-floor addiction to growth finally demolished the nation's oldest investment bank. The Wall Street we encounter here is a ruthless place, where brilliance, arrogance, ambition, greed, capacity for relentless toil, and other human traits combine in a potent mix that sometimes fuels prosperity but occasionally destroys it.The full significance of the dissolution of Lehman Brothers remains to be measured. But this much is certain: it was a devastating blow to America's--and the world's--financial system. And it need not have happened. This is the story of why it did.From the Hardcover edition.

Internet based technologies, particularly interorganizational systems, further extend the firms’ opportunities to strengthen their supply chain partnerships and share real-time information to optimize their operations.  Supply Chain Collaboration: Roles of Interorganizational Systems, Trust, and Collaborative Culture explores the nature and characteristics, antecedents, and consequences of supply chain collaboration from multiple theoretical perspectives.  Supply Chain Collaboration: Roles of Interorganizational Systems, Trust, and Collaborative Culture conceptualizes supply chain collaboration as seven interconnecting elements including information sharing, incentive alignment, goal congruence, decision synchronization, resource sharing, as well as communication and joint knowledge creation. These seven components define the occurrence of collaborative efforts and allow us to explain supply chain collaboration more precisely. Collaborative advantages are also divided into five components to capture the joint competitive advantages and benefits among supply chain partners. The definitions and measures developed here examine some central issue surrounding supply chain development but this is also followed up with real-life managerial practicalities. This balance of theory and practical application makes Supply Chain Collaboration: Roles of Interorganizational Systems, Trust, and Collaborative Culture a strong resource for industry practitioners and researchers alike.

This book addresses rampage shootings in Western Europe and their conditional impact on politicization and policy change in the area of gun control.  The author sets out to unravel the factors that facilitate or impede the access of gun control to the political agenda in the wake of rampage shootings and analyses why some political debates lead to profound shifts of the policy status quo, while others peter out without any legislative reactions. In so doing, the book not only contributes to the theoretical literature on crisis-induced policy making, but also provides a wealth of case-study evidence on rampage shootings as empirical phenomena.

The other half is taking care of the business-tracking expenses, being profitable, filing taxes, and meeting government requirements. This resource covers everything family child care providers need to keep accurate business records. If a family child care provider pays close attention to the recommendations in this book, he or she will be able to claim the maximum allowable deductions and pay the lowest possible federal taxes.Since the previous edition of Family Child Care Record-Keeping Guide, congress and the IRS have made many changes to tax rules that affect family child care providers. There have been changes in depreciation rules, adjustments to food and mileage rates, and clarifications on how to calculate the Time-Space percentage. Author Tom Copeland has been involved in many IRS audits and represented providers in several Tax Court cases that have also clarified numerous rules. Further necessitating this ninth edition, the IRS issued two significant new rules in 2013. These updates, new rules, and clarifications are detailed in this book; all of the information is applicable to child care providers in every state, regardless of local regulations.Tom Copeland, JD, is a writer, trainer, lawyer, and consultant focusing on family child care business issues. He has conducted record-keeping, tax preparation, and business workshops for family child care providers across the country since 1981""--  ""This resource covers everything you need to keep accurate business records and save money on your taxes.

The wide range of reactions to the efforts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Sarah Palin dramatically reflected ongoing conflicts over diversity in our society, especially in the venue where people are most likely to encounter them: work. As more and more people who aren't white men enter corporate America, we urgently need to learn how to avoid clashes over these issues and how to resolve them when they do occur.Thomas Kochman and Jean Mavrelis have been helping corporations successfully do that for over twenty years. Their diversity training and consulting firm has helped managers and employees at numerous companies recognize and overcome the cultural bases of miscommunication between ethnic groups and across gender lines—and in Corporate Tribalism they seek to share their expertise with the world. In the first half of the book, Kochman addresses white men, explicating the ways that their cultural background can motivate their behavior, work style, and perspective on others. Then Mavrelis turns to white women, focusing on the particular problems they face, including conflicts with men, other women, and themselves. Together they emphasize the need for a multicultural—rather than homogenizing—approach and offer constructive ideas for turning the workplace into a more interactive community for everyone who works there. Written with the wisdom and clarity gained from two decades of hands-on work, Corporate Tribalism will be an invaluable resource as we look toward a future beyond the glass ceiling.
