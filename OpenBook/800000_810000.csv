Prioritering og progresjon i skolematematikken,Torgeir Onstad,mathematics,First published in 2017,/works/OL23501126W,/authors/OL8011995A/Torgeir_Onstad,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Cappelen Damm Akademisk/NOASP (Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing)|Pages 318,"Norway is a leading country in the world when it comes to not prioritizing algebra in school mathematics, the mathematical language many students will need for further education and professions. Analysis of data from TIMSS, TIMSS Advanced and other international comparative studies have concluded that this result is consistent across 20 years of research. Norwegian students perform well in domains such as statistics/data, and alarmingly low in algebra. This conclusion is based on data from all levels in school: Primary school, lower secondary school, upper secondary school, and teacher education. The international studies indicate that East Asian, Eastern European and Latin European countries prioritize algebra more strongly than Norway or other Nordic and English-speaking countries. Several of the countries performing well in algebra, also seem to have some sort of balance between teaching algebra and teaching statistics, while there is a huge difference between the student scores on these domains in Norway. It almost seems as though “students learn statistics instead of learning algebra”. The importance of taking into account the type of mathematical content which is tested in different studies before drawing conclusions, is also addressed in the book. For instance, PISA mathematics is compared to TIMSS grade 8 mathematics when it comes to mathematical theory involvement. On the other hand, it is emphasized that it is necessary to have information from different studies to make valid conclusions concerning mathematics in schools. The importance of cooperation between countries all over the world in developing school mathematics, with countries learning from each other, is also discussed. The book is a result of cooperation between researchers at the Department of teacher education and school research (ILS) and the Department of mathematics, both at the University of Oslo, and school teachers in an upper secondary school. The results are discussed from a teacher education perspective, a school teacher perspective and from the perspective of the national curriculum for schools in Norway. Some of the chapters in the book are devoted to going through all the test items in TIMSS Advanced 2015 which can be published, and it is described how these items can be used both by teachers in school and in teacher education at universities.  ""Denne boka presenterer forskningsresultater om matematikk på alle nivåer i skolen (barneskole, ungdomsskole, videregående skole) over de siste 20 årene. Norge har deltatt i internasjonale komparative studier fra 1995 til 2015 i regi av IEA (TIMSS Advanced, TIMSS, TEDS-M) og OECD (PISA). De fleste av disse studiene gjennomføres nå med jevne mellomrom. Sentrale forskningsspørsmål for boka er: -Hvilke konsistente forskningsresultater for skolematematikk finner vi, basert på data over 20 år fra alle disse studiene?  -Hvilke utfordringer har norsk skole hvis elevene skal få den matematiske basiskunnskapen de trenger for videre utdanninger og yrker?  Hvordan resultatene fra disse studiene kan bidra til bedre undervisning i skolen, og til å lette overgangen fra videregående skole til høyere utdanning for elevene, står sentralt i boka. Disse problemstillingene er noe av bakgrunnen for samarbeidet om boka mellom Institutt for lærerutdanning og skoleforskning (ILS), Universitetet i Oslo; Lillestrøm videregående skole i Akershus; Matematisk institutt, Universitetet i Oslo; og Matematikksenteret, NTNU i Trondheim.""

Global Analysis on Foliated Spaces,Calvin C Moore,mathematics,First published in 2001,/works/OL15175331W,/authors/OL6814450A/Calvin_C_Moore,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24307080M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"Foliated spaces look locally like products, but their global structure is generally not a product, and tangential differential operators are correspondingly more complex.  In the 1980s, Alain Connes founded what is now known as noncommutative geometry and topology. One of the first results was his generalization of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem to compute the analytic index associated with a tangential (pseudo) - differential operator and an invariant transverse measure on a foliated manifold, in terms of topological data on the manifold and the operator. This second edition presents a complete proof of this beautiful result, generalized to foliated spaces (not just manifolds). It includes the necessary background from analysis, geometry, and topology.  The present edition has improved exposition, an updated bibliography, an index, and additional material covering developments and applications since the first edition came out, including the confirmation of the Gap Labeling Conjecture of Jean Bellissard.

To illustrate these methods, the authors employ several data sets throughout that cover a range of study designs, variable types, and missing data issues. The book first reviews modern approaches to formulate and interpret regression models for longitudinal data. It then discusses key ideas in Bayesian inference, including specifying prior distributions, computing posterior distribution, and assessing model fit. The book carefully describes the assumptions needed to make inferences about a full-data distribution from incompletely observed data. For settings with ignorable dropout, it emphasizes the importance of covariance models for inference about the mean while for nonignorable dropout, the book studies a variety of models in detail. It concludes with three case studies that highlight important features of the Bayesian approach for handling nonignorable missingness. With suggestions for further reading at the end of most chapters as well as many applications to the health sciences, this resource offers a unified Bayesian approach to handle missing data in longitudinal studies.

However, this approach is being superseded by developments in international accounting and solvency standards coupled with other advances enabling a market-based valuation of risk, i.e., its price if traded in a free market. The book describes these new approaches, and is the first to explain them in conjunction with more traditional methods. The various chapters address specific aspects of market-based valuation. The exposition integrates methods and results from financial and insurance mathematics, and is based on the entries in a life insurance company's market accounting scheme. The book will be of great interest and use to students and practitioners who need an introduction to this area, and who seek a practical yet sound guide to life insurance accounting and product development.

Lectures on advanced mathematical methods for physicists,Sunil Mukhi,mathematics,First published in 2010,/works/OL16679355W?edition=ia%3Alecturesonadvanc00mukh_394,/authors/OL7142330A/Sunil_Mukhi,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25353424M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  World Scientific|Language English|Pages 278,"This book presents a survey of Topology and Differential Geometry and also, Lie Groups and Algebras, and their Representations. The first topic is indispensable to students of gravitation and related areas of modern physics (including string theory), while the second has applications in gauge theory and particle physics, integrable systems and nuclear physics.  Part I provides a simple introduction to basic topology, followed by a survey of homotopy. Calculus of differentiable manifolds is then developed, and a Riemannian metric is introduced along with the key concepts of connections and curvature. The final chapters lay out the basic notions of simplicial homology and de Rham cohomology as well as fibre bundles, particularly tangent and cotangent bundles.  Part II starts with a review of group theory, followed by the basics of representation theory. A thorough description of Lie groups and algebras is presented with their structure constants and linear representations. Root systems and their classifications are detailed, and this section of the book concludes with the description of representations of simple Lie algebras, emphasizing spinor representations of orthogonal and pseudo-orthogonal groups.  The style of presentation is succinct and precise. Involved mathematical proofs that are not of primary importance to physics student are omitted. The book aims to provide the reader access to a wide variety of sources in the current literature, in addition to being a textbook of advanced mathematical methods for physicists. --Book Jacket.

Its goal is to provide a doctrinal basis for mathematics. This provides a firm foundation for each branch of mathematics in contrast to the false philosophies of mathematics which promote science, logic, math itself, or the human mind as the basis for mathematics. With these false philosophies so prevalent in schools across America, it is important to know and teach the true foundation. The book is inspired by Henry Morris, who did a similar book for the sciences entitled The Biblical Basis of Modern Science. - Publisher.

Then H has rank n. We derive a generalized Takagi singular value problem defined by two n x n matrices, such that its n generalized Takagi singular values are the positive singular values of H. If rho is real, then the generalized Takagi singular value problem reduces to a generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem. The computations can be carried out so that the Lanczos method applied to the latter problem requires only 0(n log n) arithmetic operations for each iteration. If pi and chi are given in power form, then the elements of all n x n matrices required can be determined in 0(sq.n) arithmetic operations.

The authors present this topic from the perspective of linear representations of finite-oriented graphs (quivers) and homological algebra. The self-contained treatment constitutes an elementary, up-to-date introduction to the subject using, on the one hand, quiver-theoretical techniques and, on the other, tilting theory and integral quadratic forms. Key features include many illustrative examples, plus a large number of end-of-chapter exercises. The detailed proofs make this work suitable both for courses and seminars, and for self-study. The volume will be of great interest to graduate students beginning research in the representation theory of algebras and to mathematicians from other fields.

Heavy-traffic analysis of multi-type queueing under probabilistically load-preferential service order,Donald Paul Gaver,mathematics,First published in 1990,/works/OL16888884W?edition=ia%3Aheavytrafficanal00gave,/authors/OL7176183A/Donald_Paul_Gaver,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25510197M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1990|Publisher  Naval Postgraduate School,              Available from National Technical Information Service|Language English","A model of queueing for a single server by several types of customers (messages, or jobs),      with a simple dynamic priority rule, is considered. The rule is equivalent to selecting the next      server occupant type with a probability proportional to the number of that type enqueued.      The situation studied here occurs in fields such as computer and communication system      performance analysis, in operational analysis of logistics systems, and in the repair of      elements of a manufacturing system. It is assumed that the population sizes of the items of      different types are large, and that the mean service rates are correspondingly large, in      comparison with the service demand rates. Moreover, it is assumed that the system is in      heavy traffic. Under these assumptions, asymptotic approximations are derived for the      steady-state means and covariances of the number of items of different types either waiting      or being served. Numerical comparisons with simulated results show excellent agreement.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wall wrote Creative Mathematics with the intention of leading students to develop their mathematical abilities, helping them learn the art of mathematics, and teaching them to create mathematical ideas. Creative Mathematics, according to Wall, ""is not a compendium of mathematical facts and inventions to be read over as a connoisseur of art looks over paintings. It is, instead, a sketchbook in which readers try their hands at mathematical discovery."" The book is self-contained and assumes little formal mathematical background on the part of the reader. Wall is earnest about developing mathematical creativity and independence in students. Wall developed Creative Mathematics over a period of many years of working with students at the University of Texas at Austin. In fewer than 200 pages, he takes the reader on a stimulating tour starting with numbers and then moving on to simple graphs, the integral, simple surfaces, successive approximations, linear spaces of simple graphs, and concluding with mechanical systems. The student who has worked through Creative Mathematics will come away with heightened mathematical maturity.""--P. [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Destinado, en principio, a estudiantes de las ingenierías informáticas, los contenidos se estructuran en tres grandes bloques: una primera parte, capítulos 1 al 4, dedicada al estudio de la parte discreta del cálculo, es decir, las sucesiones y las series numéricas; una parte central, capítulos 5 al 9, con el estudio del cálculo diferencial de funciones de varias variables reales; y una parte final, capítulos 11 y 12, dedicada al estudio del cálculo integral en una y varias variables. Queda claro en estos contenidos que el cálculo diferencial de funciones de una variable real es prerrequisito imprescindible para abordar la lectura de este volumen.  Los capítulos que conforman el manual, siguen una estructura de introducción de conceptos teóricos con ejemplos resueltos de aplicación, donde el estudiante pueda y, seguramente, deba observar la metodología empleada en su resolución y cuestionarse el porqué de dicha metodología, como base para su aprendizaje. Posteriormente, se presenta algunos ejercicios adicionales para que el alumno pueda practicar la metodología aprendida y profundizar en el conocimiento de las nociones desarrolladas. También se incluye, al final de cada capítulo, algunos ejercicios adicionales de dificultad variable destinados tanto a reforzar lo aprendido, como a estimular la búsqueda de soluciones alternativas.

In this book, the reader is expected to do more than read the book and is expected to study the material in the book by working out examples rather than just reading about them. So this book is not just about mathematical content but is also about the process of learning and doing mathematics. Along the way, you will also learn some important mathematical topics that will help you in your future study of mathematics.  This book is designed not to be just casually read but rather to be engaged. It may seem like a clich´e (because it is in almost every mathematics book now) but there is truth in the statement that mathematics is not a spectator sport. To learn and understand mathematics, you must engage in the process of doing mathematics. So you must actively read and study the book, which means to have a pencil and paper with you and be willing to follow along and fill in missing details. This type of engagement is not easy and is often frustrating, but if you do so, you will learn a great deal about mathematics and more importantly, about doing mathematics.  Recognizing that actively studying a mathematics book is often not easy, several features of the textbook have been designed to help you become more engaged as you study the material.

The presentation is lively and up to date, paying particular emphasis to developing an appreciation of underlying mathematical theory. Beginning with basic definitions, properties and derivations of some basic equations of mathematical physics from basic principles, the book studies first order equations, classification of second order equations, and the one-dimensional wave equation. Two chapters are devoted to the separation of variables, whilst others concentrate on a wide range of topics including elliptic theory, Green's functions, variational and numerical methods. A rich collection of worked examples and exercises accompany the text, along with a large number of illustrations and graphs to provide insight into the numerical examples. Solutions to selected exercises are included for students whilst extended solution sets are available to lecturers from solutions@cambridge.org.

Statistical Analysis of Stochastic Processes in Time,J.

Much theoretical work has been done but virtually no modern books are available to show how the results can be applied. This book fills that gap by introducing practical methods of applying stochastic processes to an audience knowledgeable only in basic statistics. It covers almost all aspects of the subject and presents the theory in an easily accessible form that is highlighted by application to many examples. These examples arise from dozens of areas, from sociology through medicine to engineering. Complementing these are exercise sets making the book suited for introductory courses in stochastic processes. Software (available from www.cambridge.org) is provided  for the freely available R system for the reader to apply to all the models presented.

Mathematics was enjoyed as a form of entertainment by adults and children alike and by people of all social classes. Jinkōki, an extraordinary mathematics textbook, was used at private elementary schools called terakoya and became a bestseller that could be found in every household. Furthermore, world-class works were produced by Japanese mathematicians such as Seki Takakazu and Takebe Katahiro. This book explores the beauty and fascination surrounding wasan by providing a guided tour that goes back in time over three hundred years and navigates through the mysterious and incredible world of mathematical wizardry found during the Edo period in Japan""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die ersten vier Kapitel beinhalten eine vergleichsweise einfach gehaltene Einführung in die Funktionentheorie einer komplexen Veränderlichen und gipfeln im Beweis des kleinen Riemannschen Abbildungssatzes und einer Charakterisierung einfach zusammenhängender Gebiete. Weitere behandelte Themen sind: - die Theorie der elliptischen Funktionen nach dem Vorbild von K. Weierstraß. (Mit einem Exkurs über den älteren Zugang (N.H. Abel, C.G.F. Jacobi) über die Thetafunktionen); - eine systematische Weiterführung der Theorie der Modulfunktionen und Modulformen; - Anwendungen der Funktionentheorie auf die ana lytische Zahlentheorie; - der Beweis des Primzahlsatzes mit einer schwachen Form des Restgliedes. Sachbezogene Motivation, außergewöhnlich viele Übungsaufgaben in jedem Kapitel, historische Anmerkungen und zahlreiche Abbildungen machen die Darstellung besonders attraktiv. Die Strukturierung des Textes in Kapitelzusammenfassungen und besondere Hervorhebungen erleichtern dem Leser die Orientierung und machen dieses Lehrbuch auch zum Selbststudium und zur Prüfungsvorbereitung gut geeignet.

This notion was defined in 1991 by Dubrovin, motivated by physics results. Another source of Frobenius manifolds is singularity theory. Duality between string theories lies behind the phenomenon of mirror symmetry. One mathematical formulation can be given in terms of the isomorphism of certain Frobenius manifolds. A third source of Frobenius manifolds is given by integrable systems, more precisely, bihamiltonian hierarchies of evolutionary PDE's. As in the case of quantum cohomology, here Frobenius manifolds are part of an a priori much richer structure, which, because of strong constraints, can be determined implicitly by the underlying Frobenius manifolds. Quantum cohomology, the theory of Frobenius manifolds and the relations to integrable systems are flourishing areas since the early 90's. An activity was organized at the Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics in 2002, with the purpose of bringing together the main experts in these areas. This volume originates from this activity and presents the state of the art in the subject.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A partir de esta primera idea, comenzamos a realizar algunos trabajos de investigación sobre las ecuaciones escalares no lineales como paso previo al estudio de la resolución de operadores no lineales en espacios de Banach, que era nuestro principal objetivo.

Large Scale Inverse Problems,,mathematics,,/works/OL20927843W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  De Gruyter|Language English,"This book is thesecond volume of a three volume series recording the ""Radon Special Semester 2011 on Multiscale Simulation &amp Analysis in Energy and the Environment"" that took placein Linz, Austria, October 3-7, 2011. This volume addresses the common ground in the mathematical and computational procedures required for large-scale inverse problems and data assimilation in forefront applications. The solution of inverse problems is fundamental to a wide variety of applications such as weather forecasting, medical tomography, and oil exploration. Regularisation techniques are needed to ensure solutions of sufficient quality to be useful, and soundly theoretically based. This book addresses the common techniques required for all the applications, and is thus truly interdisciplinary. This collection of survey articles focusses on the large inverse problems commonly arising in simulation and forecasting in the earth sciences.

The Essence of Mathematics Through Elementary Problems,Alexandre Borovik,mathematics,,/works/OL20927624W,/authors/OL585698A/Alexandre_Borovik,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 389,"""It is increasingly clear that the shapes of reality ? whether of the natural world, or of the built environment ? are in some profound sense mathematical. Therefore it would benefit students and educated adults to understand what makes mathematics itself ?tick?, and to appreciate why its shapes, patterns and formulae provide us with precisely the language we need to make sense of the world around us. The second part of this challenge may require some specialist experience, but the authors of this book concentrate on the first part, and explore the extent to which elementary mathematics allows us all to understand something of the nature of mathematics from the inside.  The Essence of Mathematics consists of a sequence of 270 problems ? with commentary and full solutions. The reader is assumed to have a reasonable grasp of school mathematics. More importantly, s/he should want to understand something of mathematics beyond the classroom, and be willing to engage with (and to reflect upon) challenging problems that highlight the essence of the discipline.  The book consists of six chapters of increasing sophistication (Mental Skills; Arithmetic; Word Problems; Algebra; Geometry; Infinity), with interleaved commentary. The content will appeal to students considering further study of mathematics at university, teachers of mathematics at age 14-18, and anyone who wants to see what this kind of elementary content has to tell us about how mathematics really works.""

The author shows how alternatives to Euclid's fifth postulate lead to interesting and different patterns and symmetries. In the process of examining geometric objects, the author incorporates the algebra of complex (and hypercomplex) numbers, some graph theory, and some topology. Nevertheless, the book has only mild prerequisites. Readers are assumed to have had a course in Euclidean geometry (including some analytic geometry and some algebra) at the high school level. While many concepts introduced are advanced, the mathematical techniques are not. Singer's lively exposition and off-beat approach will greatly appeal both to students and mathematicians. Interesting problems are nicely scattered throughout the text. The contents of the book can be covered in a one-semester course, perhaps as a sequel to a Euclidean geometry course.
