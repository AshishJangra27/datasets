He also began to understand that human beings seem to have an order in their lives that closely follows the patterns of nature. This realization inspired Prof. Chadha to record and show the similarity between man-made patterns and those found in nature -- and this, in turn, was the raison d'être for this beautiful book.""--Author's web site.

The first approach focuses on the content and implementation in the public space of the popular and politicised form of street theatre, Taziyeh. The second explores the secretive world of the Sufis and their difficulties within the current political policy. These seeming opposites share common ground in Iranian collective memory via social and spiritual resistance. Reflections on religion, private and public, transparency and control, are mediated through a series of images, from which the social potential of secular mysticism emerges.

Autofocus and built-in light meters generally fail at night. Long exposures tend to make noisy or blurry photographs. Cameras set to automatic generally trigger the built-in flash in low light conditions, which results in unsatisfying images. Lack of understanding and inappropriate techniques often ruin the dramatic potential of nighttime images.  In Digital Capture After Dark you will learn to overcome these and other obstacles. You will go beyond the many ""how-to's"" of capturing digital images at night to the ""why-to's"" of long exposure photography; including the importance of how we think and see at night compared to during the day.

Small-format Aerial Photography (SFAP) presents basic and advanced principles and techniques with an emphasis on digital cameras. Unmanned platforms are described in considerable detail, including kites, helium and hot-air blimps, model airplanes, and paragliders. Several case studies, primarily drawn from the geosciences, are presented to demonstrate how SFAP is actually used in various applications. Many of these integrate SFAP with ground-based investigations as well as conventional large-format aerial photography, satellite imagery, and other kinds of geographic information. Full-color photographs throughout Case studies from around the globe Techniques presented allow for image resolution impossible to match via traditional aerial photography or satellite datasets Glossary clarifies key terms.

The digital zone system,Robert Fisher,photography,First published in 2012,/works/OL16694528W,/authors/OL7148498A/Robert_Fisher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Language English,"""There is an ongoing debate among photographers whether digital photography processes will ever be able to reach the pinnacle of image quality and tonality achieved by Ansel Adams decades ago. The Digital Zone System (DZS) is an innovative methodology for editing digital images that mimics the Zone System created by Adams.  With this book, author Robert Fisher presents a practical guide for editing digital images with a level of control previously unattainable without significant manual work. He walks the reader through the background of Adam's original Zone System and points out similarities to current digital processes including Expose to the Right (ETTR) and high dynamic range imaging (HDRI).  Learn to use luminance masks to separate an image into ""one-stop"" zones of brightness, similar to the zones in Adams's Zone System, that can be worked on individually or in groups. This makes the DZS a powerful tool for converting color images to black and white. You will also gain tremendous control over how color is adjusted in your images by learning to isolate and adjust color in specific targeted areas. These DZS processes are quicker and simpler than the tedious work of using global adjustments and painting in layer masks to isolate the effects of an adjustment layer.  In this book, you will learn how to use the Digital Zone System for editing color images, converting images to black and white, and tone mapping HDR images. Also included are brief discussions of color management, setting up Photoshop, printing, and exposure for digital images.  The book is richly illustrated with step-by-step screenshots and stunning example images that show the benefits of the Digital Zone System over commonly used digital editing methods.

I?m lucky to have met all these people or even call them friends. They are all part of the semi-organized chaos that gives NYC that magical feeling, the sense of community that makes large cities so special. I always took street photos here and there over the years, then when Maia and I had our son I would push him around in the stroller and bump into people. I would ask them if I could take their portraits and soon the series became what is now called ?Street Lords?. On the streets we are open, in motion, we are ever-changing. One thing that I love about these images is the vibe you can capture when you only take one or two frames, the background or lighting or any of that photography type stuff matters less, but you still end up capturing something intimate. This is my love letter to NYC, as well as many other cities I?ve loved over the years. And to you guys. Thanks. ? XO Peter.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The protagonists open up for the photographer, revealing unadorned and intimate images. For the book and especially for individual pictures, Markus Binder, the legendary drummer and copywriter of the duo ""Attwenger"", contributed lyrics that bring up the stories behind the pictures and add a striking literary dimension to the book.

Francesca Woodman,Chris Townsend,photography,First published in 2006,/works/OL2228950W,/authors/OL287210A/Chris_Townsend,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Phaidon|Language English|Pages 254,"""Francesca Woodman has become one of the most talked about, studied and influential of late twentieth-century photographers. She started taking photographs when she was barely thirteen, and in less than a decade created a body of work that has now secured her reputation as one of the most original American artists of the 1970s. Woodman brought an understanding of Baroque painting, modernist art and contemporary post-Minimalist practice to her haunting, sensual, images. Both in her work with models and in her sometimes disturbing self-portraits, she made a thoroughgoing challenge to the certainties of photography."" ""Interested in how people relate to space, and how the three-dimensional world can be reconciled with the two dimensions of the photographic image, Woodman played complex games of hide-and-seek with her camera. One of the enduring appeals of her work is the way in which she constructs enigmas that trap our gaze. She depicts herself seemingly fading into a flat plane, merging with a wall under the wallpaper, dissolving into the floor, or flattening herself behind glass. She constantly compares the fragility of her own body with the physical environment around her. Fascinated by transformation and the permeability of seemingly fixed boundaries, Woodman conjures in her work the precarious moment between adolescence and adulthood, between presence and absence."" ""This comprehensive monograph includes over 200 of Woodman's works - some of which have never been exhibited or published before - as well as previously unseen extracts from her journals, selected and introduced by her father, George Woodman. There are examples of her large-scale 'blue-prints', and reproductions of her artist's books, including Some Disordered Interior Geometries, which was published in 1981, the year she took her own life. An extensive text by Chris Townsend examines the influences of Gothic literature, Surrealism, feminism and post-Minimalist art on Woodman's photographs, as well as placing her in relation to her contemporaries, such as Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince. This book confirms Woodman's position as one of America's most talented and important artists since 1970, with a legacy lasting well beyond her own time.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Working in the still life tradition of Chardin, Cezanne, and the Dutch masters, as well as such contemporary photographers as Laura Letinsky and Jan Groover, he photographed every day over the course of five weeks. Unlike those forebears, Cole left his arrangements entirely to chance, the bowls and plates moving in their unpredictable constellations. What emerges is a portrait, across time, of one kitchen counter in one home at a time of social, cultural, and political upheaval. Alongside the photographs is a long written essay, as wide-ranging in its concerns--hunger, fasting, mourning, slavery, intimacy, painting, poetry and the history of photography--as the photographs are delimited in theirs. The text and photographic sequences are interspersed with an anonymous handwritten eighteenth century cookbook from Cambridge.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die Berichte über die Greueltaten der War Lords und ihrer Milizen gingen um die Welt. Andreas Herzau hat den Bürgerkrieg und die Flüchtlingsbewegungen damals vor Ort als Reporter erlebt und dokumentiert. Als in den Jahren 2005/06 ein erstaunlicher Aufarbeitungs- und Demokratisierungsprozess in Liberia einsetzte, besuchte er das Land erneut, stellte bald aber fest, dass diese Geschehnisse in der westlichen Welt auf weit weniger Interesse stießen als die 'Sensationen des Negativen'.0Ihm wurde deutlich, wie sehr das europäische Bild von Afrika durch den Fokus auf Kriege und Krisen geprägt ist. Sobald sich die Situation in einem der Länder zum Guten wendet, berichtet niemand mehr darüber. Bestand haben einzig die Bilder und Nachrichten von Greueltaten, Chaos, Hunger und Opfern. Herzau bemerkte, dass diese 'déformation professionelle' auch seinen Blick bestimmte. Er beschloss daraufhin, ein Experiment zu wagen und das Land 2019 unter anderen Vorzeichen zu betrachten. Das Ziel war, in Erfahrung zu bringen, ob es ihm gelinge, Liberia mit einem Interesse am Positiven zu bereisen und eine optische Sprache dafür zu finden. Das vorliegenden Buch stellt im Wortsinn einen Versuch dar, sich der zementierenden Wirkung einseitiger Opferberichterstattung entgegenzustellen und dem Stereotyp des europäischen Afrikabildes zu entkommen. Inspiration dafür war auch der Essay 'How to write about Africa' des kenianischen Autors Binyavanga Wainaina, der dem Band in Deutsch und Englisch vorangestellt ist.

Havet, de milde bakker, gadekær og vejsving er ydmyge, tyste motiver, der ikke gør megen væsen af sig. Alligevel sitrer Ulrik Møllers malerier af stemning og nærvær. Han skildrer verden minutiøst, næsten sirligt på trods af de ofte slørede konturer. De mennesketomme landskaber skaber en særlig oplevelse af nærvær og forladthed på samme tid, og vi rammes af en indre stilhed, når vi ser på billederne.

Als Flaneur mit einer allzeit bereiten Kamera blickte er hinter die Kulissen eines müde und mürbe gewordenen Staates und entdeckte dabei immer wieder Szenen im alltäglichen ƯLeben der Berliner mit einer überraschenden Mischung aus Heiterkeit und Melancholie. Ab 1986 fotografierte Hauswald auch in Farbe, von westdeutschen Illustrierten grosszügig ausgestattet mit hochwertigen Kodak-Filmen. So entstanden neben seinen klassisch gewordenen Schwarzweiss-Bildern nun auch Aufnahmen, die das 'Abendlicht' über einer untergehenden Gesellschaft, aber auch den farbenfrohen Aufbruch einer jungen Generation festhielten, still, unspektakulär, aber von umso grösserer Suggestivkraft.

Minolta system handbook,Joseph D.

Overflowing with data, explanations, ideas, and illustrations, each of these two volumes outlines the many facets of the Minolta System that account for its popularity among today's photographers.  What distinguishes this handbook from other camera manuals are many unique features, including:  • Its thorough coverage of the specifications and use of the latest Minolta cameras and their many accessories.  • Its lens directory section, which in itself is worth the price of the entire handbook, for nowhere is so much data on Minolta lenses as logically presented as in these pages.  • Its succinct approach to basic photographic principles and techniques.  • Its in-depth study of photographic seeing, aimed at strengthening the photographer's sense of perception in achieving striking pictorial effects.  • Its innovative suggestions for creative variations in picture-taking techniques, with unusual photographs that further excite the imagination as they illustrate the methods discussed.  • Its introduction to the photographic darkroom, from fundamentals to more exotic processes.  Technical accuracy, based on painstaking research, is the backbone of this outstanding work. From page to page and chapter to chapter, every question you could ever conceive of is answered clearly and completely. Moreover, the book's hundreds of outstanding black-and-white and color photographs, diagrams, and tables augment the text every step of the way for further comprehension.  Yet, perhaps its best asset is its loose-leaf format: designed in this way, it permits continuous updating of material through a special supplement service. This guarantees that the MINOLTA SYSTEM HANDBOOK will never be out-of-date and will always provide the fast fingertip facts that photographers rely upon for success in their work. No matter what Minolta equipment you now own or plan to own, this two-volume handbook will prove to be the most essential accessory you will ever purchase.

Cas Oorthuys,Cas Oorthuys,photography,First published in 2004,/works/OL23946127W,/authors/OL126314A/Cas_Oorthuys,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Nederlands Fotomuseum|Language Dutch|Pages 528,"De Nederlandse fotograaf Cas Oorthuys heeft tussen het interbellum en de jaren zeventig de wereld afgereisd. De beelden die hij in die periode maakt zijn enerzijds prachtige momentopnames van een wereld in verandering maar tonen anderzijds ook het tijdloze van bepaalde landschappen, samenlevingen en culturen. Politiek geëngageerd als hij was, had hij tot doel onder meer de impact van de industrie op het sociale en geografische weefsel in beeld te brengen. Hij had een bijzondere interesse in het arbeiders- en boerenbestaan, maar ook in de urbanisatie van grootsteden als Parijs en New York of de dekolonisatie van Zuidoost-Azië. Tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog integreerde hij het leven van de Nederlandse verzetsstrijders in zijn werk. Hij capteerde (illegaal) de barre levensomstandigheden en het dagelijkse lijden. Oorthuys gebruikte fotografie als wapen, maar maakte ook werk vanuit een vorm van human interest. Na de oorlog heeft hij als geen andere fotoƯgraaf in de periode van de wederopbouw uitdrukking gegeven aan het groeiende zelfbewustzijn van de Nederlanders. Het Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam bewaart het archief van Oorthuys, dat zo'n 440.000 negatieven telt en door de fotograaf zelf nauwgezet en systematisch gedocumenteerd werd. De archieven bestaan vooral uit contactvellen, waarop Oorthuys zelf aantekeningen maakte. Een tentoonstelling in het Fotomuseum in het najaar van 2018 en deze publicatie bundelen een grote hoeveelheid van nooit eerder gepubliceerde contactvellen en tonen hiermee voor het eerst de reikƯwijdte van het oeuvre van Cas Oorthuys en zijn belangrijke positie binnen de Europese naoorlogse fotografie.00Exhibition: Nederlands Fotomuseum, Rotterdam, The Netherlands (15.09.2018 - 13.01.2019).

Commentaries enhance the viewing by describing in detail what makes each image unique and remarkable. Surprisingly, this collaborative work began as the result of a casual meeting on a photography web site for the exchange of ideas and comments. The two authors, Mildred Alpern and Robert Tallent, thus embarked on a long running and on-going interchange in cyberspace.  Their separate introductions outline the setting for the thirty images in this book, describe the ways in which their collaboration developed as a shared experience of image taking and viewing, and provide the reader with sharp insights into ways of looking at all photographs.

In his trademark easy-to-understand style, Bryan Peterson explains how flash works and how to go beyond TTL (through-the-lens) automatic flash to master manual flash, allowing the photographer to control the quality, shape, direction, and overall effect of the light for a perfect flash exposure every time"" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This first retrospective looks at the worlds of street art, graffiti and life on the creative margins from an appreciative insider's point of view. It features documentary photographs of San Francisco artists like Barry McGee, Margaret Killgallen and Chris Johanson, with whom she shared a distinct and elusive sensibility, as well as others from Los Angeles and her home town of New York, including Phil Frost, Mike Mills and Ed Templeton. Also included is a DVD documenting the scene imported to Tokyo and focused on 13 artists in particular -- including McGee, Johanson, Mills, Killgallen, Templeton, Frost, Thomas Campbell, Stephen Powers, Tommy Guerrero, Josh Lozcano, Brendon Fowler and Aaron Rose. Through candid interviews, footage of art in action, and a massive demolition derby in the streets of Tokyo, the film captures these artists just before they broke through to the mainstream. It is about building things up, knocking them down and the simple enjoyment of making work with friends before the business of art takes hold. Features extra rare footage of all of the artists as well as short films about Johanson and Gonzales.""--Amazon   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Where do the limits of its authorship, spectatorship and democracy cross paths? These are questions at the heart of untrained Sydney-based artist Luke Le's photographic practice. In his first major artist book - What are you looking for? - Le reroutes notions of diarism and the impromptu to broach new aesthetic and philosophical terrains. A kind of open letter to a former life in Melbourne, the book forms both an intensely personal gesture and a wider provocation toward the subjectivities and assumptions that underpin photography itself. These raw, intuitive images - created from scans of degraded Risograph prints - are at once rooted in and free of place. Their dynamic gaze veers toward specificity, but never quite lands. Amidst the noise of their gritty, fine grain, Le's images leave as many questions as answers. --Publisher infomation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the past five years, Mexican photographer Arturo Soto explored the longstanding division between town and gown through a careful selection of spaces and objects. His visual narrative is loosely structured around the following thematic strands: notions of home and homelessness, the looming presence of Brexit, the conflicted local economy, and the diversity of the city's neighborhoods. In short texts Soto describes his experience of the city, and his fascination with its history and myths. The work challenges an easy judgment on Oxford and its established narratives of tradition, influence, and power. In his photography as well as his written observations, Soto proves that his pen is as sharp as his eye.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Together with our three young children we travel through Europe, looking for special landscapes to work and live in. Last year we traveled to Sweden, Norway, Ireland and Scotland. The most important theme in our work is the relationship between man and nature. We research this theme by working with artificial light in landscapes. In 2018 we have worked on the 'Mapping' series, where we project lines with a laser pen onto the landscape. With this series we investigate, in addition to subjectivism, the human inclination to structure, organize and understand the landscape. The 'scans' that arise after projecting the lines, visualize a part of the endless possibilities to experience a landscape.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Country.rock,Morten Andersen,photography,First published in 2017,/works/OL32565425W,/authors/OL11480459A/Morten_Andersen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Teknisk industri|Language English,"The photobook 'Country.Rock' by Morten Andersen is the result of multiple trips to Northern Norway over a period of 3-4 years. The book depicts the harsh climate and the vast untouched terrain of the north, juxtaposed against the region's small, remote communities. Andersen takes an unconventional approach to documentary photography, situating the images in 'Country.Rock' against the backdrop of a sci-fi inspired, post-apocalyptic narrative. In Andersen's imagined future, a catastrophic event has made Europe's urban population centres uninhabitable. Survivors - most of them young - have migrated north, forging new communities and developing new ways of living. The north is conceived as a refuge from the political and social failures of the past; a blank slate for building a radical, post-capitalist future.

Ever since childhood, she has been drawn to the rocky landscapes of Scandinavia. A few years ago, her eyes fell upon the reds, browns and purples of granite and porphyry found on sandy Dutch terrains. These stones speak of the migratory routes that they followed during the glaciations. Researching the geological backgrounds of these glacial erratics, she was pointed to two regions: the province of Dalarna in central Sweden and the Åland archipelago in Finland. Her urge to travel up north was reawakened. A Guide Through Hue is a record of Eimermacher's observations and leads the viewer to where the rocks are laid bare, to the open veins that pigment the landscape and guide the eye from the moment they are attuned to the hue. Reddish, pale pink, purple and brownish granite and porphyry, often bleached in various gradations through weathering; here and there accompanied by greyish and pale-coloured metamorphic rock interlaced with ornamental strands. Leaving behind their native Scandinavian bedrock, their presence gradually spreads, scatters and finally fades into the Dutch flatlands; ignoring national borders as well as the boundaries of nature and culture. What can be seen on the one hand as representatives of a migratory, homeless state of being, can be experienced on the other as interconnectedness and surrender to the universal condition of constant change   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In doing so he has focused on yet another remote inner-Austrian town, which is itself retrospective in its orientation and therefore underscores the nature of photography as an image of remembrance; but unlike the two aforementioned localities, Mariazell is also bound to the presence of the holy. The town of Mariazell is a perfect illustration of how the circles out of which the centre defines itself can be concealed. Of how loftily the centre towers above all else, and its axiality is broken as it descends into the profane. Erwin Polanc has captured that stumble and the reactions of the profane.

Williams werd geïnspireerd door het bezoeken van de beroemde tentoonstelling ""The Family of Man"" in Sydney, 1959. Hij ontwikkelde zich vanaf het begin als straat fotograaf in de meest strikte betekenis van het woord. Hij liep willekeurig door straten en plaats en wachtte tot het juiste moment om op de ontspanknop te drukken van zijn goed voorbereidde camera. Naast zijn grote hoeveelheid werk dat hij maakte als fotograaf, en waarvan de hoogtepunten in dit boek staan, begon hij een van de eerste fotogaleriën in Australië en was hij het eerste hoofd fotografie op de Sydney College of the Arts waar hij ook de legendarische leraar was die de volgende generatie Australische fotografen opleidde.0Eind jaren '80 van de vorige eeuw bestudeerde hij de cultureel historische waarde van fotografie. Zijn academische graad behaald hij met een studie naar de invloed van de Duitse avant-garde op Australische kunst in de jaren '20, waarbij een publicatie het licht zag. Vervolgens verschenen er nog diverse historische publicaties van zijn hand en ook een bescheiden monografie met zijn fotografie.0Dit boek is het eerbetoon aan John Williams en vormt tegelijkertijd een presentatie van zijn fotografie aan een internationaal publiek. John Williams behoort tot de beste Australische straatfotografen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Seizing the Bygone Light: A Tribute to Early Photography,Cendrine Marrouat,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL29276026W,/authors/OL9242103A/Cendrine_Marrouat,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL40257482M-M.jpg,"Publish Date March 16, 2021|Publisher  Independently Published","The medium of limitless possibilities that is photography has been with us for almost 200 years.  Despite its great advancements, its early days still influence and dazzle a majority of professional photographers and artists. Such is the case of Cendrine Marrouat, Hadiya Ali and David Ellis.  The result? Seizing the Bygone Light: A Tribute to Early Photography. This unique collection of artistic styles brings together different innovative concepts of both gripping writing and stunning visual imagery.  In the first part of the book, photographer and painter Ali introduces us to two of her favorite photographers by reimagining and recreating images in the nature of her photographic idols -- Irving Penn and Karl Blossfeldt.  In the second part, photographer, poet, and author Marrouat shares a selection of her reminigrams, a digital style that she personally created to honor and pay homage to the early days of photography.  Author and poet Ellis rounds things off with a series of pareiku poems (the poetry form he co-created with Marrouat), offering fresh outlooks for his sincere, heartfelt adoration of photography of the past.  A fascinating and compelling book, Seizing the Bygone Light: A Tribute to Early Photography will leave you with a deep sense of appreciation and a greater understanding of photography.

He made his debut in 1973, but his real breakthrough came a decade later with an exhibition entitled Rost (Rust) at the former museum of photography, now incorporated into Moderna Museet. Then, as later in his career, Dawid showed how something that appears commonplace: a bent, rusty nail can be transformed into something unique and artistically expressive. In his subsequent works he has continued to challenge established concepts and to push the boundaries of photographic art. Dawid is not known for his portraits. Now, with the first full-scale exhibition of these works, visitors have the opportunity to discover a previously unknown aspect of his art. According to Dawid, pictures of friends were the starting point for most of the portraits. In many cases, he has used the same silhouette-like imagery as in his other works. Some of the portraits are reinterpretations of colleagues' images. In exceptional cases, such as his self-portrait, Dawid has abandoned the constraints of form and given free rein to emotions.

Most often, that crafting of light is spoken of in terms of the quality and quantity of light. But there is an important, third component of light that heavily influences the final look of the image: the color of light. In Chroma: A Photographer's Guide to Lighting with Color, photographer Nick Fancher helps you elevate your game when it comes to introducing the bold, creative, and intentional use of color into your work. Whether you're using a high-powered strobe or a small hotshoe flash, Chroma is for you. Nick begins with a discussion of color theory, gels, and white balance, then examines how to determine which colors complement your subject matter (whether that's people or products).""--Amazon.com.

Written in a comprehensive, yet easy-to-understand format, this book details all of the necessary steps involved in panoramic photography: from the production of digital and analog picture sequences, to ""stitching"" using appropriate software tools, all the way to publishing interactive panoramas on the Internet. The book introduces the concept of producing cylindrical and spherical panoramas and explains how to link individual panoramas to create virtual tours. The production of interactive object presentations - or so-called object movies - also is described. Software products that receive mention include REALVIZ Stitcher, VR Worx and PanoTools, with attention also being paid to Internet publication using QuickTime VR, PTViewer, VRML, iPIX and other panorama viewers. Regardless if the digital pictures are taken with a panoramic camera, a fisheye lens or using the single row or multi-row technique: this book offers practical tips and tricks for every alternative. Detailed comparisons of the individual techniques make it easier to decide on the appropriate method for specific goals. This useful information adds an exciting dimension to panoramic photography and leads to high quality results that speak for themselves.

Bruce Davidson,Bruce Davidson,photography,First published in 2011,/works/OL20045052W,/authors/OL460691A/Bruce_Davidson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 316,"""Bruce Davidson began his passionate relationship with photography very early, at the age of 10 when his mother built a darkroom in their home and he began to photograph the streets of his neighborhood. From that moment his work would be characterized by a personal vision of reality which is manifested in his art, not only in the individual images, but also in the effect produced by the reiteration, research and study of themes and characters over time. Because of his personal style together with his interest in the struggles and achievements of the people he photographs, his work provides a unique perspective on the development of twentieth century society, especially in the United States. The exhibition contemplates a journey through the artist's long career including some of his most famous series, such as Brooklyn Gang, East 100th Street and Time of Change: the Civil Rights Movement as well as his most recent works, Nature of Paris and Nature of Los Angeles. The series shown in the exhibition reveal Bruce Davidson's humanist view. People are the center of his photography and the artist presents us with a variety of realities in different countries. Social tensions in England, the Welsh miners, the Brooklyn street gangs, the struggle for human rights in the United States and the harshness of life in Harlem are just some of his subjects. His work reflects an ethical commitment to the harsh realities of the precarious and vulnerable environments in which the daily life of the people photographed unfolds""--Provided by publisher.

You must first approach the subject with the proper sense of perception, with the ability to visualize the finished print before you commit a scene to pixels, but still be flexible and spontaneous. Master Fine Art photographer Vincent Versace has spent his career learning and teaching the art of perception and how to translate it into stunning images. In Welcome to Oz, he delves into what it means to approach digital photography cinematically, to use your perception, your camera, and Photoshop to capture the movement of life in a still image.  Adapt your workflow to the image so you always know how best to use your tools Turn a seemingly impossible photographic scenario into a successful image Practice ""image harvesting"" to combine the best parts of many captures to create an optimum final result Create black and white prints that have the look, feel and ""richness"" of traditional silver prints without ever leaving the RGB color space   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Rather than sift through hundreds of pages detailing every last Photoshop feature and function (both old and new), you can go directly to the new features that interest you the most and get the explanations you desire in the classic Ben Willmore style--intuitive, crystal clear, and in-depth. By focusing on a single topic--what's new in this version--the award-winning author provides precisely what experienced Photoshop users have been clamoring for, in exactly the depth they demand. After reading this book--even if you've been using CS3 for a while--don't be surprised to hear yourself say, 'I didn't know CS3 did that!' In addition to learning the new features in no time flat, a welcome side effect of learning from Ben is that you can expect to become a better, faster and more efficient Photoshop user.

How to Make Good Pictures,Eastman Kodak Company of New York.,photography,First published in 1965,/works/OL23992771M,/authors/OL216029A/Eastman_Kodak_Company_of_New_York.,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23992771M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1965|Publisher  Eastman Kodak Company of New York|Language English|Pages 192,"Most people really like the pictures they snap. Many are bothered, though, by a nagging suspicion that they could do even better, but that the price of increased proficiency would be lota of money, lots of intricate equipment, and lots of wrestling with technical complexities.    This isn't so and How To Make Good Pictures proves it. In all of its 192 pages there's hardly a word that would confuse a rank beginner. It is a book devoted to the premise that the easy way is usually the best way and that a panoply of gadgetry may swell the ego, but won't necessarily improve either the fun or the results of snapshooting.    To advance this idea, it first outlines the basic essentials of making sharp pictures and a few of the little tricks that turn a sharp picture into a really good one. Then, there are extensive sections full of well-tested ideas for obtaining better black-and-white and color snapshots of babies, children, adults, animals, scenery, flowers, sports; of special events and vacations; and on trick photography.    Its chapters on indoor shooting"" cover not only the conventional means but some extremely easy ways of snapping fine Pictures by the natural, existing light. In addition, it explains the workings of exposure meters, color films, and just what    happens inside film to create a picture.    This entirely new, up-to-date edition of the world's most popular book on picture taking will help almost anyone with any kind of camera get more pleasure and satisfaction out of his photographic activities. Its more than four hundred illustrations, many in full color, alone provide enough good snapshot ideas to keep most people profitably occupied for a long, long time.

Témoin du chaos de la guerre et de ses ravages, il saisit la résilience de ceux qui endurent l'inconcevable. Reza révèle avec une rare sensibilité la limite invisible où la joie côtoie le désespoir, où l'indulgence se heurte au conflit, mais où la vie triomphe toujours. Depuis 30 ans, il consacre sa vie au témoignage et nous offre aujourd'hui Entre guerres et paix, un recueil d'images et de récits poignants. Nous voyageons avec Reza du Kurdistan à l'Afghanistan, du Liban à la Turquie, du Pakistan à la Chine, de Sarajevo au Caire, du Rwanda à l'Arabie Saoudite, de l'Afrique du Sud à la France. Alors, toujours plus au cœur de la condition humaine, nous devinons la grandeur de l'humanité, comme ses plus grandes défaites. Puis, les images fascinantes de Reza, comme les histoires qu'il partage, prennent le pouvoir. Dans cet ouvrage de référence, Reza raconte le désarroi des humains pris dans la tourmente, mais aussi les cultures du monde auxquelles ils appartiennent, les traditions, l'Histoire et, plus que tout, son espoir infaillible en un monde meilleur. Les photos de Reza ont fait le tour du monde et la une des plus grands journaux et magazines : Newsweek, Time Magazine, GEO, et bien entendu National Geographic, dont il est l'un des plus brillants photographes.

Marilyn Nance. Last day in Lagos,Marilyn Nance,photography,First published in 2022,/works/OL31888426W,/authors/OL3649158A/Marilyn_Nance,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Fourthwall Books|Language English|Pages 280,"From January 15 to February 12, 1977, more than 15,000 artists, intellectuals and performers from 55 nations worldwide gathered in Lagos, Nigeria, for the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, also known as FESTAC?77. Taking place in the heyday of Nigeria?s oil wealth and following the African continent?s potent decade of decolonization, FESTAC?77 was the peak of Pan-Africanist expression. Among the musicians, writers, artists and cultural leaders in attendance were Ellsworth Ausby, Milford Graves, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, Samella Lewis, Audre Lorde, Winnie Owens, Miriam Makeba, Valerie Maynard, Queen Mother Moore and Sun Ra.00While serving as the photographer for the US contingent of the North American delegation, Brooklyn-based photographer Marilyn Nance made more than 1,500 images throughout the course of the festival?one of the most comprehensive photographic accounts of FESTAC?77. Drawing from Nance?s extensive archive, most of which has never before been published, Last Day in Lagos chronicles the exuberant intensity and sociopolitical significance of this extraordinary event.00Over the course of five decades, Marilyn Nance (born 1953) has produced images of unique moments in the cultural history of the US and the African Diaspora. Nance is a two-time finalist for the W. Eugene Smith Award in Humanistic Photography. Her work is in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Library of Congress, and has been published in The World History of Photography, History of Women in Photography and The Black Photographers Annual.

Ces clubs encadraient l'essor de la pratique photographique en publiant des revues, en organisant de grandes expositions qui impliquaient, avec la photographie d'art, de nombreux domaines d'utilisation de ce médium : l'astronomie, la biologie, l'anthropologie, la topographie et, de plus en plus fréquemment, la documentation du folklore européen. L'espace public ainsi formé, faisait émerger une culture partagée à visée citoyenne, fondée sur les images. D'abord dédiée à l'éducation de l'oeil en art et en science, cet espace public tendait de plus en plus à se replier sur les identités régionales et nationales en employant les amateurs comme source de documentation ethnographique. Pourquoi étaient-ce les amateurs et non la presse, l'industrie ou les institutions culturelles, qui se trouvaient placés au coeur de ce projet ? Quel était l'horizon politique de ces images dans une Allemagne marquée, après le retrait de Bismarck, par ce qu'on peut appeler une crise d'identité culturelle? Quel fut exactement le rôle de ces images dans la construction ""par le bas"" d'une identité nationale ?""--P. [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

El presente volumen reúne las páginas a ella dedicadas por el filósofo alemán, algunas de las cuales son poco conocidas, ya que se encuentran dispersas en reseñas y crónicas periodísticas, mientras que otras se hallan incorporadas a ensayos literarios o bien a escritos de carácter autobiográfico (sin contar con las anotaciones y citas al respecto incluidas en su magno proyecto sobre el París decimonónico).  Benjamin piensa la fotografía históricamente. En su condición de casi testigo reconstruye sus comienzos con amena y poética erudición desde la proximidad de una infancia todavía decimonónica; analiza su desarrollo en relación con las vanguardias y, por último, la convierte en ejemplo privilegiado de esas imágenes técnicamente reproducibles que, al subvertir las condiciones de la recepción del arte, favorecieron su difusión masiva con consecuencias no menos revolucionarias.

Über Charlotte Joël (1887–1943), die Photographin vieler berühmter Porträts, ist bis heute wenig bekannt. Bis in die dreißiger Jahre hat sie fünfundzwanzig Jahre lang ein Atelier in Charlottenburg geführt, nahe dem Berliner Bahnhof Zoo. Als Jüdin musste sie es aufgeben. Viele von denen, die vor ihrer Kamera saßen, tragen große Namen: Walter Benjamin und seine Familie etwa, Martin Buber, Marlene Dietrich, die spätere Frau Theodor W. Adornos Gretel Karplus, Karl Kraus oder Gustav Landauer. Ihre emphatischen Aufnahmen von Kindern erschienen in Zeitschriften und wurden von Postkartenverlagen herausgegeben. Doch von ihr selbst ist kein Porträt überliefert.  Wer war diese Frau, die so einen bedeutenden Kundenkreis hatte? Persönliche Aufzeichnungen sind nicht bekannt. Nur in wenigen erhaltenen Briefen gibt sie etwas von sich preis.  Werner Kohlert hat zusammengetragen, was über ihr Leben, ihre Arbeit und ihr jüdisches Schicksal in Erfahrung zu bringen war. Friedrich Pfäfflin hat über Jahre in öffentlichen und privaten Sammlungen ihre Photographien aufgespürt und den Werkkatalog erarbeitet.  Endlich bekommt Charlotte Joël die Aufmerksamkeit, die sie schon lange verdient.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dugan reflects on desire, intimacy, companionship, and the ways our identities are shaped by these experiences. In this highly personal collection of work, Dugan brings together self-portraits, portraits of individuals and couples, and still lifes, interwoven with diaristic writings reflecting on relationships, solitude, family, loss, healing, and the transformations that define a life. Dugan has long used photography to understand their own identity and to connect with others on a deeper level. Their process of working slowly and collaboratively discloses moments of heightened psychological intensity in images that transcend the specifics of a particular person or place, engaging with what it means to know oneself alongside and through others. Using medium-format cameras and natural lighting, Dugan employs traditional photographic practices to depict these contemporary subjects, resulting in images that both evoke and reimagine the conventional dynamics of art-historical portraiture. Brought together here, these photographs function as an extended, oblique self-portrait as much as a catalogue of friends and loved ones. Through a diffuse but studied sequence of image and text, Look at me like you love me brings our attention to one of the most powerful and complex forms of intimacy - that of seeing and being seen.""--Publisher's description.

In Blind Spot, readers follow Coles inimitable artistic vision into the visual realm as he continues to refine the voice, eye, and intellectual obsessions that earned him such acclaim for Open City. Here, journey through more than 150 of Coles full-color, original photos, each accompanied by his lyrical and evocative prose, forming a multimedia diary of years of near-constant travel: from a park in Berlin to a mountain range in Switzerland, a church exterior in Lagos to a parking lot in Brooklyn; landscapes, beautiful or quotidian, that inspire Coles memories, fantasies, and introspections. Ships in Capri remind him of the work of writers from Homer to Edna O'Brien; a hotel room in Wannsee brings back a disturbing dream about a friends death; a home in Tivoli evokes a transformative period of semi-blindness, after which ""the photography changed. . . . The looking changed."" As exquisitely wrought as the work of Anne Carson or Chris Marker, Blind Spot is a testament to the art of seeing by one of the most powerful and original voices in contemporary literature.

Lewis Baltz,Lewis Baltz,photography,First published in 2017,/works/OL20060053W,/authors/OL605921A/Lewis_Baltz,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 330,"This comprehensive book accompanies the first large retrospective exhibition of Lewis Baltz's work following his passing in 2014. 'Lewis Baltz' explores the artist's oeuvre as a complex whole of interrelated series, from his first 'Prototypes' and 'The Tract Houses' to 'Park City', 'San Quentin Point', and 'Candlestick Point' through to 'New Sites of Technology' and 'Venezia Marghera', all published by Steidl. The book simultaneously locates Baltz's work in the context of photography and contemporary art since the 1970s, to fully examine his significant influence and legacy. Baltz is one of the most prominent representatives of the New Topographics movement, which was seminal to the development of conceptual photography. His photo series document the impact of industrial civilization on the landscape, focusing on places outside the bounds of canonical reception: urban wastelands, abandoned industrial sites, warehouses.

In addition, he has always been active as a photographer and after obtaining his professional diploma in photography at the Nederlandse Fotovakschool, this has become his second profession. His work partly reflects his ancient calling, geology and the wider natural sciences, but other subjects and styles are also part of his work. His photos are regularly exhibited in galleries and museums and are also regularly published in national and international publications. This book presents a selection of candid photography or street photography that Wiersma has practiced from an early age, in his own country or during short or longer periods abroad. Photos of people in their spontaneous actions, whether or not aware of the recording. People indoors, on the street, in city or country, busy with something or not  Dirk Wiersma is van huis uit geoloog en heeft geruime tijd gewerkt in dat vakgebied, zowel in Nederland als het buitenland. Daarnaast is hij altijd actief geweest als fotograaf en na het behalen van het vakdiploma fotografie aan de Nederlandse Fotovakschool is dat zijn tweede beroep geworden. Zijn werk weerspiegelt deels zijn oude roeping, geologie en de natuurwetenschappen in ruimere zin, maar ook andere onderwerpen en stijlen zijn onderdeel van zijn werk. Zijn foto's worden regelmatig tentoongesteld in galeries en musea en verschijnen daarnaast geregeld in binnen- en buitenlandse publicaties. Dit boek presenteert een selectie uit de candid fotografie oftewel straatfotografie die Wiersma van jongs af aan heeft beoefend, in eigen land dan wel tijdens korte of langduriger buitenlandse periodes.

The sharing of these works produced in recent years, mainly in Argentina, does not intend to set up a historical course but to point out towards a historicized, transversal, multiple photograph, inclined to the political and crossed by discontinuities and differences. The unique displays of these images, their details and visual strategies, allow us to look at the relationships of photography with the world, recent history, politics, violence. Surrounding images with words not to explain them: to join with them to the precise inquiry of the time that they propose. To point us to a possible path - in that way so improbable in which the images indicate - and to follow that path. Thinking about the visual poetics of each series, interspersing them and putting in relation their historical dimension, their material imprint, the craftsmanship or sophisticated of their artifacts. It is precisely as artifacts - that is, constructed objects - that these works visually question the idea of photographic record, while not fail to underscore their critical adherence to the world they are approaching and their potential to deploy a present intervention.""

Een rondje IJsselmeer,Edwin Donders,photography,First published in 2022,/works/OL31818079W,/authors/OL11564260A/Edwin_Donders,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Komma, Uitgeverij|Language Dutch|Pages 192","Photographer and cameraman Edwin Donders has seen the banks change since he lived on the IJsselmeer. Dikes are strengthened and raised, beaches disappear and appear. Resorts are popping up like mushrooms. Just like the wind farms. And the Afsluitdijk cannot escape modernization either. His eye is often drawn to circumstances in which people try to make 'the best' of it and thereby leave their mark. In 'A round IJsselmeer' we see a beautiful black and white photo series in which Edwin recorded our interventions around the IJsselmeer. Sometimes subtle and almost unnoticeable, more often very present. Edwin decided not only to photograph the IJsselmeer, but also to delve further into the lake, which used to be a dangerous inland sea. He came across the collection 'Sagas and legends around the Zuiderzee' from 1932 by Simon Franke. The old-fashioned, yet fluent language of Simon Franke formed such a nice contrast with the modern photos of Edwin that he decided to select a number of stories and include them in their entirety in the book  Fotograaf en cameraman Edwin Donders ziet sinds hij aan het IJsselmeer woont de oevers veranderen. Dijken worden versterkt en verhoogd, strandjes verdwijnen en verschijnen. Resorts schieten als paddenstoelen uit de grond. Net zoals de windmolenparken. En ook de Afsluitdijk ontkomt niet aan modernisering. Zijn oog valt vaak op omstandigheden waarbij de mens er 'het beste' van probeert te maken en daardoor zijn sporen nalaat. In 'Een rondje IJsselmeer' zien we een prachtige zwart-wit fotoserie waarbij Edwin onze ingrepen rondom het IJsselmeer heeft vastgelegd. Soms subtiel en bijna niet op te merken, vaker groots aanwezig. Edwin besloot niet alleen het IJsselmeer te fotograferen, maar zich ook verder te verdiepen in het meer wat vroeger een gevaarlijk binnenzee was. Zo stuitte hij op de bundel 'Sagen en legenden rond de Zuiderzee 'uit 1932 van Simon Franke. Het ouderwetse, maar toch vlotte taalgebruik van Simon Franke vormde zo'n mooi contrast met de moderne foto's van Edwin dat hij besloot een aantal verhalen te selecteren en integraal in het boek op te nemen   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But do these things bring us closer to nature or make that distance greater? This phenomenon inspired Dutch visual artist Annegien van Doorn to create 'Biophilia', a photobook full of strange and artificial encounters with nature, but also its personification. Through her wry reflection on the absurdity of the world we create, she hopes to encourage a revaluation of actual nature. Do flowers compare colours? Do fish want to be kissed?

A world of repeated meetings with similar and monotonous people, airports and hotels. Routines of breakfasts, dinners and days in solitude and silence. Rituals of takeoffs, landings and waits. A pause forced by the distance in which I indulged in days of aimless walking and spying on people, scenes and dramas. To probe their thoughts, to imagine them. There is something that appears when we do not know that they are watching us and we immerse ourselves in that permeable and sensitive state. This book is my way of navigating those spaces and moods. It is my possibility to conjure silences, streets and days of solitude to discover myself as an unspoken subject in the furtive gaze of ""The Others"".

After his photos of the Parisian seamy left unfiltered around the world, his name as a street photographer is established. The publication 'Early Ed' highlights the period prior to his success (1944-1956). How Van der Elsken was received by Christian anarchist anti-militarists in Bergeijk during the last year of the war; how he became acquainted with photography in Wormerveer; how he immersed himself in high society circles in Paris. Documents from the archives of the Leiden University Library and the Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam show a searching Ed van der Elsken. Contact sheets reveal a photographic universe populated by models, stars, musicians, cats, dogs, partygoers, artists and top athletes. There is a perception that Ed was opposed to corporate reporting, but his pocket agenda is full of business initiatives for advertising campaigns. Examples are weaving mill De Ploeg and furniture brand Spectrum, UMS Pastoe and PTT Post en Telecom. Within this oeuvre he develops a remarkably personal style with an emphasis on interaction between the models. He likes to use acquaintances from his own circle for the necessary freedom of movement. A new love story unfolds against the background of the coldest winter month of the twentieth century  De publicatie in 1956 van 'Een Liefdesgeschiedenis in Saint Germain des Prés' markeert de internationale doorbraak van Ed van der Elsken. Nadat zijn foto's van de Parijse zelfkant ongefilterd de wereld rondgaan, is zijn naam als straatfotograaf gevestigd. De uitgave 'Early Ed' belicht de periode voorafgaand aan zijn succes (1944-1956). Hoe Van der Elsken tijdens het laatste oorlogsjaar werd opgevangen door christen-anarchistische antimilitaristen in Bergeijk; hoe hij in Wormerveer kennismaakte met de fotografie; hoe hij zich in Parijs onderdompelde in high society kringen. Documenten uit de archieven van de Universiteitsbibliotheek Leiden en het Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam tonen een zoekende Ed van der Elsken. Contactvellen leggen een fotografisch universum bloot, bevolkt door modellen, sterren, muzikanten, katten, honden, feestgangers, kunstenaars en topsporters. Het beeld bestaat dat Ed zich verzette tegen bedrijfsreportages, maar zijn zakagenda staat bol van de zakelijke initiatieven voor reclamecampagnes. Voorbeelden zijn Weverij De Ploeg en meubelmerk't Spectrum, UMS Pastoe en PTT Post en Telecom. Binnen dit oeuvre ontwikkelt hij een opmerkelijk persoonlijke stijl met de nadruk op interactie tussen de modellen. Graag gebruikt hij bekenden uit zijn eigen kring voor de nodige bewegingsvrijheid.

While reconfiguring the images, she generates a space that defies specificity; transient landscapes that blur place, memory, and time in a conflation of reality and the imaginary. These reference historical processes, such as early pictorialist tendencies of combination printing and modernist experiments with the materiality of film, yet her work also engages with contemporary discourses on manipulation, the analogue/digital divide, and the effects these have on photography's status.

Presented as an archive from a truck driver named Ivan Putnik, the photographs are actually made by various amateur photographers who uploaded the photospheres to Google Street View.00Fascinated by the visual variety, Vaste Programme (IT) recontextualized the images to create a fictional story. Apart from showing life in a remote area of the world, the cropped stills present universal environmental concerns such as pollution, the extraction of fossil fuels and the transformation of the landscape. Even though the available imagery originates from a specific subset of the population, it does not amplify the archetypal image of life in Siberia, but rather provides the reader with a combination of both classic and unusual sights. From the beauty of unspoiled nature to grotesque industrial projects, and from monolithic Soviet-era suburbs to weirdly charming interiors. The Long Way Home highlights what is often overlooked, and focuses on the hidden gems of vernacular photography.00Vaste Programme is the pseudonym of the young artistic trio from Rome (IT) consisting of Giulia Vigna, Leonardo Magrelli and Alessandro Tini. Their practice focuses on post-photography and new media, aiming to shine a light on everyday visual matter and to reveal new meanings by appropriating this imagery as storytellers.

By means of infographics and a short text, the street becomes a symbol for a culture, a country in its entirety.  Seven years of travel were needed to make this book.  With a focus on detailed street knowledge, this is the perfect gift for travelers and photography enthusiasts alike""--Publisher's description.  200 countries; one street each; seven years of travelling and collecting photos, stories, facts and figures about each country. This is not just another photography book. It reveals everything that a street means to society: education, wisdom, youth, experience, happiness, stories, food, and so much more. This is the raw material of life, drawn directly from the experiences of the Belgian photographer Jeroen Swolfs. Seeing the street as a unifying theme, he travelled in search of that one street in each place - sometimes by a harbour or a railway station - that comprised the country as a whole. Each stunning image conveys culture, colours, rituals, even the history of the city and country where he found them. Swolfs sees the street as a universal meeting place, a platform of crowds, a centre of news and gossip, a place of work, and a playground for children. Swolfs's streets are a matrix for community; his photographs are published at a time when the unique insularity of local communities everywhere has never been more under threat.

Humankind's search for more powerful sources of energy to sustain an urbanizing existence has created an energy transition that, while hugely beneficial to human existence, is now being identified as a source of harm. Just as metabolic disease refers to energy-sourced medical problems, so too the planet, the authors propose, is showing increasing signs of metabolic distress. Through large-scale photographs and a combination of long and short essays ""The Metabolic Landscape"" is an engaging exploration of the unfolding relationship between energy and the landscape, and our interpretation of it.

He often re-photographs prints up to ten times, injecting layer upon layer of distortion and, in the process, emphasising the medium's inability to represent past events accurately or truthfully. His experimentation with delay, reverb and echo in this sense is inspired by certain strains of electronic music, playing with the way one perceives time and altering it in a visual way. This series of haunting, distorted and otherworldly images epitomises his approach.""--Idea Books web site (viewed August 28, 2014).

Working much like a film editor, he creates coherent artistic works that go well beyond the individual shot and the anecdotal scene to suggest endless perspectives of multiple realities. For Giguère the medium is integral to the message and he uses dozens of types of cameras, with a particular interest in popular models made between 1920 and 2005. The wide range of devices produces works that are often unpredictable and, when presented together, impossible to date. Yet, despite Giguère?s fascination with the capture and production of the analog image, his mastery of the digital is subtly apparent throughout. This publication, with its oversized format and dozens of reproductions, echoes the spirit of abundance that characterizes the artist?s work. 0Exhibition: Musée d'art de Joliette, Canada (08.10.16 - 08.01.2017).

This experimental approach gives a unique perspective on a city that is over the years so often visually celebrated. 'Entre Entree' is a very dense, attractive, but at the same time uncanny publication, which is a highlight in Keppel's ongoing research on public space, urban structures and reproduction.

During their first meeting, they decide that their agreement will be a new project. During the lockdowns, they take many walks close to home. Their main principle is that ""a photo is only good if the CONTACT of the photographer with his subject is visible"". Now two years later the publication CONTACT appears.

His work uses the language of film to manoeuvre and influence the interpretation of images and stories. Tapping into our collective filmic memory, he manipulates time, codes, and form, twisting and shaping new narratives that tightly bind visual art and cinematography. The photographs appearing in ‘Savage’ were all taken in New York between 2016 and 2018. Intensely cinematographic, the majority of these images draw the eye to a solitary figure caught in a moment of action, which in turn evokes a deep narrative impulse – familiar scenes that at the same moment exude a sense of underlying conflict and alienation.

Contributors come from the realms of critical theory, fiction, performance art, fashion photography, and museums, as well as film and design, and their conversations bring together history and the contemporary. Comparing the current situation of photographic images with the crisis experienced by representation at the time of the birth of photography, they set our relationship with photographic images in the digital era in perspective. Through these discussions, we come to sense the existential burden of being surrounded by images, while also beginning to grasp the historical depth of a questioning of images that started long before the current generation and engages with crucial political and cultural issues of our time.

Det är 1950-tal, bara några år efter krigets slut och Italien och Spanien är slitna och fattiga som i neorealismens filmer. Tecknaren och författaren Claes Bäckström (1927-2015) fotograferade med konstnärens blick, utan ""konstnärlig"" retorik men med en lågmäld saklighetens poesi. Han såg människor, gator, broar, den fräcka livskraften i gatpojkarnas blick och åtbörder. Det är foton i anspråkslösa format, då kontaktkopierade i tobaksaffärer i Florens och Paris. Och han skrev om resandets drift: avgörande episoder, utmejslade med lätt hand. De rör sig mellan barndomsminnen, platser och oväntade möten, det kan vara boxaren Joe Walcott, tjurfäktaren Dominguín och J.R. Efterkrigstidens försiktiga framtidsljus. Flydd tid, återvunnen tid.

Fotografen och författaren Peter Hanneberg har under tio års tid rest till 50 av jordens allra mest fascinerande öar. Här finns storheter som Madagaskar och Borneo men framför allt har han rest till mindre öar som exempelvis Lofoten, Påskön, Fiji och Mnemba Island. Mest isolerad är Tristan da Cunha, världens mest isolerade bebodda ö ?2 800 kilometer från närmaste granne! Denna bok visar i storslagna bilder och inträngande texter hur natursköna, unika och sårbara öar kan vara ? det sistnämnda ofta som en följd av liten yta och begränsade naturresurser. Här berättas om naturnära ökulturer, deras historia och traditioner ? och hur dessa påverkat naturen. Alla världshav och klimatzoner finns representerade, från Arktis via tropikerna till Antarktis, från Östersjön, Nordsjön och Atlanten via Indiska oceanen till Stilla havet. Med sina rika berättelser om natur, kultur och historia är detta ett slags visuell världsomsegling.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, not all photographed things result in an appealing picture. Some people only photograph sensational objects, often in places far from home. Their everyday, ordinary environment escapes them. Day-to-day reality is plain and easily bores them. Thus, what is least concealed, gets least attention. For this precise reason, I choose to fight the plainness, mundanity, indifference and boredom. My curious, explorative view places ordinary things in a new perspective. This vision needs photography to bring things to life, to let them speak for themselves. Things stay no longer unobserved in the background, as part of a décor, but instead perform on their own behalf. Photography is the revaluation of the ordinariness of day-to-day reality""--Page 123.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Der Buchtitel 'Bilderregungen' kann aus diesem Grund auf zwei Weisen gelesen werden: Bilder-Regungen beschreibt Vorgänge, in denen Bilder etwas bewegen und etwas durch sie bewegt wird. Der Begriff der Bild-Erregungen stellt die Frage: Was bewegt wiederum das Bild?0Das Buch fokussiert u. a. die gestalterischen Mittel, ästhetischen Dispositive und Displays, medialen Ausformungen und Weiterentwicklungen zeitgenössischer Kriegs- und Konfliktfotografie. Fünf Fotograf_innen bilden den Ausgangspunkt der Überlegungen: Christoph Bangert, Shai Kremer, Paula Luttringer, Susan Meiselas und Simon Norfolk.0Entgegen einer allgemeingültigen Aussage darüber, was Kriegs- und Konfliktfotografie ist, richtet sich das Interesse auf die (manchmal paradoxen) Sinnzusammenhänge, -verschiebungen und -ablösungen, die die?Zwischenräume? von Kriegs- und Konfliktfotografie eröffnen, und über deren Potenzial und Beschaffenheit neue Erkenntnisse generiert werden.0Dabei zeigt sich, dass das Wissen um die Produktionsmechanismen von Kriegs- und Konfliktfotografie nicht nur einlädt, mit Sehgewohnheiten zu brechen, sondern nach nachhaltigen Handlungsformen verlangt, die das Gestern und Morgen im Heute mitdenken.

This timely exhibition is drawn from two facets of Neil K. Rector's world-class art collection: Soviet and Russian photography from the 1970s to the early 1990s, and the work of Moscow-based unofficial artists who came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. Combining more than 300 works from these two aspects of the collection, Red Horizon offers fresh perspective on the art and life of this period, and suggests how creativity and critical thinking manifest themselves under the most difficult. Red Horizon looks at the period shortly after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 until the late 1980s and beyond, when artists attempted to represent the everyday realities of the USSR and Russia.""  -- introduction.

However, the work that they make does not conform to the conventional methods and style of documentary photography."" ""Many of these artists' works involve situations that have been staged for the camera: sets have been constructed, actors have been dressed in costumes, and narrative scenarios invented. Other works, however, conform to the conventions of 'straight' photography: they record pre-existing scenes without any kind of direct intervention by the photographer. However, what unites all of these photographs is a sense of theatricality. Ranging from melodramatic reconstructions to the small tales of everyday domestic life, these images - in their different ways - portray our contemporary world as a kind of stage set in which we as actors play out our individual and collective stories."" ""Straddling the boundaries between fact and fiction, these images create a hallucinatory vision of contemporary Britain. This is a Britain that is framed by the gleaming architectures of global corporate business, on one side, and by the neglected streets and hinterlands of its towns and cities, on the other. These are also places that are peopled by social types that we recognize: alienated adolescents, working men, secretaries, city bankers, the down and out. But these photographers have recognized the imaginary power of such scenarios and characters and reconstructed them for us with an irony that is acute and subtle. Through a blurring of the real and the imaginary they offer us a vision of contemporary Britain that is both profound and comical; a black comedy in which bankers throw themselves to their solitary deaths off city buildings, where the police prepare for social insurgency in artificial urban environments, and where mundane kitchen sink scenarios compete with the strange plasticized interiors of offices and shopping malls."" ""Published to coincide with the exhibition held at the Foto Musemn Provincie Antwerpen this book contains reproductions of many of the photographs in the exhibition and other works by the artists, together with essays by Joanna Lowry, David Green (both of the University of Brighton) and Jan Baetens (Universityof Leuven, Belgium)."" --Book Jacket.

Jamais publié, ce fonds photographique embrasse deux décennies. Les années de rupture, du milieu des 50's aux 60's, où se redéfinissent les relations sociales et politiques, tant en Afrique qu'ailleurs, avec la libération des pays du joug colonial, mais aussi la période des indépendances jusqu'aux 70's où s'annoncent la reconnaissance des libertés individuelles et l'affirmation de soi. Ces clichés, au-delà de leur portée historique, témoignent avant tout de l'art de la mise en scène dont était capable de faire preuve les photographes de studio africains. Ces photographies mettent en avant le talent d'Adama, son savoir faire, son imagination et son inventivité; avec peu de moyen il savait magnifier son sujet, donner une âme à son client, faire métier, sans négliger l'humour et la fantaisie.""--Provided by publisher.

Yet the precise nature of the island to which Nick Geboers invites us remains undetermined. The images cannot be read as documenting an existing area, but rather as a poetic evocation of the concept of ""island"". They explore the isolation and sense of seclusion specific to the islander's existence. Each picture is an isolated fragment; the whole, an unfathomable sequence. The sublime landscapes, observations of nature, archaic symbols, and unknown rituals suggest an animistic worldview in which every image, every human trace, seems like an echo of other times.

Alexander was a pioneer of the Light and Space movement that emerged as an important, innovative, and distinctly West Coast approach to art. He is most renowned for his sculptural forms made from cast resin. Their luminous transparency evokes both the purity and arti?ciality of California?s light and colors. ?It may come as a surprise that an artist so well known and admired for minimal and pure sculptures has also made Polaroid photographs of what seems like a maximally impure world.?

Juning's husband left her when their children were young, and all financial responsibility for the family fell to her. For several years, Juning worked as a nanny in Manila, but in 1974, knowing that a local income could not stretch to cover her children's school fees, she decided to look for work abroad. Her youngest child was two years old when she left for Hong Kong. In 1976 my parents and brother, who was then a year old, moved from London to Hong Kong for my father's work with Barings Bank. My mother soon became pregnant with me, and in the spring of 1977 she advertised for a 'mother's help' at Waitrose in Hong Kong; Juning was one of four people who responded to the post. My mother tells me my brother hid each time someone arrived for the interview, until Juning came, when he headed straight for her lap. I'm grateful for my brother's discernment, and that in response it was Juning who my mother chose to employ, because though I have complicated feelings about growing up with someone else's mother and benefiting from her attention while her own children could not, Juning was certainly a very sound and loving person to entrust childcare to.""

But even if much of this work is known from other compilations and different contexts, many items suddenly bear new titles, thus introducing current, topical dimensions of content. The 'Hand:Works' are largely conceptual, but they project an additional meta-level of meaning through the portrayal of people, topographies, texts, as well as the memories of their original contexts, combining them to form a new whole. A striking feature of these pictures is the method of holding something in view of the camera or of bringing something into the photograph which extends into the periphery, the off, as it were. This allows the photographer to stand behind the camera and, at the same time, become a visible part of the motif.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We see images of interior; lamps, pillows and furniture, and different sceneries, a ray of light over a table, a door that opens into a kitchen with a stove and white wooden chair, a snowy view with rooftops covered by a violet veil all intertwined and bound together by the intimate portraits of Siggie, from the age of 12 until she becomes pregnant at the age of 18. The images capture a poetic and timeless universe that spring from the visual narrative of a young girls transition from child to adult--in close dialogue with the physical spaces in which this metamorphosis takes place, and in harmony with the change of seasons from outside the kitchen window. The Polaroid images have been lying in the drawer for many years, and it's with a new, reflected and liberating gaze that Nielsen now has been able to select and compile the images so that the private gets retold and transformed into a generally human and open aesthetic expression""--Provided by publisher.

It is a book about the lives of mothers, about their sons and daughters, about angels and dogs. But also a book about care and love, about dreams big and small. About nights when you sometimes barely see your bed and about the need for an audience or just a hug. A book about busy families in which everything just works again (and sometimes it doesn't), a book about patting your head and the extra pot of soup, about getting up and continuing. 'About Everything That Looks Like Nothing' shows that there are many kinds of 'ordinary lives' in a city. For this book, photographer Sanne Donders followed 33 Rotterdammers from getting up to going to sleep, from young people to women who keep community centers afloat, from caring grandmothers and fathers to athletes and poets. The writers Sanneke van Hassel, Elfie Tromp, Carolina Trujillo, Elsbeth Grievink, Maureen Versprille, Dénis van Vliet, Birgit Bekker and Hanneke van Houwelingen have interviewed various people portrayed, poet Derek Otte has written a comprehensive foreword. In 2016 Sanne Donders won a Silver Camera in the category Art, Culture and Entertainment for the photo series about Eveline, which included in this book.

Over nachten waarin je soms je bed nauwelijks ziet en over de behoefte aan publiek of gewoon een knuffel. Een boek over drukke gezinnen waarin alles toch net weer lukt (en soms ook niet), een boek over de aai over je bol en het extra pannetje soep, over opstaan en weer doorgaan. 'Over Alles wat nergens op lijkt' laat zien dat er in een stad heel veel soorten 'gewone levens' zijn. Voor dit boek volgde fotograaf Sanne Donders 33 Rotterdammers van opstaan tot slapengaan, van jongeren tot vrouwen die buurthuizen drijvende houden, van zorgzame oma?s en vaders tot sporters en dichters.

The programme's aim is to foster critical awareness and ""knowledge-in-action"", where a dialogical approach is central. One of the goals within this, is to deepen the understanding of photography and explore the creative possibilities of the medium. Through conversations with the acclaimed Swedish artist Annika von Hausswolff, the four young photographers share their thoughts on their own work. The discussions touch on certain interests and concerns that to a large extent define contemporary Swedish photography today.

From the intimacy of the situations, the confidential gestures and the direct gaze of the persons being portrayed, his working method becomes present - he takes the time it takes to get to know the people in front of his camera, they trust him and he cares about them""--Publisher's website.

C’est Joel Meyerowitz lui-même qui commente ici son œuvre. Avec son formidable talent de conteur, il nous offre en voix off son « tour du propriétaire ».    Il a choisi d’inverser la chronologie. Il remonte le temps, depuis ses photographies les plus récentes dans l’atelier de Cézanne jusqu’à ses toutes premières images réalisées dans la rue il y a plus de 50 ans. C’est en 1962 que Joel Meyerowitz commence à arpenter les rues de New York muni d’un Leica 35 mm. Excité par l’énergie collective de la ville, par la tension des scènes de théâtre qui s’y nouent, il aiguise au fil du temps un sens instinctif de l’imprévisible et de l’immédiateté qui lui permet de capturer des images inattendues et saisissantes.

The landscape changed due to climatological changes and human resource extraction, and the following attempts at 'restoring' and 'freestablishing' a 'natural' landscape. The narrative pivot point is the violent sand drift in the 16th-19th centuries; how it manifested itself and completely transformed the once fertile landscape into a barren wasteland. Different governments - from kings to elected parliaments - enacted laws tried to reverse it. After 200 years, they 'succeeded' in re-transforming the landscape back to a controlled state, especially suited for tourism. However, today, the dune landscapes are considered 'natural', and conservation efforts are now directed at preserving these. Obviously, any landscape is in a state of constant transition, and these efforts then beg the question: How do you preserve transition? The project RAABJERG of Danish artist Rune Peitersen consists of a publication and a film. The film will premiere at the Biennale für Aktuele Fotografie in Mannheim (DE) in March 2022   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To soothe his feelings of isolation, Farese began taking street photographs drawing inspiration from the spontaneous and observational style of iPhone photographers David Guttenfelder and Gueorgui Pinkhassov and the work of Cartier-Bresson. Images were captured in a mindful, open and receptive manner, alert to interesting viewpoints of everyday things that are hidden in plain view. Beauty in the banal. Over the next five years, Farese continued his deeply personal photographic journey with perceptive guidance from his mentor, the noted British/Egyptian photographer, Laura El-Tantawy. Over 100 of Farese's exquisite images from the collection will be published in his first monograph, 'Am I Not Light'. The work reflects the photographer's experience of arrival, the yearning for connection, and the newfound feeling of solitude. It is a meditation on loneliness, but not on solitary aloneness. Rather it expresses how one can feel alone even whilst being among many   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These are complemented by photographs of plants, insects, pavements and street furniture as well as rain and snowfall.0In a continuous sequence of 91 photographs three years are condensed into one. The images take up basic forms and simple compositions, but again and again they free themselves from comprehensible perspectives and in confronting each other they allow views of unexpected connections. In this game the photographs refer to themselves as a surface for association and reflection and illustrate their offer for perspective.

Many of the things I photographed were gone a year later""--Page 111.  Photographer Gerry Badger only brought out his camera on overcast days in Berlin between 2007 and 2011. His portrait of the citys back streets and dilapidated spaces is rough, full of refuse and graffiti, and almost completely devoid of human presence. This series of images depicts the forgotten corners of a living city, full of history; a fact that has seemingly been banished outside the fringes of the frame. What is left is emptiness, broken architecture, neglected parks, vacant lots, discarded things all fading under a metallic, unfeeling sky. It lends a foreboding sense of loss, an unnamed but tangible, pessimistic outlook on a city floundering in its own forward momentum.  -- Provided by publisher.

Monterey, Mexico 1977) has worked for more than four years, through different enclaves of Latin American cities. From the port of Valparaíso to Puerto Seco in Jalisco, travelling through México City, Monterrey, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and the Bahía de Navidad, the photographer captures in analog, digital and video images the fading signs of modernity or its promises. The book offers the full project (with twice the images of the exhibition) and expands its lines of reading through the texts of philosopher and curator José Luis Barrios, and author Emiliano Monge, who wrote an unpublished story spatially for this work.

The medium used the laws of chemistry and physics to create superbly detailed descriptions of the material world that surpassed all earlier graphic media. Objects were photography's earliest subject. Things, published in association with the Victoria and Albert Museum, draws from the photographs in the museum's collection, which were made by artists, scientists, reporters, advertising and editorial photographers, from the pioneers to the postmoderns. Things includes the work of ninety photographers from Talbot and Julia Margaret Cameron to Edward Weston, Cartier-Bresson, Irving Penn, Diane Arbus and that of a new generation on the cutting edge of recent technology. A tiny whirlygig beetle is reproduced on a gigantic scale from an image using photography, the electron-microscope, digital software and the most advanced inkjet printing. Things is a survey of how we view the physical world, and within the structure of the book is contained the history of photography itself.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is at the cutting edge of contemporary image-making with leading photographers creating work that transcends definitions of art or documentary. This is the first truly international survey of a vibrant, burgeoning field of photography, its masterful image-makers, and their work. William A. Ewing has selected more than 230 photographs by over 100 photographers, ranging from renowned figures such as Susan Derges, Edward Burtynsky, and Simon Norfolk, to younger rising stars including Pieter Hugo, Olaf Otto Becker, and Penelope Umbrico. Each of them represents an individual viewpoint of a shared concernfor our changing landscape and environment. Organized into ten themes Sublime; Pastoral; Artefacts; Rupture; Playground; Scar; Control; Enigma; Hallucination; and Reverie Landmark is an intelligent and poetic survey which captures a genre of photography to perfection.""

C'est à partir des points de rencontre, d'achoppement, et d'instabilité repérés dans cette image si spécifique, que la question de la représentation est abordée. Les questions esthétiques rencontrées sont orientées vers et par l'ultime et premier lieu de forge du rapport aux choses représentées, à savoir : la représentation elle-même et, essentiellement, le sujet regardant. La procédure employée s'apparente approximativement à un transplant de la photographie au sein de champs diversement guidés par l'esthétique, l'ontologie, la poésie, la mythologie, la psychanalyse la phénoménologie..., afin d'en constater l'acclimatation et/ou le rejet. Ce travail s'inscrit dans la continuité d'un premier essai effectué sur la nature de l'image photonique, La photographie comme métaphore d'elle-même.

This year Wendt's work will be exhibited at Documenta in Athens, and a large scale retrospective will take place in the summer of 2017 at Huis Marseille Museum for Photography in Amsterdam.

Thomas Annan of Glasgow,Lionel Gossman,photography,First published in 2015,/works/OL20930531W,/authors/OL29995A/Lionel_Gossman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 192,"In the wake of Glasgow?s transformation in the nineteenth-century into an industrial powerhouse, the ""Second City of the Empire,? a substantial part of the old town of Adam Smith degenerated into an overcrowded and disease-ridden slum. The Old Closes and Streets of Glasgow, Thomas Annan?s photographic record of this central section of the city prior to its demolition in accordance with the City of Glasgow Improvements Act of 1866, is widely recognized as a classic of nineteenth-century documentary photography. Annan?s achievement as a photographer of paintings and a portrait and landscape photographer is less widely known. Thomas Annan: Photographer of Victorian Scotland offers a handy, comprehensive and copiously illustrated overview of the full range of the photographer?s work. The book opens with a brief account of the immediate context of Annan?s career as a photographer: the astonishing florescence of photography in Victorian Scotland. Successive chapters deal with each of the main fields of his activity, touching along the way on issues such as the nineteenth-century debate over the status of photography ? a mechanical practice or an artistic one? ? and the still ongoing controversies surrounding the documentary photograph in particular. While the text itself is intended for the general reader, extensive endnotes amplify particular themes and offer guidance to readers interested in pursuing these themes further.

Christian Cravo is the son of photographer, sculptor and draughtsman Mario Cravo Neto (b. Brazil 1947-2009) and Eva Christensen; and grandson of renowned Bahian sculptor, designer and poet Mário Cravo Júnior (b. Brazil 1923). The photographer, who spent his childhood and adolescence between Brazil and Denmark, took the photographs when he was between 17 and 19 years of age, a period which he spent with his father in Bahia, coming from a season of ten years in Europe and about to return to serve the Danish army. Since the beginning of his professional trajectory, Christian extensively documented India, Haiti and Africa. He mostly photographs the Brazilian Northeast, as a project of life. He is currently living in São Paulo.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Six untitled photographs show television screens broadcasting eerily glowing images of faces and figures into unoccupied rooms in homes and motels across America. As distinctive a portrait of an era as Robert Frank's 'The Americans', 'The Little Screens' grew in number and was not brought together in its entirety until a 2001 exhibition at the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco. Friedlander (b. 1934) is known for his use of surfaces and reflections--from storefront windows to landscapes viewed through car windshields -- to present a pointed view of American life. The photographs that make up The Little Screens represent an early example of this photographic strategy, offering the narrative of a peripatetic photographer moving through the landscape of 1960s America that was in thrall to a new medium. In this astute study, Saul Anton argues that The Little Screens marked the historical intersection of modern art and photography at the moment when television came into its own as the dominant medium of mass culture.

The groundbreaking tool that brought the chemistry and optics together to make photography possible was the camera. During the nineteenth century cameras were mainly owned by professionals or self-educated entrepreneurs. As the technology improved, demand grew from ordinary people for affordable cameras. No longer solely the preserve of commercial photographic studios, cameras were now designed to target new markets: children, women, the snapshooter, the amateur and the professional, alongside specialized and scientific applications such as aerial photography, military use and spying. By the 1950s, electrical features such as battery-controlled shutters and exposure processes had become the norm, leading the way for the computer-run functions in the high-spec models of the 1970s. The arrival of commercially viable digital cameras, which recorded an image on a CCD sensor rather than film from the early 1980s, transformed the camera to a fully electronic device. By the mid-2000s digital cameras were outselling film cameras, and in 2012 six times as many smartphone cameras were sold than digital cameras. This book relates the exciting story of this groundbreaking tool by selecting fifty key camera models and investigating them in chronological order. The origin and development of each model is described in detail, along with its impact on the science, consumption and art of photography. This book is an excellent resource for students of the history of photography, curators of photographic equipment and technophile photographers.

Forms of Japan,Michael Kenna,photography,First published in 2015,/works/OL20028090W,/authors/OL476040A/Michael_Kenna,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 303,"A rocky coast along the sea of Japan; an immense plain of rice fields in the snow; Mount Fuji towering over misty wooded hills; silent temples devoid of people but brimming with Buddhist deities; a Torii gate mysteriously emerging from moving clouds and water-these are a few images from this remarkable collection of photographs by Michael Kenna, whose black-and-white work is highly renowned. Forms of Japan, brilliantly designed by Yvonne Meyer-Lohr, is organised into chapters simply titled, Sea, Land, Trees, Spirit, and Sky. The quietly evocative photographs, often paired with classic haiku poems of Basho, Buson, Issa and others, provide a contemplative portrait of a country better-known for its energy and industry. Gorgeously reproduced to convey the enormous subtleties that exist in Michael Kenna's traditional black-and-white silver prints, the photographs in this book include both well-known and previously unpublished images from all corners of Japan: Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Okinawa and Shikoku.

Founded to preserve such natural beauty for posterity, the national parks represent one of America's crowning achievements and international treasures. The National Parks: An American Legacy tells the story of the parks through the photography of Ian Shive, today's leading national park photographer, as well as through poignant essays by conservancy groups from across the country. Timed to coincide with the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the National Park Service, this lavish volume reveals the grandeur and history of the parks and looks toward what the next 100 years will bring. With more than 200 never-before-seen images of the national parks, including Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon, as well as images from many of the 400-plus national park units, this striking collection is comprehensive and inspiring. The National Parks: An American Legacy reveals the way humankind interacts with the parks, and how the story of the national parks is also a tribute to the people who visit, explore, and tirelessly work to preserve these cherished American landscapes.""--provided by publisher.

Ten years ago he was taking photos of two of his grandchildren in a water park in Oregon, and as an experiment, he took a few photos of a fountain at very high speed (1/4000th) and with a long focal length (400mm) (the first two can be found in this book). He was surprised and pleased by the results, and since then has been taking photos of fountains whenever he could. Some of his best are in this book, each accompanied by quotations about water by authors and poets throughout the ages, ranging from Heraclitus to Conan Doyle to Philip Larkin to Yoko Ono.--amazon.com.

Traveling around the world--to settings ranging from forest to savannah to the polar seas to the great coral reefs--Flach has constructed a powerful visual record of remarkable animals and ecosystems facing harsh challenges. Among them are primates coping with habitat loss, big cats in a losing battle with human settlements, elephants hunted for their ivory, and numerous bird species taken as pets. With eminent zoologist Jonathan Baillie providing insightful commentary on this ambitious project, Endangered unfolds as a series of vivid, interconnected stories that pose gripping moral dilemmas, unforgettably expressed by more than 180 of Flach's incredible images.

The series Bodies of Work focuses on the Linz shipyard ÖSWAG. Camera in hand Gruzei accompanied the construction of a large ferry over a period of two months. Man and machine are seen to be perfectly attuned to each other in the industrial production process. Gruzei views the ""working body"" in this context as a ""site for the negotiation of the always topical discourse on the place accorded to work and the changes taking place within it"". The artist took photographs also at times when the shipyard was not in operation. As darkness settled on the premises and the noise of the machines died down, motifs began to appear in a different light altogether. The defamiliarized appearance of the scenery leads away from a specific segment of represented reality to novel aspects of time and space. The photographic impact of this series therefore goes far beyond a purely documentary approach.""--Lentos Kunstmusuem Linz website: Exhibitions>Reviews>Katharina Gruzei (viewed on December 21, 2018).

By amplifying the abstract tendencies of New Vision in a lyrical mode evincing great sensitivity, he was able to overcome the prevailing realist aesthetic in American photography. Callahan was one of the few innovators of modern American photography noted as much for his work in color as for his work in black and white. The exhibition catalog presents Callahan's multifaceted photographic œuvre, the product of tireless and prolific creative labors over the course of nearly sixty years. With nearly 200 works it shows the entire spectrum of Callahan's production, including the rarely shown color works. The works come from the Estate of Harry Callahan, Courtesy Pace / MacGill Gallery, New York, and from the F. C. Gundlach Collection, Hamburg""--Publisher's website.

William Gedney,Gilles Mora,photography,First published in 2017,/works/OL19720118W,/authors/OL542575A/Gilles_Mora,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 159,"Mysterious, introspective, fiercely private, and self-taught, street photographer William Gedney (1932-1989) produced impressive series of images focused on people whose lives were overlooked, hidden, or reduced to stereotypes. He was convinced that photography was a means of expression as efficient as literature, and his images were accompanied by writings, essays, excerpts from books, and aphorisms. Gedney avoided self-promotion, and his underrepresented work was largely unknown during his short lifetime. He died at the age of fifty-six from AIDS. 'William Gedney: Only the Lonely, 1955-1984' is the first comprehensive retrospective of his photography.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These sightings include bucolically littered locations such as the Niagara River Gorge (where many a cart has been pushed to its untimely death) and mundane settings that look suspiciously like a suburb near you.  Working in the naturalist's tradition, the photographs depict the diversity of the phenomenon and carry a surprising emotional charge; readers inevitably begin to see these carts as human, at times poignant in their abandoned, decrepit state, hilariously incapacitated, or ingeniously co-opted. The result is at once rigorous and absurd, enabling the layperson to identify and classify their own cart spottings based on the situation in which they were found.

A first visit in 1982 introduced Ghirri to Puglia's whitewashed streets, luminescent nights, doorways and arches, potted cacti, funfairs, and beaches, as well as a group of artists, critics, and curators who would become his close friends and collaborators. Over the following decade, Ghirri returned to the area almost every year, photographing, exhibiting, and deepening his understanding of its subtle terrain. These photographs, almost all of which are little-known and previously unpublished, capture the textures and rhythms of urban life, delighting in visual coincidence and tactile detail. Their sense of quiet discovery - and the colour film on which they are shot - allude warmly to the area's identity as a popular holiday destination. Ghirri maps the Apulian territory via the traces left by its inhabitants and visitors in images flooded with the distinctive light of Southern Italy - the bright sun and its eloquent shadows, and the otherworldly aura of neon and streetlights after dark. With texts by Adele Ghirri and Arturo Carlo Quintavalle.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die Photographie ist ein unentbehrliches Instrument der Wissenschaft, der Technik, der Werbung, der Presse und aller möglichen Arbeitsgebiete geworden. Sie dient aber such der Verschönerung des Lebens, dem frohen Erfassen und Genießen der Herrlichkeiten der Landschaft und der Kunst, und dem intimeren Lebenskreis der Familie und der Freundschaft. Die Ausstellung von Luzern ist dazu berufen, diese hohe wirtschaftliche, wissenschaftliche und kulturelle Bedeutung des Lichtbildes zu offenbaren und seine starke technische und künstlerische Entwicklung ins Bewußtsein zu rufen. Ich wünsche der Veranstaltung besten Erfolg.    Mes meilleurs vœux accompagnent l'Exposition mondiale de la Photographie à Lucerne. La photographie est devenue un instrument indispensable de la science et de la technique, de la publicité et de la presse et de bien d'autres activités encore. En outre, elle contribue à l'embellissement de la vie, elle aide à la saine intelligence et à jouir des merveilles de la nature et de l'art et seconde le cercle intime de la vie familiale et de l'amitié. L'exposition de Lucerne est appelée à souligner l'importance du rôle économique, scientifique et culturel de la photographie et à attirer l'attention sur l'importance de son développement technique et artistique. Je souhaite le plus complet succès à cette manifestation.    My best wishes go to the World Exhibition of Photography at Lucerne. Photography has become an indispensable instrument to science, technics, propaganda, press and almost every sort of work. At the same time it helps to embellish life, aids to happy understanding and enjoyment of the beauties of landscape and art, as well as the more intimate sphere of family life  and friendship. The Lucerne Exhibition is verily qualified to demonstrate the high commercial, scientific and cultural importance of the photographic picture and to accentuate its specific technical and artistic development. May this show be a successful one.    Phillip Etter,     Bundesrat     conseiller fédéral     Member of the Federal Council   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dravidian catharsis,Yannick Cormier,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL32026207W,/authors/OL11617681A/Yannick_Cormier,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Le Mulet editions|Language French|Pages 220,"In Tamil Nadu, in southern India, the most remote and ancient traditions have remained intact more than anywhere else. The powerful presences of spirits and living gods are incarnated under the masks, in the bodies which abandon themselves at the time of the rite and in the animal remains during the sacrifices. Characters of whom we no longer know if they are men, gods or spirits, arise in their obviousness, real and divine, natural and supernatural. Men and women in a trance sink into darkness into full light; they do not belong to them, they are collective, staged or free. Individual psychology gives way to a large common body that vibrates in unison. ""For fifteen years, I have multiplied festivals and rituals, stubbornly turning my back on the polite universe of orthodox Hinduism in well-known religious India. Facing me: veneration, ecstasy, rage or reverie, so many variations around the human figure in what it makes unique on the rest of the living.I wanted to give a look at the secular heritage of India today, closer to my imagination than to the documentary. My photographic work thus mixes frontal portraits, scenes taken on the spot and staged, with the aim of suggesting rather than describing.I have sought in the daily life lived from the inside, a meaning that goes beyond the anecdotal. I thus absorbed each of the individual stories, sharing the daily life of those who placed their trust in me in the closed ritual space. Inevitably, the border between distance and intimacy made uncertain, but fully assumed, my initiate position ale of mere spectator."" 'Dravidian Catharsis' is the fruit of this deep immersion in the culture, the theater, the traditions, and in the soul of this mythological universe of the Tamil people. An artist's vision, both brutal and poetic  Au Tamil Nadu, dans le sud de l'Inde, les traditions les plus lointaines et les plus anciennes sont restées intactes plus que nulle part ailleurs. Les puissantes présences des esprits et des dieux vivants s'incarnent sous les masques, dans les corps qui s'abandonnent au moment du rite et dans les dépouilles animales lors des sacrifices. Des personnages dont on ne sait plus s'ils sont des hommes, des dieux ou des esprits, surgissent dans leur évidence, réels et divins, naturels et surnaturels. Des hommes et des femmes en transe s'enfoncent dans les ténèbres en pleine lumière ; elles ne leur appartiennent pas, elles sont collectives, mises en scène ou libres. La psychologie individuelle laisse place à un grand corps commun qui vibre à l'unisson. ""Pendant quinze ans, j'ai multiplié festivals et rituels, tournant obstinément le dos à l'univers poli de l'hindouisme orthodoxe de l'Inde religieuse bien connu. Face à moi : vénération, extase, rage ou rêverie, autant de variations autour de la figure humaine dans ce qu'elle a d'unique sur le reste du vivant. J'ai voulu donner un regard sur l'héritage séculaire de l'Inde d'aujourd'hui, plus proche de mon imaginaire que du documentaire. Mon travail photographique mêle ainsi portraits frontaux, scènes prises sur le vif et mises en scène, avec pour finalité l'envie de suggérer plutôt que de décrire. J'ai cherché dans le quotidien vécu de l'intérieur, un sens qui dépasse l'anecdotique. Je m'imprégnais ainsi de chacune des histoires individuelles, partageant le quotidien de ceux qui m'accordaient leur confiance dans le huis clos de l'espace rituel. Inévitablement, la frontière entre distance et intimité rendait incertaine, mais pleinement assumée, ma position initiale de simple spectateur.""

In his picture arrangements he deals with various topics and picture materials, which can either originate from the museum context or depictions of everyday advertising brochures. Themes of showing, indicating, elevating and uncovering are always important for his choice of subjects. In so doing, Ingo Mittelstaedt explores in a humorous and enigmatic manner the possibilities and limits of the medium photography in his works. Mittelstaedt has already had numerous institutional exhibitions. In 2009/2010 he was awarded the 'gute aussichten - junge deutsche fotografie' prize; 2015 he received the New York-Scholarship from the Niedersächsische Sparkassenstiftung and the Land of Lower Saxony.

He uses fire prevention spaces between high-rise buildings or closing garage doors for small interventions that he always performs himself. In this combination of performance and photography he enacts absurd movements that contradict the predefined urban order. By repeating exactly the same movements in different places, his photographs and videos come to focus less on the need for order in urban spaces and more on their potential for individual and idiosyncratic action. Stumpf's camera angles are very precise compositions of urban arrangements, to which he adds his personal performative elements. He sets his actions against the purely factual gaze of the camera.00Exhibition: Museum of Contemporary Art Guangzhou, China (08.12.2019 - 23.02.2020).

While best known as a founding member of the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, Nash also developed a parallel career as a photographer, collector, and digital imaging pioneer. Inspired by his father, Nash began taking pictures at the age of 11. Spanning the years 1953 to 2000, the photographs in Eye to Eye include revealing portraits of family and friends, images of life on the road, still lifes and landscapes, street photographs, and a unique series of self-portraits in which Nash is often reflected in windows and mirrors."" ""In 1971, Nash began collecting photographs, and by the late 1980s he had built one of the most important collections in private hands, including more than 2,400 prints by both early photographers and modern masters of the medium. In 1990, he sold his collection at auction and invested the income from the sale in Nash Editions, the first fine-art digital printmaking studio in the world. In 1998, a traveling exhibition, Digital Frontiers: Photography's Future at Nash Editions, was organized by the George Eastman House International Museum of Photography in Rochester, New York.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Photography as a means of capturing the real world at first seemed to obviate the need for painting. Later, impressionists, cubists, and eventually abstract painters moved away from figurative imagery, until artists such as Richter or Polke transferred photography back into painting.00These conflicting challenges are at the heart of Berit Schneidereit?s work, who creates hybrids through ?analog? editing of digital images and joins together photographic methods with techniques used in painting, graphic art, and collage. Schneidereit mostly takes photographs in botanical gardens. In the darkroom, she then superimposes a grid or net-like structure over her motifs, which become blurred, ambiguous, and hazy. The artist thus achieves something that is close to painting once again. Like invisible curtains, her manipulations distort or obscure our view of the real image.00Her work in this way questions the relationship between visibility and invisibility (also as a result of the media) and illustrates how the visual media, that are available today, force themselves between our gaze and the world.

Als ""Spectator"" des Buchs kann man die Augen durch wechselnde Perspektiven und teils irreale Schauplätze wandern lassen und eine parallele, surreal anmutende Existenz von ikonischen Gebäuden entdecken. er fotografiert den Fernsehbildschirm, nutzt Ausschnitte von Werbung, verfremdet und manipuliert durch Beschneiden, den Einsatz von Farbfiltern und durch Hinzufügen von geometrischen Mustern. This is a photo series focussing on fame and strength. The artist's documentary style meets various kinds of stages and light plays, making the reader a spectator of the book that follows the changing perspectives and wanders through sometimes surreal scenes, discovering parallel existences of iconic buildings. Gottman photographs TV monitors, uses extracts of advertising, alienating them by cutting, usage of filters or addition of patterns.

His work occupies a unique historical position thanks to his visual language, technical prowess and use of natural light. As one of the most important photographers of the New Building movement, Mantz's oeuvre bridges the gap between the often-anonymous nature of commissioned photography and the modernistƯ, artistic avant-garde movements of the interwar years, such as the Bauhaus. In the 1970s, Mantz was even hailed as the 'missing link' in the history of international photography. To date, only thematic selections from Mantz's wide-ranging oeuvre have been exhibited. This monograph sets the record straight by showcasing, for the very first time, his immense versatility. Werner Mantz ? The Perfect Eye contains over 300 predominantly vintage images, ranging from architectural photography, advertising shots and portraits of adults and children, to views of industry and mines, religious subjects, shops, restaurants and interiors, as well as roads, public spaces, landscapes and travel photographs. That Mantz's oeuvre belongs to the canon of international photography is indisputable.00Exhibition: Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht, The Netherlands (25.09.2022 - 26.02.2023).

Ihr Blick gilt öffentlichen, meist urbanen Räumen wie Straßen und Plätzen, in denen sie den Wandel der Ereignisse aufzeichnet. Die weltweit entstehenden Aufnahmen zeigen den Einfluss der Zeit auf die Wahrnehmung und die Dynamisierung des statischen Bildraums. Zeit drückt sich in Bewegung aus, und die energetische Kraft des Lichts wird zum zentralen Motiv. Gudrun Kemsas Arbeiten schließen die Betrachter als Subjekte der Betrachtung ein und bewegen sie zu einer aktiven Form der Rezeption. 0Der Katalog zur Ausstellung dokumentiert Gudrun Kemsas neu entwickelte Videoserie mit dem Titel?Moving Portraits? und die gleichnamige Serie an großformatigen Fotografien. Sie?begleitet? dabei Salzburger Kulturschaffende wie die Festspielpräsidentin Helga Rabl-Stadler, den Abt vom St. Peter, Korbinian Birnbacher, die Leiterin der Mozart-Museen Gabriele Ramsauer und andere durch ihre Institution.0""Das plötzliche Gefühl, sich selbst zu bewegen, schärft die Aufmerksamkeit auf das Bezugssystem von filmischem und realem Raum, relativiert das Bewusstsein der eigenen Präsenz im tatsächlichen Raum und der realen Zeit und betont schließlich die Körperlichkeit des Sehens.""

Dieses Buch nimmt erstmals diese Aufnahmen in den Fokus und zeichnet nach, welche Rolle der Industrie und den Fabriken in den Bildwelten des Zarenreichs zugedacht war. Industriefotografien eröffneten Außenstehenden einen Blick hinter russische Fabriktore. Damit prägten sie in Alben, Fest und Zeitschriften sowie auf Postkarten das Bild von Fabriken in der russischen Gesellschaft. An den Schnittstellen von Fotografie, Industrie, Technik und visueller Geschichte analysiert die Autorin erstmals, wie sich die Industriefotografie im Zarenreich entwickelte und welche Botschaften über Industrialisierung und Fabriken die an der Herstellung und Verbreitung der neuen Bilder beteiligten Akteure mit den Aufnahmen vermittelten. Vergleiche mit Studien aus Frankreich, Deutschland, Großbritannien und den USA stellen die russische Fabrikfotografie in einen größeren Kontext und verdeutlichen, dass weniger von einer nationalen als von einer europäisch/nordamerikanischen Bildsprache gesprochen werden muss.

His work in the early 1980s prompted photographers like Martin Parr to switch to color, and a new style of photography soon evolved in the works of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Simon Norfolk, Jem Southam and many others. Since then, Graham has continued to push the envelope, demonstrating a commitment to expanding photography's artistic space, and to the unity of documentary and artistic considerations in an unblinking engagement with life as it unfolds. Today, he ranks alongside figures like Nan Goldin, Andreas Gursky, Philip-Lorca diCorcia and Rineke Djikstra as a precursor and an eminence. Graham's most recent volume, A Shimmer of Possibility (published in 2007 and already a collector's item - and available below in a new paperback edition), was hailed by critics as a paradigm shifter at a time when art photography is increasingly staged or seems to hold the world at arm's length. This volume, which coincides with a touring European retrospective, appraises 25 years of Graham's work, from 1981 to 2006, tracking his steady expansion of our notions of what photography can say, be or look like.""--BOOK JACKET.

Since its invention, the automobile has reshaped our landscape, extended our geographic horizons and radically altered our conception of space and time, influencing the practice of photographers worldwide. The book shows how the car provided photographers with new subject matter and a new way of exploring the world. Capturing formal qualities such as the geometric design of roadways or reflections in a rear view mirror, photographers invite us to look at the world of the automobile in a new way. Autophoto also includes other projects, such as a series of car models that cast a fresh eye on the history of automobile design, created specifically for the Fondation Cartier show by French artist Alain Bublex, plus a comparative history of automobile design and photography, essays by scholars and quotes by participating artists.""--Adapted from seller description.

Indem er vorhandenes Material mit einer vorgefundenen Situation verknüpft, überführt er eine bestimmte Situation aus dem Leben in den Kunstkontext.    Durch den Austausch und fließenden Übergang zwischen Museumsinventar und Privatbesitz, zwischen Museum, Wohnung, Baumarkt und Einrichtungshaus, sind    Slotawas Arrangements sowohl Ausstellungsobjekt wie auch Alltagsgegenstand. Sie bewegen sich in ständiger Zirkulation zwischen Öffentlichkeit, Markt und Privatsphäre, lösen überkommene Besitzverhältnisse auf und stellen diese damit in Frage. Anlass für die vorliegende Monografie war das Projekt Solothurn, aussen, bei dem er die Skulpturen im Park des Kunstmuseums Solothurn für die Dauer von mehreren Monaten versetzte und zu einer neuen skulpturalen Anordnung verdichtete. Sabine Rusterholz kommentiert die Solothurner Arbeit, Andreas Fiedler interviewt den Künstler.    Das Buch bietet eine Werkübersicht der Jahre 2002 bis 2008.

Starting with a powerful reinterpretation of one of the most famous photos of all time, Alfred Eisenstaedt's image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square on V-J Day, Alexander Nemerov goes on to examine an idiosyncratic collection of mostly obscure or unknown images and movie episodes--from a photo of Jimmy Stewart and Olivia de Havilland lying on a picnic blanket in the Santa Barbara hills to scenes from such films as Twelve O'Clock High and Hold Back the Dawn. Erotically charged and bearing traces of trauma even when they seem far removed from the war, these photos and scenes seem to hold out the promise of a palpable and emotional connection to those years. Through a series of fascinating stories, Nemerov reveals the surprising background of these bits of film and discovers unexpected connections between the war and Hollywood, from an obsession with aviation to Anne Frank's love of the movies. Beautifully written and illustrated, Wartime Kiss vividly evokes a world in which Margaret Bourke-White could follow a heroic assignment photographing a B-17 bombing mission over Tunis with a job in Hollywood documenting the filming of a war movie. Ultimately this is a book about history as a sensuous experience, a work as mysterious, indescribable, and affecting as a novel by W. G. Sebald""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Philip Jones Griffiths' classic account of the war was the outcome of three years reporting, and is one of the most detailed surveys of any conflict. Showing us the true horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese folk life, the author creates a compelling argument against the de-humanizing power of technology, and highlights the arrogance and hypocrisy of American imperialistic attitudes. Rare and highly sought-after, the book has become one of the enduring classics of photo- journalism. This new edition is a careful recreation of the original, with Philip Jones Griffiths' personal layouts and commentaries, and includes a foreword by Noam Chomsky, who was profoundly affected by the book when it was originally published and now pays tribute to its power and importance in the new edition.

His debut book of poems, Nomadic? Rover by Days Singing These Gang Plank Songs of the Ambler, reflects the intense and unguarded energy of a vital artist and natural storyteller who has deep connections to both historic and current movements. His subject matter ranges from childhood memories of racial inequality to contemporary ideas of gender fluidity, and his absurd ditties tickle the what the fuck bone in all of us. Littered amongst the poems are moments of prose and snippets of email exchanges between Merrill and his editor, Jeanette Powers. But perhaps the most dynamic aspect of this book is the inclusion of Merrill's original drawings and handwritten notes, which occupy the space around the poems: visual expansions from the poet’s haptic nonce of a squirrelly soul.

Thomas Struth is one of the best-known photographers to come out of the school of Bernd and Hilla Becher. In this celebrated volume, Struth presents a series of urban streetscapes from cities such as Edinburgh, Lima, Pyongyang, Naples, and New York City, all taken in similar conditions--devoid of human activity. Struth refers to these mundane buildings, unpopulated streets and anonymous facades as ""unconscious places""--environments that are imbued with meaning only by the viewer. Captured with exquisite technical prowess and presented with powerful, restrained neutrality, Struth's images allow us to fully appreciate a city's character--from its telephone wires above to the pavement below. Renowned sociologist Richard Sennett's illuminating essay reveals how Struth's sober, lucid photography leads the viewer to create their own conclusions, rather than forcing a perspective. The resulting interplay among photographer, viewer, and landscape may hold the key to understanding how architecture affects our daily lives.

Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest... Chaque jour, des millions d'internautes n'hésitent pas à se raconter en images. Le numérique et les smartphones ont démocratisé une technique qui n'est plus réservée seulement à la presse ou à la publicité. Même les expositions, dans les musées comme dans les galeries, attirent de plus en plus de monde. De Niépce, l'inventeur de la photographie, à Photoshop, célèbre logiciel de retouche, en passant par Avedon et Penn, camera obscura, Cartier- Bresson, Kodak ou encore selfie, Pierre-Jean Amar nous donne quelques clés pour comprendre la photographie, son histoire et ses techniques, mais aussi des conseils pour réussir nos clichés. En photo- graphe reconnu et proche de Willy Ronis, dont il a réalisé les tirages, il illustre un art qui dépend finalement moins de la qualité de l'objectif que de la qualité du regard.

In The Art of Black and White Photography author and photographer Torsten Andreas Hoffmann takes a different approach, focusing on image composition and image capture, with an emphasis on the creative aspects of black and white photography rather than on the digital workflow.  After introducing the ground rules of composition, Hoffmann illustrates their applications with his own stunning black and white images that cover various photographic genres, including architecture, street photography, portraiture, and surreal photography. Also discussed are the elements of a ""photographic language""', which distinguishes creative photography from random shooting.

While Thomas Ruff, Andreas Gursky and Jörg Sasse have gradually adopted digital imaging tools in the early 1990s, other photographers from the Düsseldorf School have remained faithful to film-based technologies. By evaluating the aesthetic and discursive preconditions of this situation and by extensively analyzing the digital work of these three photographers, this book shows that the digital turn in photography was anticipated by the conceptualization of images within systems, and thus offers new perspectives for understanding the »digital revolution«.

He began by recording the pastimes and customs of his wealthy Parisian milieu, indulging his fascination with sports and aviation, and throughout his long life he was never without his camera.  His friendships extended to the superstars of French culture, but he also made thousands of photographs of his family, wives and lovers.  His work was irresistibly warm and engaging.  Although known for his black-and-white work, Lartigue loved color film, experimenting with the Autochrome process in the teens and twenties and embracing Ektachrome in the late 1940s.  His color work, reproduced here for the first time, is astonishingly fresh: the French countryside, the women in his life, famous friends (Picasso, Fellini) and glimpses from his travels all come alive in this delightful book.

Now selected images from thirty years of photographic work previously unknown to the public come to light in Marcus Reichert: The Human Edifice by critic and art historian Mel Gooding. As Gooding says of Reichert’s photographs: “These are what pierce, these visual facts: traces of the actual that compose themselves into the dignity and beauty of the abstract, are propositions of a new reality.”  Mel Gooding has contributed extensively to the art press, and his books include monographs on Gillian Ayres, Bruce McLean, Patrick Heron, John Hoyland, and Ceri Richards. On architecture and public spaces, he has written William Alsop: Buildings and Projects, Joze Plecnik National and University Library, Ljubljana, and Public: Art: Space. His Abstract Art, written for the Tate Gallery, is essential reading for anyone seriously interested in the subject and his Song of the Earth: European Artists and the Landscape is a defining work.

His father had an obsession in his final days: he was, he said, not leaving anything for what he would be remembered for. Then Weber, instinctively, began to document those last moments. He asked his father to collaborate with his portraits. He somehow wanted to keep him alive. The video is the last register of the time they shared. The book also gathers drawings, texts, portraits, songs and video-stills from Skype as a place of reflection, memory, family love and generational transcendence. This filial testimony, although personal, can be understood better than ever by any of us because of the central place that technology has in our daily lives during this pandemic. It is the bridge that allows closeness and day-to-day life, despite the distance, with our family, sentimental and working bonds, or to say it simply, with our previous life. --Publisher webpage.

Sonata,Aaron Schuman,photography,First published in 2022,/works/OL31870238W,/authors/OL8093787A/Aaron_Schuman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  MACK|Language English|Pages 128,"""SONATA is an extensive body of photographic work made by Aaron Schuman in Italy over the past four years. Rather than attempting to capture and convey an objective reality, these images are consciously filtered through the many ideas, fascinations, and fantasies associated with the country and what it has represented in the imaginations of those countless travellers who have visited it over the course of centuries. Drawing inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Italian Journey (1786-1788), Schuman pursues and studies what Goethe described as 'sense-impressions', reiterating many of the introspective questions that Goethe asked himself during his own travels through Italy: 'In putting my powers of observation to the test, I have found a new interest in life...Can I learn to look at things with clear, fresh eyes? How much can I take in at a single glance? Can the grooves of old mental habits be effaced?' The resulting images are curious, quizzical, and entrancingly atmospheric, conveying a foreigner's sensitivity to details, quirks, and mysteries: cracks that spider across ancient statues and museum walls, paths that have been shaped and trodden over millennia, the piercing eyes and looming presence of saints and gods all around, accumulations of dust, bones, sunlight, and lucky pennies. Using the classical sonata form - three movements moving through exposition, development, and recapitulation - as a guide, Schuman invites us to explore an Italy as much of the mind as of the world: one soaked in the euphoria and terror, harmony and dissonance of its cultural and historical legacies, and yet constantly new, invigorating, and resonant in its sensorial and psychological suggestions.""--Publisher description.

Son también muchos los libros dedicados a prestar ayuda al aficionado; pero, a nuestro entender, unos pecan de excesivamente técnicos o voluminosos, y otros de demasiado parcos y concretos, lo cual exige su adquisición «a docenas» y esto echa por tierra la pretendida economía de los mismos.  Por otra parte, la técnica fotográfica ha realizado tales progresos en los últimos tiempos que el aficionado necesita una obra rigurosamente puesta al día.  Tal es el objetivo que persigue la Fotoenciclopedia Daimon y su división en tres volúmenes, y nada más que tres, todos ellos además totalmente independientes y adaptados a las tres distintas necesidades o etapas del aficionado, obedecen al deseo de prestar a éste el más eficaz servicio en cada una de ellas.  En efecto, la primera etapa corresponde al más correcto empleo del aparato fotográfico, desde su elección y manejo, hasta los últimos detalles de la toma de vistas. Hay muchos que se limitan a esto y dejan a cargo del laboratorio todo lo demás.  En este aspecto, el volumen primero, subtitulado Fotografía en blanco y negro, pone al alcance del lector todo cuanto es preciso conocer sobre óptica fotográfica, estudia las propiedades de los diferentes materiales sensibles y analiza de un modo práctico y sencillo la mejor técnica para realizar toda clase de tomas de vista con luz natural...

Each of his series focuses on a different facet of the growth and transformation of the urban landscape-- from studies of architectural maquettes to the extraction and use of natural materials such as limestone, as it is quarried via explosive blasts and subsequently incorporated into the construction of new buildings. In particular, Hatakeyama has routinely returned to the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolis, exploring this ever-evolving urban sprawl from both below and above, mapping the growth and expansion of these sites over time. Additional series focus on other forms of human intervention with the landscape and natural materials, including factories and building sites in Japan and abroad. Finally, his most recent photographs of his hometown of Rikuzentakata, a fishing town that was almost completely destroyed by the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, are also included-- an ongoing series begun almost immediately following the disaster. These photographs hauntingly embody the death and rebirth of the city, manifesting a deeply personal connection to the ongoing intersection of geology, architecture, and time.

An abandoned vacation house, set in the center of rolling fields and trees becomes the cottage home of her dreams... a French country style cottage filled with original elements and an exquisite mix of rustic and refined. The years of renovation allowed Courtney to create a lifestyle that is fueled by inspiration  & beauty, a touch of whimsy, and an abundance of everyday elegance. The journey has been shared on her popular blog French Country Cottage, and now, through the publication of her first book, her readers will experience a reveal of more of her home and property and the inspirations behind her beloved style. Courtney's inspiring photography reveals every nuance of her style and home including a muted color palette, old brassy door knobs, chippy paint, antiques, her greenhouse and garden- and an abundance of entertaining and holiday decorating style.  Blurring the lines between indoor and outdoors and embracing well worn as well loved, French Country Cottage is a style that celebrates simplicity, indulges in romance, cherishes pieces with history and believes a chandelier and fresh flowers belong in every room.""--Amazon.

Carefully planned images are mixed with stream-of-consciousness texts, while a poetic approach emerges through allegories, personal stories, and pairs of images. Her project deals with the rampant individualism that underpins our contemporary social, political, and economic system, and in particular, the environmental impact this has. Geibl takes the viewer on an associative journey where there are no clear answers but instead ambiguous questions. Her storytelling approach aims to guide these themes towards a deeper exploration of the rapid changes around us.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When asked 'Where did you travel to in 1971' - he had an answer within ten minutes; all he had to do was look up his 1971 diary. It's fascinating, and sometimes laughable? in our holiday home in France, for example, I came across a drawer full of booklets: all the instructions for use of all the rubber boats that we had ever bought. The idea for our joint column certainly arose during a drink. We immediately knew what it had to be: two visions on one theme. His photo, my text, separate from each other, each our story, and together a little bit more. Something the newspaper reader should think about. Why this photo with this piece? Ah! It could be about anything, we would hand each other subjects. And that's how we do it too. The photos go straight through time, the subjects are contemporary - imperceptibly more topicality has crept in than we expected."" Every two weeks, 'de Volkskrant' publishes an image column of Eva and Eddy Posthuma de Boer. Eva's texts are combined with an image from Eddy's rich archive, each time yields a gem.The texts and images are now bundled in 'Mosquitoes & elephants'  Eddy bewaart echt alles, zijn studio is een levend monument. Op de vraag 'Waar reisde je in 1971 naartoe' - had hij binnen tien minuten antwoord; hij hoefde er alleen even zijn agenda uit 1971 op na te slaan. Het is fascinerend, en soms lachwekkend ? zo kwam ik in ons vakantiehuis in Frankrijk een la vol boekjes tegen: alle gebruiksaanwijzingen van alle rubberboten die we ooit hadden gekocht. Het idee voor onze gezamenlijke column ontstond geheid tijdens een borrel. We wisten meteen wat het moest worden: twee visies op één thema. Zijn foto, mijn tekst, los van elkaar, ieder ons verhaal, en samen een schepje erbovenop. Iets waar de krantenlezer even over zou moeten nadenken. Waarom deze foto bij dit stukje? Ah! Het mocht over alles gaan, we zouden elkaar onderwerpen aanreiken. En dat is ook hoe we het doen. De foto's gaan dwars door de tijd, de onderwerpen zijn van nu - ongemerkt is er meer actualiteit in geslopen dan we hadden verwacht.""0Iedere twee weken publiceert 'de Volkskrant' een beeldcolumn van Eva en Eddy Posthuma de Boer. De teksten van Eva gecombineerd met een beeld uit het rijke archief van Eddy leveren iedere keer weer een juweeltje op.

Success in photojournalism is predicated on having a firm understanding of the business. Conceiving of a suitable reportage concept and getting a technically sound image may seem a simple task for photographers well-versed in photographing other subjects, but the truth is, photojournalism requires a special skill-set and understanding of what it is that such jobs entail. In this book, you'll learn what to shoot, how to shoot it, how and where to socialize and determine cultural basics that may impact how and what you can photograph, how to get your images onto editors' desks and in front of the eyes of the wider world audience, and how to make sales.

Provoke is accordingly treated here as a model synthesis of the complexities and overlapping uses of photography in postwar Japan. The writing and images by Provoke's members -- critic Koji Taki, poet Takahiko Okada, photographers Takuma Nakahira, Yutaka Takanashi, Daido Moriyama -- were suffused with the tactics developed in some Japanese protest books which made use of innovative graphic design and provocatively ""poor"" materials. Recording live actions, photography in these years was also an expressive form suited to emphasize and critique the mythologies of modern life with a wide spectrum of performing artists such as Nobuyoshi Araki, Koji Enokura and Jiro Takamatsu. This catalogue accompanies the first exhibition ever to be held about the magazine and its creators and focuses on its historical context. It covers the preliminary period leading to its first and the aftermath following its last issue. Provoke takes shape as a strongly interpretative explanation of currents in Japanese art and society at a moment of historical collapse and renewal.

Ranging from a period of fifty-six years and counting, these images are representative of the photographer's color career. Assignments from various magazines (Vogue, National Geographic, Life magazine) and commercial projects led him to photograph fashion (early 1960s), the Shah of Iran with his family (1964), keepers of French monuments (1988), the supermodel Kylie Bax (1997), and college cheerleaders (1989). He photographed in India and China, but also at home in New York, in Chicago, and along the Pacific Coast Highway. In 1968, Michelangelo Antonioni invited him to document the making of his film Zabriskie Point. Davidson also continued to pursue personal projects, e.g. photographing the Yiddish writer and Nobel Prize laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer (1972-75), the New York City subway (1980), and Katz's Delicatessen (2004). Often staying on in a country after an official assignment, he documented Welsh coalfields, family holidays in Martha's Vineyard, and travelled through Patagonia and Mexico.""--From publisher's website.

Her work describes a world that is visceral, charged, and seething with life. First published in 1986, this reissue recognizes the persistent relevance and freshness of Nan Goldin's cutting-edge photography. Her lush color photography and candid style demand that the viewer go beyond the surface to encounter a profound intensity. As Goldin writes: ""Real memory, which these pictures trigger, is an invocation of the color, smell, sound, and physical presence, the density and flavor of life."" Through an accurate and detailed record of her life, Ballad reveals Goldin's personal odyssey as well as a more universal understanding of the different languages men and women speak, and the struggle between autonomy and dependency. Over the past twenty-five years, the influence of Ballad on photography and other aesthetic realms has continually grown, making the work a contemporary classic. Nan Goldin's story of urban life on the fringe was the swan song of an era that reached its peak in the early eighties. Yet it has captured an important element of humanity that is transcendent: a need to connect"".--Bokk jacket.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

L'ouvrage publié à l'occasion de cette exposition réunit quatre-vingts photographies de natures très diverses, qui ont en commun d'avoir été prises dans le territoire parisien. Le livre est constitué de séquences qui alternent des vues proches et lointaines. Proche et lointain qualifient à la fois une géographie et une biographie. Patrick Faigenbaum, parisien de naissance, vit encore dans la capitale. Les lieux les plus proches sont ceux de l'intimité familiale : entre autres un extraordinaire ensemble de portraits de la mère de l'artiste, des vues du quai de la Loire... Le lointain biographique est présenté dans un prologue qui rassemble, sous le titre ""1972 - Rue Michel-Chasles"", les images les plus anciennes de l'artiste, restées inédites jusqu'à ce jour. Le lointain géographique se distribue selon les quatre points cardinaux du territoire métropolitain que l'artiste a arpenté au printemps 2011 (Montreuil, Nanterre, Saint-Denis, Rungis, Saint-Germain-en-Laye...).""--P.

It contained a variety of models from Dallas, Texas with him taking special time finding the photographs representing his perception of the Dallas People.  Later he did on called ""New York Nude"".  I fortunately was one selected to be the All American type Young Male.  My two picture spread took two full pages containing the two pictures.  Various none models did many varied pictures of Art work of the human body.  When I told my mother and family about me doing it, before it's big release I was amazed at my mom's reaction.

Too this date I still wish I had a copy, but you cannot replace a copy of the one I had, it was signed by most of the models. The book opened was a great living room table stand conversation piece.  Mr. Collum did great work, I have to commend him on that.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hij zegt er zelf over: Wie zijn deze mensen die alles over hebben voor hun vak? Als je ergens in het midden van een theaterzaal zit en naar een dansvoorstelling kijkt, zie je bewegende lichamen. De dansers zijn bijna anoniem, voor een buitenstaander inwisselbaar. Ik laat dansers van heel dichtbij zien. Terwijl ze dansen en improviseren, buiten in de natuur. Terwijl ze doen waar ze zo van houden. Ik leg het moment vast waarop ze zich kwetsbaar opstellen. De dansers die ik gefotografeerd heb zijn veelal studenten en alumni van ArtEZ, bacheloropleiding voor moderne en hedendaagse dans. Ze vormen een zeer diverse groep: vrouwen en mannen met verschillende nationaliteiten, etnische achtergronden en, wat niet altijd vanzelfsprekend is binnen de danswereld, met verschillende lichaamstypes.

Though he has published many smaller monographs of individual bodies of work, this gathers his most iconic images for the first time and brings a fresh perspective to his oeuvre with the inclusion of many unpublished photographs. Well-known for his photographs of landscapes and suburban housing across the United States, and for his use of luminous color, Hido casts a distinctly cinematic eye across all that he photographs, digging deep into his memory and imaginationn for inspiration. David Campany introduces the work and looks specifically at Hido's cinematic influences and the kind of spectatorship the work demands. The book is organized chronologically, showing how his series overlap in exciting, new ways. Also featured are short interviews with Hido about the making of each of his monographs. From exterior to interior, surface observations to subconscious investigations, landscapes to nudes, this mid-career survey reveals insight into Hido?s practice and illustrates how his unique focus has developed and shifted over time.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Faking it,Mia Fineman,photography,First published in 2012,/works/OL19961783W,/authors/OL2769647A/Mia_Fineman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Metropolitan Museum of Art,              Distributed by Yale University Press|Language English|Pages 280","""It is a long-held truism that 'the camera does not lie'. Yet, as Mia Fineman argues in this illuminating volume, that statement contains its own share of untruth. While modern technological innovations, such as Adobe's Photoshop software, have accustomed viewers to more obvious levels of image manipulation, the practice of ""doctoring"" photographs has in fact existed since the medium was invented. In ""Faking It"", Fineman demonstrates that today's digitally manipulated images are part of a continuum that begins with the earliest years of photography, encompassing methods as diverse as overpainting, multiple exposure, negative retouching, combination printing, and photomontage. Among the book's revelations are previously unknown and never before published images that document the acts of manipulation behind two canonical works of modern photography: one blatantly fantastical (Yves Klein's ""Leap into the Void"" of 1960); the other a purportedly unadulterated record of a real place in time (Paul Strand's ""City Hall Park"" of 1915). Featuring 160 captivating pictures created between the 1840s and 1990s in the service of art, politics, news, entertainment, and commerce, ""Faking It"" provides an essential counterhistory of photography as an inspired blend of fabricated truths and artful falsehoods.""--Publisher's website.

Now he presents the culmination of a career-long endeavor, an extraordinary body of work in which each image is more striking and powerful than the last. Just as did Flach's highly acclaimed previous books, Equus and Dogs, More than Human will amaze and inspire, in a constant affirmation of the animal, whether it be rare or common, powerful or defenseless, odd or majestic. The book showcases a menagerie of creatures--pandas, tigers, bats, lions, orangutans, cobras, bullfrogs, chimpanzees, wolves, porcupines, elephants, owls, armadillos, among many others--as they have never been seen before.

The book reveals how much we've come to know about our fascinating world through the pages and unforgettable imagery of National Geographic, and taps key voices from the forefront of ocean and space exploration, climate science, archaeology, mountaineering, and many other disciplines to peer with us over the horizon and see where we are heading in the future.  Organized thematically, chapters focus on major accomplishments in each of the three realms of Earth, Sea, and Sky (featured on the National Geographic flag). Author Mark Collins Jenkins will present the subject matter chronologically, focusing on great leaps forward that dramatically changed our understanding of the planet, from summiting Everest to landing on the moon to discovering Titanic. Sidebars will feature famous names including Jared Diamond, Sylvia Earle, Buzz Aldrin, Bob Ballard, Jane Goodall and more, contributing thoughts about big questions of exploration, key frontiers in research, and enduring mysteries. We'll ask beloved characters like Zahi Hawass whether or not there's anything left to be discovered in the Valley of the Kings; Paul Sereno if we'll be able to create a dinosaur from DNA; Jared Diamond when society faces the next ""collapse;"" and many more questions designed to be relevant for many years to come.  The focus throughout the book will be on the impact the National Geographic Society has made on the world and how it has reported and reflected a dramatically changing planet, not an insider's account of internal affairs.  Special galleries between each of the sections will focus on storytelling techniques pioneered by National Geographic, including photography, television, and digital reportage. These will offer behind-the-scenes glimpses at the process of telling the greatest stories on earth""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is an impressive mix of technology with just plain good advice for image-taking, and they discuss each point specifically for shooting wildlife, because it is a totally unique type of photography.

Each image alone exposes a nugget of our planet's magnificence; the totality of the collection goes beyond our imagination. Turning the pages, viewers are struck by the richness of life on Earth. One photograph is more awe-inspiring than the next--chosen by veteran National Geographic Magazine photo editors to present what is visually incredible. The photographs are drawn from the popular ""Visions of Earth"" feature in the magazine, (rated #1 by readers), from our own storied Image Collection, and from renowned photographers throughout the world, many never-before published.  Enthralling images fill the book in a gallery of stunning landscapes, fascinating people, amazing animals, and unexpected glimpses of the usual and unusual. Puffins' beaks signal breeding time in Norway and a speckled emperor moth in South Africa diverts predators with an illusion. An elephant takes a morning dip in India's Andaman Sea while Siamese crocodiles race in Thailand and surfers in Australia relish a perfect day. Monks in Bhutan run to dinner and a little girl in red stands out among white-robed women in an Indonesian mosque. Spanish youth decked in colorful, oversize papier-mâche heads celebrate a festival in Catalonia and a flower of flame blooms from a man's kerosene-filled mouth in a Sikh celebration in India.  Around the globe, amazing moments are captured in time, from a spray of flash frozen petal fragments in California to a truck show of chrome-covered and gleaming neon rigs half the world away in Japan. Visions of Earth is a welcome escape from the news of natural disasters, conflict, political upheaval, and social unrest that fills our lives. The book delights our senses, ignites our emotions, and renews our optimism, showcasing the many ways that our world is a marvel to behold and a privilege to call home""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Fotograf Oscar Ellqvist,Oscar Ellqvist,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL31818018W,/authors/OL11564225A/Oscar_Ellqvist,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Staffan Cervin-Ellqvist|Language Swedish|Pages 191,"Oscar Ellqvist was an active photographer in Stockholm from 1893 until the beginning of 1926. He is most often referred to as one of the pioneers in Swedish reportage photography, which he started already in the 1890s. At the Stockholm exhibition in 1897, Oscar was awarded a prize for his snapshots. Oscar was a popular and enterprising photographer who found new opportunities and was early with much of what he undertook. Oscar was the brother of the artist John Bauer's fairytale princess and wife Esther. It is interesting that two of his siblings also worked in the photo and cliché business and that they helped each other. The studio Oscar had the longest was the one in Sparrepalatset at Hamngatan 18. The house was demolished in 1913 when NK was built. The book is richly illustrated with over 150 photographs. The Stockholm motif dominates and we get to meet a now-disappeared city and its inhabitants in topographical images and reportage photos. The text in the book tells about Oscar and his professional life and how some of his siblings worked together with him. There are two digressions about Stockholm around the turn of the century 1900 and the photographer's challenges during this time  Oscar Ellqvist var aktiv fotograf i Stockholm från 1893 fram till början av 1926. Han är mest omtalad som en av pionjärerna inom svensk reportagefotografi som han började med redan på 1890-talet. På Stockholmsutställningen 1897 blev Oscar prisbelönad för sina momentbilder. Oscar var en populär och driftig fotograf som hittade nya möjligheter och var tidig med mycket av det han företog sig.00Oscar var bror till konstnären John Bauers sagoprinsessa och fru Esther. Det är intressant att även två av hans syskon arbetade inom foto och klichébranschen och att de hjälptes åt. Den ateljé Oscar hade längst var den i Sparrepalatset på Hamngatan 18. Huset revs 1913 när NK byggdes. Boken är rikt illustrerad med över 150 fotografier. Stockholmsmotiven dominerar och vi får i topografiska bilder och reportagefoton möta en nu försvunnen stad och dess invånare. Texten i boken berättar om Oscar och hans yrkesliv och hur några av hans syskon arbetade tillsammans med honom. Det görs två utvikningar om Stockholm runt sekelskiftet 1900 och fotografens utmaningar under denna tid.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Removed from today's fast-paced society, she patiently experiences the landscape in a new way, moving beyond initial appearances to gradually uncover the identity of the place, allowing it to impress upon her its specific emotional and physical qualities.

The local,Nick Meyer,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32082389W,/authors/OL6456426A/Nick_Meyer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  MACK|Language English,"Nick Meyer grew up in a small mill town in Western Massachusetts and since his youth the town's terrain has been in flux, with houses and shops continuously erected, razed, and rebuilt in the chasm left by disintegrated industries. The Local documents a town caught between aspiration and decline, a deeply personal account which reveals the struggles, tumult, and everyday life that occur in a place which, from the outside, appears caught in stasis. The experience depicted here is of strangeness and familiarity: the rhythm of change might be recognisable but the parameters have shifted, with opioid addiction and economic crises joining the steady thrum of deindustrialization ...   With the trope of 'left behind' USA now a familiar invocation, Meyer's work offers a uniquely positioned assessment of this figurative non-place, tracing its connections to the particular people and topography of an individual town. In this way, the studied depiction of stark socio-economic realities effloresces into something more mythic but no less piercing. Meyer's hometown becomes a many-layered, poetic, and often ghostly space, recalling T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land and William Carlos Williams' Patterson. As it moves between past and future, face and landscape, textural detail and vast tableau, Meyer's shifting perspectives demand a reconsideration of what 'local' is: what makes a place a place within the homogenised landscape of postindustrial capital, and what attitude or degree of proximity might disclose it.

From his extensive trajectory, the edition concentrates on the cycle that opens with the beginning of his activity and that culminates with the closure of the Estudios Rays in 1970, a space in which he displayed the best of his photographic production. It was in the summer of 2018 that Javiera Pérez, daughter of the photographer, summoned us to her house to entrust us with the task of rescuing her father's archive, initiating with the session that Javier Pérez took of Violeta Parra in her dressing room in La Reina, shortly before her suicide. This series was intimately connected with the rest of the images that until now slept in the various boxes with negatives that Javiera jealously kept in her house. The boxes with negatives had been patiently classified and ordered years ago by Javiera's mother, Diana Escalate, a noted ballet dancer of the Municipal Ballet of Santiago, a photographer of great talent and the second wife of Javier Perez.

Contemporary art has crowned this perspective by talking about ""work in progress"". Artists knew this since way back, through their own experience. In particular, photographers who work on the photogenicity, in its temporal process of shaping. That is the general problem that this book explores and that has been thought of in the 6th. International Week RETINA.Argentina, in December 2019. This time, from a specific perspective, that of the investigative process, like that of a detective, in the manner of the writer Patrick Modiano, ""in search of an evocative detail allowing to reconstitute a set, although there was no such set, but nothing more than fragments, stardust"" (Patrick Modiano, L'horizon, 2010).Then, the works, the production of contemporary artists and photographers in particular, current and universal art - let us also consider Prehistory, Leonardo Da Vinci and Duchamp - appear under a new face, multiple, enriched, thanks to research, to a work that progresses to infinity and never ends: the recipient can continue indefinitely the research and the work.

Working primarily in photography and sculpture, Leonard consistently confronts the realities of change, love, and loss. This book brings audiences up to date on Leonard's impressive body of work and accompanies a long-awaited retrospective exhibition. It features images and examinations from every one of Leonard's major series, including her early aerial and museum photographs, her landmark works- 'Strange Fruit' and 'Analogue'-and her most recent works, ""In the Wake."" Essays in the book range from the critical to the personal, including explorations of sexual politics, immigration, and family.

It is organized in inverse chronological order and spans the photographer's whole career to date: from Joel Meyerowitz's most recent picture all the way back to the first photograph he ever took. The book covers all of Joel Meyerowitz's great projects: his work inspired by the artist Morandi, his work on trees, his exclusive coverage of Ground Zero, his trips in the footsteps of Robert Frank across the US, his experiments comparing color and black and white pictures, and of course his iconic street photography work. Joel Meyerovitz is incredibly eloquent and candid about how photography works or doesn't, and this should be an inspiration to anyone interested in photography.

Nach seinem Studium an der Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst in Leipzig führten ihn verschiedene Aufträge und zahlreiche freie Projekte nach St. Petersburg, Madrid, Prag, Berlin, London und Istanbul. Martens ganz eigene Bildsprache konterkariert dabei visuelle Vorurteile und versucht scheinbar feststehende Identitäten mit Witz und Sarkasmus zu unterlaufen. So entpuppt sich manch eherne Heimat als locker sitzende Tapete und manch schönes Gesicht als sich im Wandel und Aufbau befindliche Fassade. In kurzen Episoden erzählt er von seinen ziemlich riskanten Fotoabenteuern in der unberechen-baren Welt des schönen Scheins.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jahrhunderts in der Schweiz nichts Vergleichbares gibt. Einzigartig ist die Dokumentation des Kohle-Tagebaus in Gondiswil und Umgebung, ästhetisch eindrückliche Bildzeugnisse des in der Schweiz seltenen Braunkohleabbaus. Das Kunsthaus Langenthal zeigt erstmals einen umfassenden Überblick über Schärs Schaffen, basierend auf einem spektakulären Fund von gegen 5000 Glasnegativen, Abzügen, Alben und Ansichtskarten, die das Fotobüro Bern gesichert und aufgearbeitet hat. Der Landwirt und Bannwart Johann Schär (1855-1938), genannt 'Dängi Hannes' begann um 1900 zu fotografieren. Als Dorf- und Wanderfotograf entwickelte er insbesondere in der Personenfotografie einen eigenständigen fotografischen Blick, der nicht ohne Humor und mit Präzision Menschen- und Alltagsbeobachtungen dieser Epoche einfing.

Ob Schlachtfelder, Tatorte oder andere Schauplätze historisch bedeutsamer Ereignisse, stets haben die an ihnen stattgefundenen Geschehnisse in Folge die Wahrnehmung der Orte nachhaltig verändert. Gleichfalls wandelt sich mit dem Wissen um diese Geschehnisse auch der Blick auf die Bilder. Das künstlerische Interesse am historischen Ort lässt sich seit Beginn der 1990er Jahre und vermehrt seit der Jahrtausendwende international beobachten. Dabei geht es den Fotografinnen und Fotografen um mehr als rein formal-ästhetische Fragen. Vielmehr lenken sie den Blick auf die heutige sozio-kulturelle Signifikanz der Orte - beispielsweise als lieux de mémoire im Sinne Pierre Noras -, aber auch auf die medialen Bedingungen der Vergegenwärtigung und Vermittlung von Geschichte. Mit dem Motiv des historischen Ortes als Stellvertreter eines längst vergangenen und damit nicht mehr unmittelbar fotografisch abbildbaren Ereignisses rücken zudem das Paradox einer Fotografie von Vergangenheit und damit die medialen Bedingungen und Grenzen des Mediums in den Fokus.

La irrupción del conceptualismo propiciará la reflexión teórica acerca del arte y, con ello, los ensayos teóricos de fotógrafos o allegados al medio adquieren de nuevo toda su relevancia.  Estética fotográfica reúne una veintena de ensayos significativos que explican los fundamentos teóricos de las diferentes tendencias de la fotografía. Entre sus autores se cuentan precursores del medio como Fox Talbot o Henry Peach Robinson, artistas como Moholy-Nagy y fotógrafos contemporáneos influyentes como Edward Weston o Minor White. Aunque esta antología estética aspira a ser una herramienta útil para estudiantes y fotógrafos, también constituye una buena introducción a la polémica teórica de un medio que ha influido de manera clave en las artes visuales y en la cultura contemporánea.

Le travail de Luuk Wilmering est basé sur les questions concernant sa propre identité, qu'il évoque en faisant des feintes. En dépit de leurs thèmes communs et l'apparence ordinaire, les images attirent immédiatement l'attention. La démarche de Wilmering est basé sur la frontière où l'art et la vie se touchent. Son oeuvre comprend des installation, des collages, des promenades audio, des oeuvres pour des projections et des livres de l'artiste. Avec ses travaux il peint un portrait saisissant d'impuissance : l'incapacité de se comporter selon les conventions d'interaction sociale. Pour le spectateur, de telles images provoquent de temps en temps un sentiment maladroit d'embarras doux ou la confusion. Et de temps en temps, les images leur ont un élément de tragédie.

Becoming disfarmer,Mike Disfarmer,photography,First published in 2014,/works/OL19995463W,/authors/OL1911013A/Mike_Disfarmer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 178,"This book uses a sequence of over 100 images to tell the story of Mike Disfarmer's vernacular portraiture and its transformation into art. This monograph features his vintage prints along with a selection of enlargements made from his negatives in the 1970s, through which his work first became known. Disfarmer's postcard-size vintage photographs are reproduced in full color to accurately convey their varied surfaces, and most of the examples are shown in the condition in which they were found, rather than as restored images. This publication also reproduces the backs of selected vintage photographs and provides transcriptions of all handwritten notes that appear on the objects. In addition, the monograph contains reproductions of newspaper pages in which Disfarmer's images appeared, locally produced historical journals that include images by other photographers who worked at the same time and in the same region as Disfarmer and album pages like those for which Disfarmer's photographs were originally made.

One of the greatest artists to use photography in the 21st century, Ruff came of age in the 1980s alongside Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer and Thomas Struth, in what was to become known as the Dusseldorf School. Creating photographic images on the scale of history painting but with a cool hyperrealism, Ruff moves from the micro to the macro, from portraying friends to picturing the cosmos. He also oscillates between the laboratory and the archive, experimenting with digital technologies to create photograms with virtual objects and rescuing discarded press photographs to reveal lost histories. Unlike many other publications on his work which assess Ruff's work series by series, this catalogue provides a thematic exploration of his output including portraits, disasters, sky and cityscapes, internet nudes, photograms, manga images, magnetically generated images and found photographs.

Bauhaus student Fritz Winter, who was to become one of Germany's premier postwar abstract painters, was likewise obsessed in the 1930s with the metaphorical qualities and the aesthetic of light. He proved to be a virtuoso at incorporating the transparency of glass and crystal, as well as the reflections and luminosity of light, into his artworks. Exhibition and publication take a new approach to illuminating this innovative aspect of Winter's early career. The light and crystal paintings he executed from 1934 to 1936 are juxtaposed with experimental photographs from the 1920s and 30s in order to highlight parallels between the period's abstract painting and photography. Exhibition: Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany (9.11.2012-10.2.2013).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
