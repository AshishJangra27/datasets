Anthology of Catalan lyric poetry,Joan Triadú,poetry,First published in 1953,/works/OL952163W,/authors/OL85140A/Joan_Triadú,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6136413M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1953|Publisher  University of California Press|Language Catalan|Pages 395,"The field of Catalan lyric poetry is wide and varied, and its history has been a long one. This particular anthology was compiled in order to bring together its essentials rather than to provide a representative selection; my criterion was personal throughout, my choice being based upon my own reactions to the poems I read. I excluded such whole periods and genres as could make no contribution to the essential message which any poetry contains for all mankind, in so far as it is the synthesis of any people's personality. This anthology became more homogeneous as a result of my approach. It gained, indeed, a certain timelessness, for a living community of experience became apparent in poems from every age. - Introduction.

Rebel Souls is the first book ever written about the colorful group of artists-- regulars at Pfaff's Saloon in Manhattan--rightly considered America's original Bohemians. Besides a young Whitman, the circle included actor Edwin Booth; trailblazing stand-up comic Artemus Ward; psychedelic drug pioneer and author Fitz Hugh Ludlow; and brazen performer Adah Menken, famous for her Naked Lady routine. Central to their times, the artists managed to forge connections with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark Twain, and even Abraham Lincoln. This vibrant tale, packed with original research, offers the pleasures of a great group biography like The Banquet Years or The Metaphysical Club. Justin Martin shows how this first bohemian culture--imported from Paris to a dingy Broadway saloon--seeded and nurtured an American tradition of rebel art that thrives to this day. ""--  ""Certain moments and settings in literary history are so dense and rich as to require a group biography. Bloomsbury, Berlin in the 20's, or the periods in Paris that inspired The Banquet Years or A Charmed Circle are among these.The birth of Bohemia in New York on the eve of the Civil War is such a moment. The brilliant, rowdy circle included Walt Whitman, Edwin Booth, the comic Artemus Ward, and reached out to involve Emerson, Albert Bierstadt, and Mark Twain. Whitman towered over this circle which in turn liberated both his life and his work. In this ebullient story, packed with original research, Justin Martin, the author of 3 acclaimed and successful biographies, shows how this first ""Bohemian"" culture, imported from Paris, sprouted in a dingy Broadway saloon against the shadow of a fractured nation, nurtured and launched Walt Whitman and seeded an American tradition of rebel art that endures today.

Poems at the edge of differences,Renate Papke,poetry,First published in 2008,/works/OL16964460W?edition=ia%3Apoemsatedgediffe00papk,/authors/OL7208803A/Renate_Papke,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25556738M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language English|Pages 214,"This study consists of two parts. The first part offers an overview of feminism’s theory of differences. The second part deals with the textual analysis of poems about ‘mothering’ by women from India, the Caribbean and Africa. Literary criticism has dealt with the representation of ‘mothering’ in prose texts. The exploration of lyrical texts has not yet come. Since the late 1970s, the acknowledgement of and the commitment to difference has been foundational for feminist theory and activism. This investigation promotes a differentiated, ‘locational’ feminism (Friedman). The comprehensive theoretical discussion of feminism’s different concepts of ‘gender’, ‘race’, ‘ethnicity’ and ‘mothering’ builds the foundation for the main part: the presentation and analysis of the poems. The issue of ‘mothering’ foregrounds the communicative aspect of women’s experience and wants to bridge the gap between theory and practice. This study, however, does not intend to specify ‘mothering’ as a universal and unique feminine characteristic. It underlines a metaphorical use and discusses the concepts of ‘nurturing’, ‘maternal practice’ and ‘social parenthood’. Regarding the extensive material, this study understands itself as an explorative not concluding investigation placed at the intersections of gender studies, postcolonial and classical literary studies. Most of all, it aims at initiating a dialogue and interchange between scholars and students in the Western and the ‘Third World’.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Beliefs and blasphemies: a collection of poems,Virginia Hamilton Adair,poetry,First published in 1998,/works/OL14957560W,/authors/OL32554A/Virginia_Hamilton_Adair,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL699624M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1998|Publisher  Random House|Language English|Pages 109,"Beliefs and Blasphemies exhibits the same qualities--accessibility, deep feeling, wisdom, humor, and technical brilliance--that made Virginia Hamilton Adair's first collection of poems, Ants on the Melon, into a bestseller and a literary landmark. Here Mrs. Adair devotes her attention to a single theme, religion, but in her brilliant performance the theme's variations turn out to be wide and deep--from reverence to iconoclasm, from comedy to profundity, from joy to lament. If you are looking for Hallmark platitudes or E-Z faith, look elsewhere.In ""Saving the Songs,"" for example, we reconsider Martin Luther's penchant for recycling barroom tunes into hymns: ""Said Luther of the singing in saloons,/'Why should the devil have the choicest tunes?'"" More soberly, in ""The Reassem-blage,"" we are asked to test the extremes of the Christian version of the hereafter--""one a verdict brutal beyond imagination,/the other by most reports an eternity of boredom""--against our hearts' hopes. The conclusion? ""Some myths are too terrible for our believing."" ""Goddesses First"" muses about the primacy of female deities in many religious myths. ""Choosing"" uses the poet's virtual blindness to explain her celebration of the only distinction her ""frail vision can discern"": the literal difference between night and day. Zen temples and the chapel at a state mental hospital, animism and meditation, whores and angels--this curious, witty, and compassionate sensibility encompasses them all.Virginia Hamilton Adair is a uniquely American poet--restless in her lyrical investigations, hopeful and honest, rigorous in her formal accomplishments, spontaneous in her emotions. Beliefs and Blasphemies will appeal to anyone who has ever thought about first things or final things--anyone who enjoys speculating about how we got here and where we're going--and it will reconfirm its author's stature as a national treasure.From the Hardcover edition.

Earthling,James Longenbach,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL19729553W,/authors/OL220760A/James_Longenbach,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 94,"""'Earthling' is one of the oldest words in the English language, our original word for ploughman, a keeper of the earth. In poems simultaneously ordinary and otherworldly, James Longenbach traces the life of a modern-day earthling as he looks squarely at his little patch of earth and at the vast emptiness of interstellar space. Beginning with the death of the earthling's mother and ending with a confrontation with his own mortality, the poems within Earthling resist complaint or agitation. In them, the real and the imagined, the material and the allegorical, intersect at shifting angles and provide fresh perspectives and lasting consolation.""--Page [4] of cover.

Carl Dennis has won acclaim for ""wise, original, and often deeply moving"" poems that ""ease the reader out of accustomed modes of seeing and perceiving"" (The New York Times). Many of the poems in this new book involve an attempt to enter into dialogue with pagan and biblical perspectives, to throw light on ordinary experience through metaphor borrowed from religious myth and to translate religious myth into secular terms. While making no claims to put us in touch with some ultimate reality, these clear, precise, sensitive poems help us to pay homage to the everyday household gods that are easy to ignore, the gods that sustain life and make it rewarding.

Duhamel's poems readily admit that she is a love-struck fool, but also embrace the 'crazy wisdom' of the Fool of the Tarot deck and the fool as entertainer or jester. From a kindergarten crush to a failed marriage and beyond, Duhamel explores the nature of romantic love and her own limitations. She also examines love through music, film, and history--Michelle and Barak Obama's inauguration and Cleopatra's ancient sex toy. Duhamel chronicles the perilous cruelties of love gone awry, but also reminds us of the compassion and transcendence in the aftermath. In 'Having a Diet Coke with You,' she asserts that 'love poems are the most difficult poems to write / because each poem contains its opposite its loss / and that no matter how fierce the love of a couple / one of them will leave the other / if not through betrayal / then through death.' Yet, in Blowout, Duhamel fiercely and foolishly embraces the poetry of love.""--from publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Morning, Paramin",Derek Walcott,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20046336W,/authors/OL32247A/Derek_Walcott,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 108,"Morning , Paramin offers us a stunning collaboration between a Nobel Prize-winning poet, Derek Walcott, and a renowned figurative painter, Peter Doig. It journeys through the physical and psychological landscapes of two lives, from the snowy landscapes of Edmonton to the sun-washed shores of the Caribbean, from the process of mourning a loved one to the experience of watching a film. Taking the form of a call-and-response, with paintings on one side and poetry on the other, Morning Paramin lets Walcott's characteristic perception and wit shine through in his illuminating responses to Doig's luminescent paintings. Both poems and paintings are triumphant celebrations of life's pleasures and pains--loving, observing, aging. Walcott, born and living in St. Lucia, and Doig, living in Trinidad, engage in a powerful dialogue on the Caribbean's colonial legacy, the politics of home and belonging, and the boundaries of art. A poignant exploration of a friendship and a vibrant meditation on the difficult beauty of the Caribbean, Morning , Paramin probes the boundaries of communication and celebrates the thrills of a shared language.

Sonata Mulattica,Rita Dove,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL1980877W?edition=ia%3Asonatamulatticap0000dove,/authors/OL238257A/Rita_Dove,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24361775M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  W. W. Norton|Pages 231,"Detailing the volatile relationship between the black violinist George Bridgetower and Beethoven, this is a ""masterful collection"" (Los Angeles Times).  The son of a white woman and an “African Prince,” George Polgreen Bridgetower (1780–1860) travels to Vienna to meet “bad-boy” genius Ludwig van Beethoven. The great composer’s subsequent sonata is originally dedicated to the young mulatto, but George, exuberant with acclaim, offends Beethoven over a woman. From this crucial encounter evolves a grandiose yet melancholy poetic tale. (W. W. Norton)   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Injury time,Clive James,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL19733616W,/authors/OL401515A/Clive_James,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 96,"The publication of Clive James's Sentenced to Life was a major literary event. Facing the end, James looked back over his life with a clear-eyed and unflinching honesty to produce his finest work: poems of extraordinary power that spoke to our most elemental emotions. Injury Time finds James with more time on the clock than he had anticipated, and all the more determined to use it wisely - to capture the treasurable moment, and think about how best to live his remaining days while the sense of his own impending absence grows all the more powerfully acute. In a series of intimate poems - from childhood memories of his mother, to a vision of his granddaughter in graceful acrobatic flight - James declares 'family' to be our greatest blessing. He also writes beautifully of the Australia where he began his life, and where he hopes to 'reach the end'. Throughout Injury Time, James weaves poems which reflect on the consolation and wisdom to be found in the art, music and books which have become ever more precious to him in his last years. The poems in this moving, inspirational and unsentimental book are as accomplished as any he has ever written; indeed the unexpected gift of James's Injury Time shows him to be in the form of his life.

Tom has returned to his family's farm in Kenya for the summer vacation between school and university when he is swept up by the events of the Mau Mau uprising. Beginning with sporadic, brutal attacks by dispossessed Kikuyu on the British now occupying their land – attacks often executed with nothing more than traditional panga knives – the conflict escalates as the terrified British stop at nothing to re-impose order, eventually driving most of the Kikuyu population into the prison camps of what has become known as 'Britain's Gulag'. As Tom is propelled into violence and horror the poem mutates into a meditation on the inheritance of conflict, the destruction of innocence and the impossibility of afterwards saying what one has seen.Written with rigour, intelligence, and a fierce, unsparing clarity, this is profound, lyrical work with that rare confidence and thrilling originality that announce the arrival of a significant new voice.

Inri,Raúl Zurita,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL25056543W,/authors/OL8716501A/Raúl_Zurita,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Marick Press|Language English|Pages 134,"""""INRI"" responds to the need to find a language for an event that was kept hidden and excluded from official records in Chile: the fact that the bodies of the disappeared were thrown out of helicopters into the mouths of volcanoes and into the sea. In order to bring this event, which was neither seen nor heard, into language, Zurita invents a form and language capable of bringing it into the present. The one place where these unspeakable acts might be registered is in the landscape of Chile: the mountains, desert, and sea. There the event might begin to be touched, heard, and finally seen. When there are no places from which to speak, 'the stones cry out'. ""INRI"" is written as poetry without regular lines or metre. In the tradition of Whitman or Ginsberg's Howl, it works with long breaths and large blocks of meaning: intensities that overrun the usual measures of speech and syntax. To read it is to experience a strange force pulsing through the language, breaking apart its usual channels, and opening unseen and unheard zones."" ""Zurita, winner of the Chilean National Poetry Prize, is one of the best known poets of Latin America. His work is part of a revolution in poetic language that began in the 1970s and sought to find new forms of expression, radically different from those of Pablo Neruda. The challenge was to confront the contemporary epoch, with its particular forms of violence, including violence done to language. ""INRI"" is distinctive in that it does not speak out of individual sorrow, though this is not missing from the text, but seeks, rather, a new space, out of which love might be asserted as prime human reality, a space which might give birth to a different type of society.""--BOOK JACKET.

Noted scholar Ilan Stavans tackles the avant-garde poet's politics head-on in an enlightening new introduction that places Vallejo in his proper literary context, while Margaret Sayers Peden's new translation does full justice to Vallejo's complex literary style. Including Spanish and English versions of more than eighty poems that span the arc of his career, this volume is certain to become the leading collection of Vallejo's work for years to come.

Toklas, reveals a vulnerability and tenderness unexpected of one so famous for caustic wit. Associative in structure, the work consists of alternately cryptic and conversational fragments detailing a shared domestic life. A very brief initial section observes the hardships of gay estrangement from society, while the body of the work applauds the decision to endure these for love's sake. Readers will welcome an unusual view of Stein in this first trade edition of a signal work in which ""lifting belly""--signifying sexual union--comes to imply passionate commitment to another and acceptance of oneself.

But not only have English classes neglected this masterpiece of rhyme and meter, History classes have neglected the story of the pivotal battle upon which the poem is based.  This book brings together the poem, the historical background of the famous battle, a riveting account of the battle itself, and a discussion of its historical consequences. The poem is fully annotated, and is supplemented with two interesting essays by Chesterton himself. Well-known Chesterton expert, Dale Ahlquist, has gathered together all the insightful commentaries and explanatory notes. Here is the story behind the modern conflict between Christianity and Islam, between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and the origin of the Feast of the Holy Rosary. A fascinating blend of literature, history, religion and romance!   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Frank Bidart writes that Sewell offers a ‘terrible purity’ fashioned out of the ‘desolation’ her poems work through, poems with ‘great weight and power.’ I concur. We encounter an intelligent, elegant, darkly honest poet who feeds our eyes, ears, mind, and heart.”    —Colorado Review  “Sewell searches for what lies beneath her own humanity: her capacity for violence and love; what one’s ‘nature’ determines about oneself; and how the mind and spirit can exist willingly with the ‘knowledge that we are hopelessly enclosed / by the measure of our skins.’ . . . Sewell’s debut collection The Way Out, is a very fine read.” —Quarterly West  “There’s a terrible purity to the desolation from which many of these poems emerge. They emerge with unlacquered finality. Their gaze is pitiless. Cumulatively, Sewell’s poems possess great weight and power. In this ferocious book you will find the consolation of something seen deeply, the consolations of art.” —Frank Bidart  “Lisa Sewell’s poetry brings to mind Keats’ phrase, ‘thinking through the heart.’ More than any young poet writing today, her work frames an urgency shot through with history as she builds a model of consciousness, original, strange. These poems enact a lyric muscle that explodes narrative, throws it wonderfully off track into new regions of feeling, thought, experience.”    —Deborah Digges  “‘We are hopelessly enclosed by the measure of our skins,’ Lisa Sewell writes. The argument at the heart of this book is whether the body is a source of hopelessness or of hope. ‘I put my faith in the physical,’ Sewell tells us, but she understands how belief necessitates doubt, only exsisting beside it. Focused and accomplished, this fine debut collection is a fierce and engaging quarrel with the fact of flesh.”    —Mark Doty   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Forget Language poetry. Forget desires for a totalizing poetics. Fuhrman is a leader in the particular, in ‘infra-surrealism.’ She taboos nothing; no form impedes her complete wit. This full poetry is not only ‘feminine, marvelous, and tough,’ but subtle, searching, and wounded—sexual, social, and smart. Fuhrman celebrates new truth-telling, an art of the spectacular pageant.”    —David Shapiro  “Joanna Fuhrman is a witty visionary for our virtual age. Her poems invite you not just to read but to become immersed in their delightfully protean postmodern landscapes. The work is both exotic and mundane, retro and futuristic at the same time. Pulsating with surround-sound and a panoply of ‘neon fluid’ special effects, this book startles as it entertains.”    —Elaine Equi   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jane Springer is on a thin reed in the present moment reciting incantatory poems. May I plainly say, ‘What a goddamn beautiful book this is.'”    —Jane Miller  “I have a feeling Jane Springer met the devil at the crossroads.  There’s not a note she can’t pluck, and the music is like no one else’s: rich as the red clay of Georgia, startling as a raccoon’s bite, ‘crazy as a shithouse rat’ and cool as sweet tea on a sultry afternoon. There’s some nittygritty here, hauled up from the freezer chest on the porch, unearthed like a mastodon that’s been buried far longer than we can imagine. And there is tremendous vitality and sublimity in this ‘dark county of the heart’ where her music comes from. Whatever devilish bargain has been struck, it has been a boon to all parties. Hallelujah for us all.”    —D.A. Powell  “Jane Springer’s poems are dazzling, devastating and utterly original—sound-rich, sensual, sensational—you will be carried away.”    —Naomi Shihab Nye  “. . .a fine spin of thought. . . . a strong pick for American literary poetry collections.”    —Midwest Book Review  “. . .masterful in its depiction of the sensuality and brutality of the American South. . . . These are poems that face the darkness that abounds in everyday life, they express a love of the colloquial, and they give us glimpses of humor and irony.”    —Tuesday Poem  “[Murder Ballad] is a tangled ode to the South, filled with coon stew, frog guts, pig shit, the violence of rape, slavery, and regret. Springer wrote it with the deep, sisterly love of a drunken, wayward brother she knows better than anyone.”    —Ploughshares  “Traversing the despair of the rural south, Springer exploits the urgency and dread of every keening murder ballad, showing how that cleaving is both our undoing and our salvation.”    —Rain Taxi  “Springer shows time and again that this music is an inheritance, the murder ballad that dwells in ‘the dark county of the heart,’ and her poems hold the tension of wanting ‘to erase the ancient, violent beauty / in the devil of not loving what we love.'”    —Phantom Limb   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Born in 1921, Marie Ponsot began her career in 1956 with True Minds, one of the famous Pocket Poets pamphlets published by City Lights. After this auspicious beginning, Ponsot went on to an unconventional career, and would not publish again until 1981, when Admit Impediment was published by Knopf. Her reemergence--after raising seven children, and always writing, if not actively publishing--brought us a writer of mature wit, unusual rhythms and a poetry of sparkling surface, though her ear is tuned always to the deeper music of human feeling. Ponsot values the local and personal as a proving ground for the grand mysteries, and in examining the powerful underground life of women, her poetry is as practical as it is profound""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What is the difference, he asks, between good and evil, cruelty and instruction, risk and trust? Against the backdrop of the natural world, Phillips pitches the restlessness of what it means to be human, as he at once deepens and extends a meditation on that space where the forces of will and imagination collide with sexual and moral conduct.

New essays on John Clare,Simon Kövesi,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL22314956W,/authors/OL7973093A/Simon_Kövesi,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""John Clare (1793-1864) has long been recognised as one of England's foremost poets of nature, landscape and rural life. Scholars and general readers alike regard his tremendous creative output as a testament to a probing and powerful intellect. Clare was that rare amalgam -- a poet who wrote from a working-class, impoverished background, who was steeped in folk and ballad culture, and who yet, against all social expectations and prejudices, read and wrote himself into a grand literary tradition. All the while he maintained a determined sense of his own commitments to the poor, to natural history, and to the local. Through the diverse approaches of ten proven literary scholars, this collection brings out the ways in which Clare's many angles of critical vision illuminate current understandings of environmental ethics, aesthetics, Romantic and Victorian literary history, and the nature of work""--  ""In his biography of Charles Dickens, John Forster quotes from a now lost letter which contains Dickens' only known reference to John Clare. It is not the kind of response we might have expected from a novelist so well- regarded for sympathetic, nuanced portrayals of the effects and dimensions of poverty. Forster defends his subject: A dislike of display was rooted in [Dickens] ... His aversion to every form of what is called patronage of literature was part of the same feeling ... These views about patronage did not make him more indulgent to the clamour which with which it is so often invoked for the ridiculously small. 'You read that life of Clare?' he wrote (15th of August 1865). 'Did you ever see such preposterous exaggeration of small claims? And isn't it expressive, the perpetual prating of him in the book as the Poet? So another Incompetent used to write to the Literary Fund when I was on the committee: ""This leaves the poet at his divine mission in a corner of a single room. The Poet's father is wiping his spectacles. The Poet's mother is weaving."" - Yah!' He was equally intolerant of every magnificent proposal that should render the literary man independen""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sent by Earth: A Message from the Grandmother Spirit After the Bombing of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,Alice Walker,poetry,First published in 2001,/works/OL14949458W?edition=ia%3Asentbyearthmessa00walk,/authors/OL217774A/Alice_Walker,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8789574M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 27, 2001|Publisher  Open Media|Language English|Pages 64","Alice Walker writes:""Where do we start? How do we reclaim a proper relationship to the world?It is said that in the Babemba tribe of South Africa, when a person acts irresponsibly or unjustly, he is placed in the center of the village, alone and unfettered. All work ceases, and every man, woman and child in the village gathers in a large circle around the accused individual. Then each person in the tribe speaks to the accused, one at a time, about all the good things the person in the center of the circle has done in his lifetime. Every incident, every experience that can be recalled with any detail and accuracy is recounted. All his positive attributes, good deeds, strengths and kindnesses are recited carefully and at length.The tribal ceremony often lasts several days. At the end, the tribal circle is broken, a joyous celebration takes place, and the person is symbolically and literally welcomed back into the tribe. This will not be the fate of Osama bin Laden, accused of masterminding the attack on North America. In a war on Afghanistan, he will either be left alive, while thousands of impoverished, frightened people, most of them women and children and the elderly, are bombed into oblivion around him, or he will be killed in a bombing attack for which he seems, in his spirit—from what I have gleaned from news sources—quite prepared. In his mind, he is fighting a holy war against the United States. To die in battle against it would be an honor. He has been quoted as saying he would like to make the United States into a shadow of itself as he helped make the Soviet Union, which lost the war in Afghanistan, become a shadow of itself. In fact, he appears to take credit for helping the Soviet Union disintegrate. I personally would like him to understand that the shadow he wishes upon us, of poverty, fear, an almost constant state of terror, is merely the America too many of us already know. It is certainly the shadow my ancestors lived with for several hundred years.But what would happen to his cool armor if he could be reminded of all the good, non-violent things he has done? Further, what would happen to him if he could be brought to understand the preciousness of the lives he has destroyed? This is not as simple a question as it might appear. I firmly believe the only punishment that works is love. Or, as the Buddha said: Hatred will never cease by hatred. By love alone is it healed.""

More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech,Cat Ellington,poetry,First published in 2019,/works/OL20422433W,/authors/OL7423822A/Cat_Ellington,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL40050646M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Quill Pen Ink Publishing|Language English|Pages 180,"From the author of Reviews by Cat Ellington comes a gracefully adorned compilation of eccentric beauty and elegant prose flowing with milky fluidity and honey-sweet intellectuality.  Presenting More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech: The Poetry of Cat Ellington, a mystifying collection of poetic productions that glide over multiple genres and wrap themselves around a variety of topics, including racism in America, spiritual warfare, same-sex relationships, delusional disorder, social networking, societal corruption, revenge, oppression, envy, hardship, victory, and much more.  Preceded by eloquent synopses to set the tone, and succeeded by razor-sharp commentaries that will slice through the main arteries of the reader’s psyche, each poem was skillfully authored by the one and only Cat Ellington in her outstanding style of effortless ingenuity, although many in the collection do not suffer the easily offended gladly.  Included in this fascinating compilation are none other than “A Declaration of Independence,” “Enemy-Centered,” “iWonderment,” “The Windows Have Eyes,” “I Call the Wind Mariah Carey,” “And Now A Word From Chicago’s South Side,” “Inspired by Imitation of Life,” “The Golden Goose,” “Mother Chicago,” “This Womanhood,” “Operation imPlantation,” “The Falsifier,” “The Black Girl,” and a great deal more.  Decorated with Watercolors by Ateli, More Imaginative Than Ordinary Speech: The Poetry of Cat Ellington is a deep, powerful, cutthroat, unsparing, and spirited well of truth that will leave a lasting imprint on the reader long after the final page is turned: for the effort is representative of what has come to be expected of its distinctive authorship where it pertains to the written word.  Poetry by Cat Ellington. Unconventional beauty.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Not since Saint Augustine wrote ""Give me chastity, Lord -- but not yet!"" has anyone brought such smart-assed hilarity to a conversion story.Karr's battle is grounded in common loss (a bitter romance, friends' deaths, a teenage son's leaving home) as well as in elegies for a complicated mother. The poems disarm with the arresting humor familiar to readers of her memoirs, The Liars' Club and Cherry. An illuminating cycle of spiritual poems have roots in Karr's eight-month tutelage in Jesuit prayer practice, and as an afterword, her celebrated essay on faith weaves the tale of how the language of poetry, which relieved her suffering so young, eventually became the language of prayer. Those of us who fret that poetry denies consolation will find clear-eyed joy in this collection.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He is the author of three collections of poetry, and his book The Pajamaist won the William Carlos Williams Award. His poems, essays, and translations have appeared in many publications, including BOMB, Harvard Review, Paris Review, The New Yorker, McSweeney's, and The Believer.

I am amazed by its casualness and clarity, its forcefulness, its engrossing strangeness.” Mystery and strangeness remain at the heart of Raab’s work, but now they are revealed more fully through the world around us—everyday deceptions, inexplicable violence, unexpected tenderness, the comedy of hope and desire. In one poem, Proust appears in Raab’s class to confront a student who disputes the great author’s claim that “the true paradises are the lost paradises.” And in the title poem, set just before the Fall, the snake alone understands how people will come to yearn “for whatever they’d lost, and so to survive/ they’d need to forget.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Brownshirt Princess: A Study of the 'Nazi Conscience',Lionel Gossman,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL15167680W,/authors/OL29995A/Lionel_Gossman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24244671M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Open Book,              Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 202","Princess Marie Adelheid of Lippe-Biesterfeld was a rebellious young writer who became a fervent Nazi. Heinrich Vogeler was a well-regarded artist who was to join the German Communist Party. Ludwig Roselius was a successful businessman who had made a fortune from his invention of decaffeinated coffee. What was it about the revolutionary climate following World War I that induced three such different personalities to collaborate in the production of a slim volume of poetry?entitled Gott in Mir?about the indwelling of the divine within the human? Gossman's study situates the poem in the ideological context that made the collaboration possible: pantheism, Darwinism, disillusionment with traditional liberal values, theosophy and völkisch religions, and Lebensreform. The study outlines the subsequent life of the Princess who, until her death in 1993, continued to support and celebrate the ideals and heroes of National Socialism. Brownshirt Princess provides deep insight into the sources and character of the ""Nazi Conscience"", and is invaluable reading for anybody interested in understanding German society during the inter-war and Nazi periods. The University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Princeton University, has generously contributed towards the publication of this volume.

Poemas-faturas que mostram grande familiaridade com a intersemiose explícita da poesia da Era Pós-Verso (apesar do verso). O autor, Erivelto Busto Garcia, transita do verbal ao visual em suas várias facetas. A palavra, considerada enquanto entidade sonora, semântica e gráfica/visual (onde comparece com força o elemento cor) faz tudo a caminho do esgotamento de suas possibilidades (e ele é um expert em tipografia - ou melhor seria 'tipomorfia'? - posuindo um ouvido também incomum): paronomásias, anagramas verbo-visuais, sugerindo movimento/animação/ processo/seqüencialidade. Explora, o autor-poeta, o que os grafemas trazem em potencial e demonstra naturalidade no manuseio de tais recursos e assume os resultados como POESIA. Doutro lado, o verbal enquanto sonoridade tem um peso considerável, a começar pelo título (belo) do volume. Dos anos 50, época em que a visualidade foi assumida/defendida como elemento estrutural do poema - e é da Poesia Concreta que estou falando - aos inícios do terceiro milênio dC, o visual se tem defrontado com situações adversas, mas se nos apresenta, agora, como uma possibilidade entre outras, Erivelto Busto Garcia se sente confortavelmente instalado: faz e o faz com a serenidade de quem já se insere numa tradição de rigor gráfico e ousadia. Além disso, sua poesia é daquelas que podem transitar pelos vários meios (media ou mídias, como se diz hoje no Brasil) sem perda da informação estética, da qual é portadora. Pede para estar na REDE, por exemplo. E é por tudo isso que posso dizer da  sua poesia: responde a exigências do hoje. Uma poesia atual, inclusive no lúdico que oferece. MÍNIMALÂMINA acrescenta algo ao corpus da poesia brasileira que, hoje, ainda experimenta. Arrisca (melhor dizendo). Salve! Omar khouri .

His poetry takes the reader to gardens inhabited by warblers, groundhogs, toads, and bumblebees, to the beginnings of the cosmos, to the Garden of Eden, to the shores of the Sea of Galilee, to the foot of the Cross, and to lonely chapels where God himself hears confessions, where St. Christopher drowsily guards the tabernacle, and where painted statues ""earless listen to the chants."" Pavel meditates on serpents, spiders, thunderstorms, geological processes, and the obstinate sinfulness of humanity. Reminders of the Creator are everywhere:  ""Sight of God, a white-tailed buck / Apparition in the meadow-- / Tines aloft above the rack / A temple's undulant menorah...""  ""Crocodiles are hammered out with tongs / Strong to grapple, strong to sprawl and squat / Fire sprays around them in the forge / Sparks arise, the iron jaws are hot...""  ""A cormorant, glistening with oil and water / A wise crane, ordained as was Melchizidek...""  Pavel's relationship with the spiritual is intimate and affectionate:  ""Our Lord was in the chapel cleaning / Swung his mop in curving lines / As once he wrote archaic dust / So now he soaps a long design...""  ""Mary fell on greyish ice / Near St. Pimen's church on Seleznovskaya-- / An angel helped her, saying: / 'There, there, go slowly dear,' / and led her to Tikhvinskaya...""  ""Gabriel stands behind my chair / Folding brown-blue wings to fit the room...""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The discontinuities between bodily experience, the rhetoric of self-empowerment, and institutional notions of visibility drive the urgency behind these examinations. Fractured language emerges from confrontations with intergenerational pain, ethnicity, queerness, disassociation, and unbelonging. 'Greater Grave''s poetic account of a queer (non)corporeality questions the coded, expected narrative of linear, expansive ""growth""--keeping in mind Anna Tsing's writing on Life in Capitalist Ruins: 'Progress is embedded, too, in widely accepted assumptions about what it means to be human . . . The story of decline offers no leftovers, no excess, nothing that escapes progress. Progress still controls us even in tales of ruination'""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Based on the myth of the blind prophet Tiresias, Hold Your Own is a riveting tale of youth and experience, sex and love, wealth and poverty, community and alienation. Walking in the forest one morning, a young man disturbs two copulating snakes-and is punished by the goddess Hera, who turns him into a woman. This is only the beginning of his journey. Weaving elements of classical myth, autobiography and social commentary, Tempest uses the story of the gender-switching, clairvoyant Tiresias to create four sequences of poems, addressing childhood, manhood, womanhood, and late life. The result is a rhythmically hypnotic tour de force-and a hugely ambitious leap forward for one of the most broadly talented and compelling young writers today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Familiar artifacts of domesticity become as volatile as land mines, and the streets of Damascus, Calcutta, and other faraway locales obliterate the American landscape. Yet Derr-Smith's poetry transcends time and place, illuminating the ties that bind man to woman, mother to child. The Bride Minaret is a relentless chronicle of experience, where the sacred and profane become interchangeable, where Every tent has a name, and every name is the breath of you.

Both sensual meditations and passionate investigations, they reveal complex truths in language luminous and precise. Rooted in the living world, her poems celebrate and elucidate a hard-won affirmation of our human fate. Born of a rigorous questioning of heart, spirit and mind, they have become indispensible to many American readers in navigating their own lives. Hers is a poetry of clarity and hybrid vigour, drawing deeply on English and American traditions but also those of world poetry. The poetries of modern and classical Greece, of Horace and Catullus, of classical China and Japan and Eastern Europe all resonate in Jane Hirshfield's structures of thought and in her sensibilities. Indelibly of our time yet seated in the lineage of poetic discovery, these poems are meant to endure.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Black Moods,Frank Marshall Davis,poetry,First published in 2002,/works/OL4320149W?edition=ia%3Ablackmoodscollec00davi,/authors/OL840872A/Frank_Marshall_Davis,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3939156M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 11, 2002|Publisher  University of Illinois Press|Language English|Pages 275","Black Moods collects for the first time all of Frank Marshall Davis's extant published poems as well as his known previously unpublished work.  Cogently framed by John Edgar Tidwell's insightful introduction, this volume recovers the rich variety of Davis's poetic expression, much of it informed by his political convictions and by his multifaceted work as a journalist. His early work helped promote Chicago as a site of the New Negro Renaissance in the 1930s; late in his career the Black Arts Movement welcomed him as ""the long lost father of modern Black poetry."" Between these two signposts, Davis engaged in a tireless struggle for social, intellectual, political, and aesthetic freedom, lending his considerable energies and intelligence to the fight against racial segregation, anti-Semitism, labor exploitation, and other injustices.  Tidwell examines both Davis's poetry and his politics, presenting a subtle portrait of a complex writer devoted to exposing discriminatory practices and reaffirming the humanity of the common people. From sharp-edged sketches of Southside Chicago's urban landscape to the complicated bright prismatic world that lay beneath Hawaii's placid surface of beach-front hotels, bikinis, and beach bums, Davis's muscular poems blend social, cultural, and political concerns--always shaped by his promise to ""try to be as direct as good blues."" His jazz poetry and love poems offer a lyrical counterpoint to his realistic and satirical verse focusing on urban life, race pride, and fierce social consciousness.  A varied and valuable collection, Black Moods represents the recovery of a powerful and distinctive voice and a marvelous enrichment of African American poetry.

Part antiphonal rant, part rhythmic whisper, Nathaniel Mackey's new collection of poems, Splay Anthem, takes the reader to uncharted poetic spaces. Divided into three sections―""Braid,"" ""Fray,"" and ""Nub"" (one referent Mackey notes in his stellar Introduction: ""the imperial, flailing republic of Nub the United States has become, the shrunken place the earth has become, planet Nub"")―Splay Anthem weaves together two ongoing serial poems Mackey has been writing for over twenty years, ""Song of the Andoumboulou"" and ""Mu"" (though ""Mu no more itself / than Andoumboulou"").  In the cosmology of the Dogon of West Africa, the Andoumboulou are progenitor spirits, and the song of the Andoumboulou is a song addressed to the spirits, a funeral song, a song of rebirth. ""Mu,"" too, splays with meaning: muni bird, Greek muthos, a Sun Ra tune, a continent once thought to have existed in the Pacific. With the vibrancy of a Mira painting, Mackey's poems trace the lost tribe of ""we"" through waking and dreamtime, through a multitude of geographies, cultures, histories, and musical traditions, as poetry here serves as the intersection of everything, myth's music, spirit lift.

What emerges is both an emotional record and an intellectual mapping of what it means to exist in the margins of a war whose atrocities are filtered home through newscasters and computer screens and the distant voice of the beloved. Yet, these are poems that refuse to be sentimental or didactic. The speaker explores the mundane, the mythic and the prophetic in the same attenuated gaze-- planting pepper starts in the ground, recasting Dante's Beatrice, and listening to the barbed vowels of concertina wire thrum across a long distance line-- in an attempt to speak through the silence that shrouds the very unspeakable. At times quiet, at others cacophonous, these poems marry with lyric ferocity the personal and the political in an examination of language and love in 21st century wartime.

A child playing with flashes of sunlight in the aisle of an airplane; a woman describing tropical fruit to someone in a faraway country; a man building a deck with his dead father's hammer; the musings of a Barbie doll participating in a 12-step program: these poems powerfully and lyrically transform the stuff of every day life. A celebration of the poetic voice that includes 33 acclaimed writers, this vibrant anthology proves beyond any doubt that poetry is far more than just words on paper.Quincy Troupe  -  Czeslaw Milosz  - Campbell McGrath  -  C.D.

Sus poemas nos convocan para que, con los ojos bien abiertos y el corazón predispuesto, ahondemos tantos en universos oscuros cuanto en luminosos destellos, con la misma intensidad y el mismo ardor.

Within    these pages, three female poets, Jean Stallings, Diane Martin, and M.    Emily have chosen to express themselves in literally one voice.    BTWM is analogous to a three part symphony. Part I includes And    then She Spoke by new poet, Jean Stallings. Part II Revelations is    written by Diane Martin, and Part III, Perspectives also introduces    new poet M. Emily. Quite without the kind of planning you would    expect, the work of these poets reflects the gamut of emotions one    typically experiences in relationships. The work of Stallings, Martin    and Emily contains an urban inner city flavor from a woman’s    perspective. At times it is quite reminiscent of the rhythms and    poetry of the late 1970s, yet is nevertheless highly contemporary.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The myth of water,Jeanie Thompson,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20040606W,/authors/OL444284A/Jeanie_Thompson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 72,"""The Myth of Water is a cycle of thirty-four poems by award-winning Alabama poet and writer Jeanie Thompson in the voice of world-renowned Alabamian Helen Keller. In their sweep, the poems trace Keller's metamorphosis from a native of a bucolic Alabama town to her emergence as a beloved, international figure who championed the rights of the deaf-blind worldwide. Thompson's artfully concatenated vignettes form a mosaic that maps the insightful mind behind the elegant and enigmatic persona Keller projected. Thompson takes readers on the journey of Keller's life, from some of the thirty-seven countries she visited, including the British Isles, Europe, and Japan to the wellsprings of her emotional awakening and insight. The poems are paired with fascinating biographical anecdotes from Keller's life and samplings from her writing, which infuse the work with richly-rewarding biographical detail. The poems in The Myth of Water reveal the discerning subtlety, resiliency, and complexity of the person Thompson perceives Helen Keller to have been. Through a combination of natural intuition, manual signs, Braille alphabets, and lip reading, Keller came to grasp the revolving tapestry of the seasons and the infinite colors of human relationships. Not a biography or a fictional retelling, The Myth of Water attempts to unlock what moved Keller to her life of service and self-examination. This is a deeply personal story of coming through--not overcoming--a double disability to a fully realized life in which a woman gives her heart to the world.""--  ""A collection of personal poems in the voice of Helen Keller. The poems included in this collection struggle with the humanity behind the name Helen Keller and serve to dramatically portray the person Thompson perceives Helen Keller to be. The poetry takes on many approaches, and as such these poems are based in documented fact filtered through distillations of reading and impressions. Some are fantasies of how Helen might have felt or thought, or how she responded as a woman in a particular circumstance. Thompson hopes, with these poems, to give a sense of Helen's simple humanity and great heart and that they will bring more people to appreciate Helen Keller, a woman who sought justice above all else""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The study is directed at both beginning and more advanced students of literature, and responds to more specialised scholarly inquiries pursued of late in relation to specific poets. Jonathan Post seeks to assimilate many of the post-New Critical theoretical concerns with readings of the major and minor, male and female, authors of the period. Donne, Jonson, the Spenserians, Herbert, Milton, Marvell, Vaughan, as well as many non-canonical and women poets, all receive sustained, fresh, detailed analysis.  In widening the scope of critical commentary, this extremely lucid and elegantly written book avoids the limitations of much recent criticism.

Substrate gathers three new collections of Powell's poetry, the work of a dozen years. These poems open inward windows on the world outward from indigenous habitat in Northern California. They include the past as an aspect of the present, and spirit as a dimension of the actual. The title poem summons twenty-five witnesses from oral and documentary history to focus through the lens of poetry an adult view, over their shoulders, of California history--a compound portrait or collage sampling the indelible strata that compose the cultural substrate of the region. Diverse in theme, stance, tone, genre, and form, the poems in this collection are characterized by lucidity and penetration, plainspoken intensity, compression, and depth.From the Hardcover edition.

Acclaimed poet and critic James Longenbach shows how a poet may manipulate these most basic elements of diction and syntax to create voice, image, tone, or song, and bring a poem to life. Why does a great lyric poem ask to be reread, even after we know it by heart? In How Poems Get Made, Longenbach answers this question by discussing a wide spectrum of exemplary poems, from Shakespeare through Dickinson, Stevens, and Moore, to a variety of poets making poems today. How Poems Get Made is the perfect guide both in the classroom and beyond. Longenbach's clear, wise lessons are essential to anyone interested in composing or appreciating a poem""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Other historical events in Black Hawk's life are depicted, some of a more personal nature, such as ""Swimming in the Rock,"" which was first published in The New Yorker magazine.  Other poems lyrically detail the natural landscape and seasons, culminating in the historical decimation of the tribe by the Illinois militia at the Battle of Bad Axe in southern Wisconsin.

Modern women poets of Spanish America,Sidonia Carmen Rosenbaum,poetry,First published in 1945,/works/OL6794984W,/authors/OL1857528A/Sidonia_Carmen_Rosenbaum,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22148123M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1945|Publisher  Hispanic Institute in the United States|Language English|Pages 273,"In this work I have proposed to study, mainly, that writer who was the first in point of time, and second to none in her poetic worth: Delmira Agustini. In order to place her within the proper historical perspective, I have felt it pertinent and necessary to give, as introduction, some idea of the work of the women poets who preceded her, and also of her influence on modern feminine literature. In doing the latter, I have seen that rather than to determine the influence itself, it was important to establish her relation to the other great women poets who appeared immediately afterwards with distinct and different personalities. Delmira, undoubtedly, had an influence upon them all, setting the example as well as giving the initial impulse. But they cannot, by any manner of means, be considered merely her followers or imitators. The other three major poetesses mentioned were chosen because they have an indubitable originality that makes them differ from Delmira Agustini and from each other.

As part of a lyric experimental tradition, My Mojave is also balkily anti-lyric, interrupting its most flowing effects on purpose. Drawing on the terms of late modernist enterprise to re-invent and re-use poetic form as an indicator of consciousness, Revell brings to us descriptions of the natural world, songlike fragments, declarations that resemble riddles, and musings on poetry and the soul.” —Brenda Hillman, in her judges’ citation for the Lenore Marshall Prize  “Revell is a writer of singular talent and ambition…he takes the reader to unfamiliar and strange places and, in the process, he creates some of the most beautiful poetry in our language.” —Harvard Review  “A rich and rewarding read, My Mojave shows Revell to be an increasingly important poet for our times.” —The Antioch Review  “Donald Revell’s work has changed restlessly from book to book, but its core remains beatific, a kind of poetic inner light.” —Poetry Flash  “…My Mojave is at once fondly intimate and fondly adamant about its contents. What it assumes we shall assume. To the willing reader, it proffers large and small revelations.” —The Constant Critic  “This is a great accomplishment of Revell’s voice in My Mojave; witnessing, he manages to help small details rise to their potential. Each moment of attention is rich and generative. Reading, we are taught—we feel—that ‘waters overplussed with pilgrim stutter’ do, indeed, ‘make more wilderness’ (‘The Government of Heaven’).” —Electronic Poetry Review  “With My Mojave, Revell demonstrates the great art of when to write and when not to, of what to read and when. He writes a spiritual poetry that feels utterly truthful, giving us a phenomenology of spirit remarkably free of institutions and mostly free of habit. My Mojave will leave both those who have long followed Revell’s work and those new to the fold eager to read what’s next.” —Rain Taxi  “This eighth book’s range now encompasses both open-ended sequences and songlike, stanzaic lyric, Christianity and ancient Greece, political anger and paternal affection…Revell’s deliberate drift and concise description distance his new work somewhat from the more difficult poets with whom he has lately been classed: this book instead recalls, and rivals, Gary Snyder’s Buddhist humility and Charles Wright’s luminous verse diaries.” —Publishers Weekly  “America looks, to Revell, far worse, and Revell’s own private life far better, than either did when Revell began to write; his new poetry of prophetic statement sounds just as strange, just as rich in implication, as anything he—or almost any other poet of his generation—has done.” —The Nation  “[In My Mojave,] The peace of nature is disturbed by a distant conflagration, by the rattling postures of stalled war….In tight, focused lines, Revell creates a delicate, exacting music, chimes and silences that hold you in their rhythm and explore the sad deserts we all live in.” —Library Journal   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jalaladdin Rumi (1207-1273), one of the greatest geniuses of mankind and the most eminent mystical poet of any age and all time, has composed over 70,000 verses of poetry. His work has been translated into many languages and is now one of the most widely read poets in America; the more people learned about Rumi, the more they appreciated his depth and were encouraged to dig deeper. This book is also trying to dig deeper; although Rumi’s name stands for love and ecstatic flight into the infinite, he has also poetized his scientific and philosophic concepts and doctrines, which today, after centuries, are established and understood as well known scientific facts. This book attempts to fill in the non-recognized gaps, mainly in the history of physical sciences, covering some important topics in modern scientific views.

But they use the power of poetry to pursue lives of promise and to reach out to friends, families, and communities.This uplifting book also offers the classic poems that have most inspired the Get Lit Players, along with their own personal response poems, and each chapter offers questions, writing prompts, and how-tos for readers to set their own inner poet free. Ending with a section for parents and educators featuring the curriculum that s already in schools throughout California, this slam-dunk shows how to get teens excited about poetry and how to create poetry groups and slams in their own communities.

In his poems Joudah explores big themes—identity, war, religion, what we hold in common—while never losing sight of the quotidian, the specific. Contest judge Louise Glück describes the poet in her Foreword as “that strange animal, the lyric poet in whom circumstance and profession . . . have compelled obsession with large social contexts and grave national dilemmas.” She finds in his poetry an incantatory quality and concludes, “These are small poems, many of them, but the grandeur of conception is inescapable.

Trachtenberg's attracts readership with quippiness jangling and contracting with all sorts of musical possibility.

The incisive psychology, the vividly descriptive diction, the large repertoire of vocabulary, the weightiness of his settings and plots: all these contribute to the delightful sensation that one is reading, simultaneously, the best poetry and best prose. I cannot think of another living poet capable of delivering such pleasure….Not since James Wright has there been a poet so skilled at representing the minds and imaginations of ordinary American working people.” —The Southern Review  “With elegance and restrained subtlety, Mr. Fairchild interweaves topics that become something like musical themes, including the central theme of machine work. . . .Anyone who can lay claim to the authorship of this much excellent poetry wins my unqualified and grateful admiration.” —Anthony Hecht  “In an American culture which has always ignored or disdained class issues, Fairchild and Philip Levine are the only contemporary poets… who take work and the working class as their subjects…. Almost throwbacks, like Steinbeck novels or Walker Evans photographs, Fairchild’s poems recover an America from which we have always turned our heads.” —PN Review (England)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Among the great American poets of the twentieth century, Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams offer a significant contrast with T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Where the latter advocated a theocentric or reactionary response to the cultural crises of modernity, the former affirmed an essentially humanist and democratic social and aesthetic ethos. In Poetry, Politics, and Culture, Harold Kaplan offers a penetrating comparative study of these representative and distinctively influential poets. All four poets wrote in an atmosphere of cultural crisis following World War I, caught as they were between outmoded belief systems and various forms of artistic and political nihilism. While each believed in poetry as a source of cultural values and beliefs, they nevertheless experienced loss of confidence in their own vocation in a world characterized by scientific, rationalist thinking and the mundane struggle for survival. For each, therefore, the poetic imagination was a means of restoring order, or building a new civilization out of chaos. In trying to define a revitalized culture, the four exemplified the perennial quarrel between Europe and America.""--Provided by publisher.

Highly politicized and intensely personal, Moraga's work dares to imagine the mythic nation Queer Atzlán: a brave vision for gender, sexuality, race, art, nationalism, and the politics of liberation. Moraga crosses literary genres to ruminate on the paradox of being at once inside and outside the myriad struggles and communities—interlocking and often at odds—that spur her art and activism. Speaking from her experience as a queer Chicana activist/artist, Moraga is committed to building a broad politic of solidarity and justice for all dispossessed people.  With fierce honesty and incisive political analysis, Moraga offers more than an inspiring portrait of the struggle of an activist artist—she helps us see the world as it is and dream it up anew.

The beauty of these stories and poems lies in their readability: ideal for sharing aloud around the campfire or for a quick, thrilling dip . . . under the covers with a flashlight. The writing itself sends as many awe-inspired shivers down the spine as do the ghosts and goblins on these pages.  Edgar Allan Poe, the master of the horror story and the chiming lyric poem, opens the volume with his best-loved stories: ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Pit and the Pendulum,"" ""The Premature Burial,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""Berenice,"" and ""Ligeia."" Every bit as chilling now as on the day they were written, these tales retain their power to stir the reader again and again. Poe, who was as well known for his poems as for his stories, is also represented by such verse standards as ""The Raven,"" ""Lenore,"" ""To Helen,"" ""Ulalume,"" and ""Annabel Lee,"" among others.  Numerous other practitioners of the supernatural story are included: Edith Wharton, with her gripping ""Afterward""; Charles Dickens and his famed ghost story ""The Signalman""; W. W. Jacobs, with this compilation's inspiration, ""The Monkey's Paw."" Also here are Saki's engrossing ""Sredni Vashtar""; O. Henry's story of love lost and hopes dashed, ""The Furnished Room""; Wilkie Collins's lively ""A Terribly Strange Bed""; and ""The Boarded Window,"" Ambrose Bierce's tale of the bizarre. A year-round collection for reading aloud--and frightening your friends--The Raven and the Monkey's Paw will gratify all manner of thrill-seekers.    --front flap   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Alive with the emotional honesty and intellectual force for which Sapphire has been admired as both a writer and a performance artist, these forty-seven poems take us into America's past and present, bearing testimony to the black experience in a country fragmented by war, racism, and urban and domestic violence. They tell the story of a search for the complicated spiritual path back to one's roots, a story of family, race, and self-transformation.

By weaving the particulars of her own loss into a tapestry that also contains the elements common to all losses, Bang creates something far larger than a mere lament. Continually in search of an adequate metaphor for the most profound and private grief, the poems in Elegy confront, in stark terms and with a resilient voice, how memory haunts the living and brings the dead back to life. Within these intimate and personal poems is a persistently urgent, and deeply touching, examination of grief itself.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Set in Southeast London, Brand New Ancients finds the mythic in the mundane. It is the story of two half-brothers, Thomas and Clive, unknown to each other -- Thomas the result of an affair between his mother and Clive's father. Tempest, with wide-ranging empathy, takes us inside the passionless marriage of Jane and Kevin -- the man who suspects Thomas is not his son, but loves him just the same -- and the neighboring home of Mary and Brian, where betrayal has not been so placidly accepted. The sons of these two households -- quiet, creative Thomas and angry, destructive Clive -- will cross paths in adolescence, their fates converging with mortal fury.These characters' loves, their infidelities, their disappointments and their small comforts -- these, Tempest argues, are timeless. Our lives and our choices are no less important than those of history and myth. Awarded the Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry, Brand New Ancients insists on our importance as individuals -- and asserts Kate Tempest's importance as a talent impossible to ignore""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

S. Eliot since it was first published, Eliot and His Age remains the best introduction to the poet’s life, ideas, and literary works. It is the essential starting place for anyone who would understand what Eliot was about. Russell Kirk’s view of his older friend is sympathetic but not adulatory. His insights into Eliot’s writings are informed by wide reading in the same authors who most influenced the poet, as well as by similar experiences and convictions.  Kirk elaborates here a significant theory of literary meaning in general, showing how great literary works awaken our intuitive reason, giving us profound visions of truth that transcend logical processes. And he traces Eliot’s political and cultural ideas to their true sources, showing the balance and subtlety of Eliot’s views. Eliot and His Age is a literary biography that will endure when much of the more recent writing on Eliot is gathering dust.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The emperor of water clocks,Yusef Komunyakaa,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL20012884W?edition=ia%3Aemperorofwatercl0000komu,/authors/OL34361A/Yusef_Komunyakaa,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27192961M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 113,"""The wildly enchanting new collection from the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Yusef Komunyakaa ""If I am not Ulysses, I am / his dear, ruthless half-brother."" So announces Yusef Komunyakaa early in his lush new collection, The Emperor of Water Clocks. But Ulysses (or his half brother) is but one of the beguiling guises Komunyakaa dons over the course of this densely lyrical book. Here his speaker observes a doomed court jester; here he is with Napoleon, as the emperor ""tells the doctor to cut out his heart / & send it to the empress, Marie-Louise""; here he is at the circus, observing as ""The strong man presses six hundred pounds, / his muscles flexed for the woman / whose T-shirt says, these guns are loaded""; and here is just a man, placing ""a few red anemones / & a sheaf of wheat"" on Mahmoud Darwish's grave, reflecting on why ""I'd rather die a poet / than a warrior."" Through these mutations and migrations and permutations and peregrinations there are constants: Komunyakaa's jazz-inflected rhythms; his effortlessly surreal images; his celebration of natural beauty and of love. There is also his insistent inquiry into the structures and struggles of power: not only of, say, king against jester but of man against his own desire and of the present against the pernicious influence of the past. Another brilliant collection from the man David Wojahn has called one of our ""most significant and individual voices,"" The Emperor of Water Clocks delights, challenges, and satisfies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Knopf|Pages 112","A stunning collection of poems that John Updike wrote during the last seven years of his life and put together only weeks before he died for this, his final book.The opening sequence, ""Endpoint,"" is made up of a series of connected poems written on the occasions of his recent birthdays and culminates in his confrontation with his final illness. He looks back on the boy that he was, on the family, the small town, the people, and the circumstances that fed his love of writing, and he finds endless delight and solace in ""turning the oddities of life into words.""""Other Poems"" range from the fanciful (what would it be like to be a stolen Rembrandt painting? he muses) to the celebratory, capturing the flux of life. A section of sonnets follows, some inspired by travels to distant lands, others celebrating the idiosyncrasies of nature in his own backyard.For John Updike, the writing of poetry was always a special joy, and this final collection is an eloquent and moving testament to the life of this extraordinary writer.From the Hardcover edition.

The men reunite in a bar and have a chance meeting with a woman that changes their outlook on life.  This screenplay tells of their road to discovery and the struggles they endure on the road to becoming a man.  Their lives touch the soul and leave you wanting more.

Lachmann was one of the leading German classicists (and as a distinguished Germanist made relevant editions, too, of many Middle High German poets: see also Karl Lachmann. Eine Biographie, by Martin Julius Hertz, 1851). The two books were the principal occupation of his live from 1845 and are the founding work of 19th century classical philology and modern textual criticism; while drawing the stemma of the older extant MSS of Lucretius with a rigidly scientific recensio Lachmann succeeded in tracing back the lost archetype of the De rerum natura (written during the Carolingian Renaissance) and developed the method which still today is named from him (Lachmann's method, or Lachmannsche Methode: see Sebastiano Timpanaro, La genesi del metodo del Lachmann, Firenze 1963, and many other revised editions; English ed. The genesis of Lachmann's method, Chicago 2005; French ed. La Genèse de la méthode de Lachmann, Paris 2016).

This book reminds us why our nation's consciousness is pervaded by the idea of North: why we fear it and why we inhabit it, how it can be explored and colonized but never conquered, never truly settled.

Worth, a precarious cliff side inn on California's Highway One, a rare-book library in the heart of Houston, a high-school gym in Georgia, an East Texas pine forest, and the violet crowned hills of Austin. The forays collected in this volume always return to Texas, most notably Austin, where the power of childhood memories shed light on the author's life experiences during the pivotal periods of the sixties and seventies. Examples include poems chronicling the day of the University of Texas tower sniper tragedy and the award winning poem ""Night Hawk,"" recording the time that the poet ran face to chest into LBJ in a popular restaurant, a poem, like the writer's collection, recapturing unique and complicated times with irony, wit, and joyful mourning.

William Blake e William Butler Yeats,Antonielli Arianna,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL20933872W,/authors/OL8013118A/Antonielli_Arianna,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Firenze University Press,"Da Blake a Yeats. Sistemi simbolici e costruzioni poetiche is an investigation into the – from many aspects decisive – influence that the symbolic system and visionary poetry of the great English romantic William Blake had on the imagination of William Butler Yeats from his earliest youth. This authentic poetic and visionary apprenticeship in the work of Blake, which culminated in 1893 in the edition in three volumes accompanied by an exhaustive introduction and commentary: The Works of William Blake Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical, was decisive for the formation of the symbolic system that was to nourish all Yeats' poetry. Adopting an approach to the reading that unfurls from an initial analysis of Blake's poetic corpus, and hence from the mythical-symbolic pantheon that surfaces from this, the book then traces Yeats' initial particular hodos chameliontos, profoundly marked by magical and esoteric experiences, subsequently entering into the meanders of the aesthetic, philosophical and poetic interrelations between the symbolic system of William Blake and that of W. B. Yeats. Da Blake a Yeats illuminates how The Works of William Blake represents the first genuine formalisation of Blakeian and esoteric teachings within Yeats' system, while also representing, for Yeats himself, a keystone in his vision of Blake and an inexhaustible spring for the evolution of his symbolic system and his imagination.  Da Blake a Yeats. Sistemi simbolici e costruzioni poetiche è una indagine sull'influsso, per molti aspetti determinante, che il sistema simbolico e la poesia visionaria del grande romantico inglese, William Blake, ebbero sull'immaginazione di William Butler Yeats fin dalla sua giovinezza. Decisivo ai fini della formazione del sistema simbolico yeatsiano che avrebbe nutrito tutta la sua poesia, fu per lui quel vero e proprio apprendistato poetico e visionario sull'opera di Blake, che si concluse nel 1893 con una edizione in tre volumi, riccamente introdotta e commentata: The Works of William Blake Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical. Adottando un percorso di lettura che si snoda a partire dall'analisi del corpus poetico blakiano e quindi dal pantheon mitico-simbolico che da esso affiora, per poi attraversare il primo particolare hodos chameliontos yeatsiano, profondamente segnato da esperienze magiche ed esoteriche, entrando quindi nei meandri del rapporto estetico, filosofico e poetico tra il sistema simbolico di William Blake e quello di W. B. Yeats, Da Blake a Yeats mette in luce come Works of William Blake costituisca la prima vera formalizzazione degli insegnamenti blakiani ed esoterici nel sistema yeatsiano; quanto costituisca, per Yeats stesso, una chiave di volta nella sua visione di Blake e una fonte inesauribile per lo sviluppo del suo sistema simbolico e della sua immaginazione in atto.

Twentieth-Century Russian Poetry,Alexandra Smith,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL23497845W,/authors/OL317917A/Alexandra_Smith,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32618517M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 512,"""The canon of Russian poetry has been reshaped since the fall of the Soviet Union. A multi-authored study of changing cultural memory and identity, this revisionary work charts Russia’s shifting relationship to its own literature in the face of social upheaval. Literary canon and national identity are inextricably tied together, the composition of a canon being the attempt to single out those literary works that best express a nation’s culture. This process is, of course, fluid and subject to significant shifts, particularly at times of epochal change. This volume explores changes in the canon of twentieth-century Russian poetry from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union to the end of Putin’s second term as Russian President in 2008. In the wake of major institutional changes, such as the abolition of state censorship and the introduction of a market economy, the way was open for wholesale reinterpretation of twentieth-century poets such as Iosif Brodskii, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandel′shtam, their works and their lives. In the last twenty years many critics have discussed the possibility of various coexisting canons rooted in official and non-official literature and suggested replacing the term """"Soviet literature"""" with a new definition – """"Russian literature of the Soviet period"""".    Contributions to this volume explore the multiple factors involved in reshaping the canon, understood as a body of literary texts given exemplary or representative status as """"classics"""". Among factors which may influence the composition of the canon are educational institutions, competing views of scholars and critics, including figures outside Russia, and the self-canonising activity of poets themselves. Canon revision further reflects contemporary concerns with the destabilising effects of emigration and the internet, and the desire to reconnect with pre-revolutionary cultural traditions through a narrative of the past which foregrounds continuity. Despite persistent nostalgic yearnings in some quarters for a single canon, the current situation is defiantly diverse, balancing both the Soviet literary tradition and the parallel contemporaneous literary worlds of the emigration and the underground.    Required reading for students, teachers and lovers of Russian literature, Twentieth-Century Russian Poetry brings our understanding of post-Soviet Russia up to date.""
