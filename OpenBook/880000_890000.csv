Son premier volet expose de manière claire et concise les notions indispensables à la compréhension de la musique (notes, durées, rythmes, gammes, accords, tonalités, modulations, modes, nuances, ornements...) et offre enfin droit de cité à de nombreux thèmes moins souvent abordés comme les musiques du xxe siècle, le jazz, l informatique musicale, la notation ancienne, l histoire de la pensée harmonique ou l évolution des tempéraments...    Sans omettre les traditions musicales non occidentales, le Guide des « théoriciens » présente dans un second volet pour la première fois sous une forme chronologique les très nombreux auteurs ayant contribué au développement du langage et de la pratique musicale au cours des siècles, qu ils soient théoriciens, compositeurs, célèbres, anonymes, voire mythiques.    Enfin, un inventaire du vocabulaire essentiel et un ensemble de tableaux pratiques synthétisent les réponses aux interrogations les plus fréquentes : chronologie, terminologie, modes, chiffrages, sons harmoniques, neumes, conventions des octaves, rythmes de danse...; tandis que de nombreux index, comme l I>index visuel reliant les symboles solfégiques courants aux notions étudiées, permettent un accès rapide aux différentes informations, encourageant la brève consultation autant que l étude approfondie.    Irremplaçable outil de travail combinant pédagogie, encyclopédie et synthèse, ce guide s adresse autant aux mélomanes qu aux élèves de conservatoires, aux étudiants ou aux chercheurs.

Maddie Myles, the charismatic lead singer, leaves her partner and the band at the height of its fame, and disappears. Her ex, Miles Gerber, has been touring the bar circuit for 20 years with his own group ""Miles Gerber and The Shit Disturbers."" As the audience declines, Miles says each night that they are 'searching for the end of the music business.' Miles is unwilling to be interviewed, so the reporter gives an old tape recorder to the group's drummer, who gives us a rolling report on the slow decline of the band, and the music business in general.    One day, in their beat-up touring van, they pick up a dynamic young woman at the side of the road, who starts them on a new journey: not an ending, but a new direction that leads to revival, and lots of self-discovery for Miles. Along the way they learn the value of community, and the power of stories.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After twenty years of un-wedded bliss Georges and Albin, two men partnered for better-or-worse get a bit of both when Georges' son (fathered during a one-night fling) announces his impending marriage to the daughter of a bigoted, right-wing politician. Further complicating the situation is the 'family business': Albin and Georges run a transvestite nightclub in St. Tropez, where Albin is the ""star"" performer 'Zaza.' Georges reluctantly agrees to masquerade as ""normal"" when he meets the family of the bride-to-be. But Albin has other plans, with hilarious results""--Back cover.

Digging deeper than other accounts, this history begins in the early 1960s, tracing the chain of events that spawned some of the greatest rock acts of all time in the 1990s, including Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden. First-ever interviews include Eddie Vedder's take on Pearl Jam’s history, a discussion among the members of Alice in Chains, and Layne Staley’s mother’s comments on her son's drug addiction and death. There is also plenty of information on less well-known aspects of the grunge scene, including the Riot Grrrl movement and the oft-overlooked but highly influential Seattle bands such as Mother Love Bone/Andy Wood, the Melvins, Screaming Trees, and Mudhoney. The end result is a comprehensive guide that includes a wealth of previously untold stories and offers a fresh and immediate approach to music history.

Elson's music dictionary: containing the definition and pronunciation of such terms and signs as are used in modern music : together with a list of foreign composers and artists ... and a short English-Italian vocabulary of musical words and expressions,Louis Charles Elson,music,First published in 1933,/works/OL15138632W?edition=ia%3Aelsonsmusicdicti00elsorich,/authors/OL317481A/Louis_Charles_Elson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24206082M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1933|Publisher  Oliver Ditson Company|Language English|Pages 306,"Ever since Tinctor, about 1475, wrote the first music dictionary -- the ""Terminorum Musicae Diffinitorium"" -- there has been an endless succession of books dealing with musical definitions. This is but natural and proper, since the musical art is constantly changing, and a music dictionary, unless frequently revised, easily drops behind the times. The author has endeavored, in these pages, to bring together and classify such material as the modern music teacher or student needs to have at hand in an accessible shape, and to give, as far as possible, the latest developments in the field. As the average teacher is often timid in the matter of pronouncing foreign words, an English phonetic spelling has been added in almost every instance. Yet it will be best for the student to familiarize himself with the rules for pronouncing each language (which are also given) since it is sometimes impossible to reproduce the exact sound of a foreign word in any English spelling. An attempt has also been made to give the pronunciation of the names of the chief composers, singers, pianists, conductors, etc. These points, and the presentation of some of the chief popular errors in music, the addition of a list of works of reference for the most important topics, and the inclusion of some of the most recent details of research, may be sufficient excuse for the making of yet one more music dictionary. - Preface.

The examination also covers McCartney's critically acclaimed work in the first decade of the 21st century, including Memory Almost Full and Ecce Cor Meum, a composition written in the style of sacred English choral music. Throughout, the book supplies analytical insights and historical background to a repertoire that, surprisingly, has not previously been covered in detail.

Works like El Salon Mexico, Billy the Kid, Lincoln Portrait, and Appalachian Spring feature a tuneful idiom that brought the composer unprecedented popular success and came to define anAmerican sound. Yet the cultural substance of that sound--the social and political perspective that might be heard within these familiar pieces--has until now been largely overlooked.While it has long been acknowledged that Copland subscribed to leftwing ideals, Music for the Common Man is the first sustained attempt to understand some of Copland's best-known music in the context of leftwing social, political, and cultural currents of the Great Depression and Second World War....

Gimme Something Better brings this outrageous and influential punk scene to life, from the notorious final performance of the Sex Pistols, to Jello Biafra's bid for mayor, the rise of Maximum RocknRoll magazine, and the East Bay pop-punk sound that sold millions around the globe. Throngs of punks, including members of the Dead Kennedys, Avengers, Flipper, MDC, Green Day, Rancid, NOFX, and AFI, tell their own stories in this definitive account, from the innovative art-damage of San Francisco's Fab Mab in North Beach, to the still vibrant all-ages DIY ethos of Berkeley's Gilman Street. Compiled by longtime Bay Area journalists Jack Boulware and Silke Tudor, Gimme Something Better chronicles more than two decades of punk music, progressive politics, social consciousness, and divine decadence, told by the people who made it happen.

A brief history of music & Fourteen forms of melancholy,Eduardo Chirinos Arrieta,music,First published in 2020,/works/OL32321117W,/authors/OL58716A/Eduardo_Chirinos_Arrieta,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Diálogos|Language English|Pages 139,"""A Brief History of Music is the first complete English-language translation of the late Peruvian writer Eduardo Chirinos's Breve historia de la música, which was awarded the inaugural Premio Case de América de Poesía Americana prize in 2011. The poems in this singular, often poignant collection reflect Chirinos's fascination with music, one of the recurrent topics of his extensive poetic oeuvre alongside childhood, animals, film, the vagaries of memory, painting, and even the poetic tradition itself. Each of the twenty-three carefully crafted pieces here provides an imaginative scenario accompanying a chosen musical piece, from an anonymous Berbérie song to twentieth-century atonal works, featuring favorite compositions by such classical greats as Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Sibelius, Debussy, Gershwin, and Stravinsky, among others. This ninth volume of Chirinos's verse available in English, all translated by G. J. Racz, also includes the delightfully playful, meditative chapbook Fourteen Forms of Melancholy, whose wistful, though ludic tone covers many of the themes found throughout Chirinos's unique, affecting work. This is the second collaboration between Chirinos and Racz to be published by Diálogos Books.

Jaarlijks zullen 600.000 bezoekers hun weg vinden naar het muziekpaleis, dat is ontworpen door Herman Herzberger en Patrick Fransen, in samenwerking met collega-architecten Jo Coenen, Thijs Asselbergs en Pieter Bannenberg. De bouw startte in 2008 en omvatte de renovatie van de befaamde Symfoniezaal en de foyers. In de nieuwbouw zijn vier nieuwe zalen, elk voor een andere muzieksoort, ondergebracht. Fotograaf Herman van Doorn volgde de bouw van TivoliVredenburg op de voet, vanaf de allereerste sloophandeling tot het voltooien van het exterieur. Deze uitgave is een uniek tijdsdocument van de bouw van het laatste muziekpaleis dat, voorlopig althans, in een Nederlandse stad is gerealiseerd.

Het is een oeroud West-Afrikaans geloof dat met de slaven meekwam naar de Nieuwe Wereld, dat werd verboden, maar zich verschool in de muziek. De jazz van Louis Armstrong, de afrobeat van Fela Kuti, de kaseko van Lieve Hugo, de blues van Robert Johnson; ze waren er niet geweest zonder voodoo, of 'voudou'. In 'Voudou' reist Leendert van der Valk van New Orleans naar Haïti, Suriname, Togo en Benin, op zoek naar de relatie tussen voodoo en moderne muziek. Hij neemt de lezer mee naar voodoorituelen, straatfeesten en popconcerten onder begeleiding van een funky soundtrack. De ritmes waarmee voodoo-gelovigen hun goden oproepen gaven gestalte aan de muziek van Buena Vista Social Club tot Antilliaanse dubstep, van superster Beyoncé tot de klassieke componist Gottschalk. 'Voudou' is dus meer dan een muziekboek. Het vertelt de grote, grijze geschiedenis van de slavernij, van verzet en culturele trots en het laat zien hoe voodoogoden nog elke dag aanwezig zijn voor miljoenen mensen wereldwijd.

Hyatt has spent the last four years collecting these sounds and arranging them into uniquely site-responsive music. Working collaboratively under the name Field Works, musicians from around the world have contributed over 50 new compositions to this massive collection. 00In'Metaphonics. The Field Works Listener?s Guide', Hyatt contributes a complete track-by-track guide to the 7-album Field Works box set, addressing from many angles the interpretation of place through sound. Renowned naturalist Bernie Krause writes the book?s foreword, establishing a taxonomy of the soundscapes explored in the book?s essays: geophony (earth sounds), biophony (animal sounds), anthropophony (human sounds) and cosmophony (sounds from outer space).

Antoniotto's treatise shows surprising emphases on Rameau's fundamental bass, and on stacked thirds. Further, the musical illustrations include several grids that are close relatives of the Tonnetz. In one such example, Antoniotto's grid shows horizontal and vertical arrangements of perfect fifths and perfect fourths, with one diagonal as a whole-tone scale. After an introduction that summarizes musical development from the Greek system on, the treatise is divided into three books: the first discusses the general and natural systems, and the natural (major) and artificial (minor) scales. The second derives progressions from movements of the fundamental bass; the third covers figured bass, inversions, fugues, imitations, canons, cadences, accents, vocal types, expressive markings, recitatives and the genres of instrumental and mixed ensembles, the sacred, theatrical, and chamber music. Corelli's Violin Sonata, opus 5/1 is used for demonstrations.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A aby představa o hudebnosti jednotlivých míst Moravy byla ucelená, jsou připojeny soupisy hudebních aktivit v různých historických obdobích (náboženská bratrstva, kantoři-hudebníci, zámecké kapely, hudební spolky, vojenské kapely, uplatnění moravských hudebníků v zahraničí). Kniha je členěna podle národopisných oblastí, obsahuje mapky, řadu ilustračních fotografií a rejstříky (místní, jmenný, chronologický) a 400 stran textu.

August 2015 jährte sich der Todestag des Weimarer Kirchen- und Stadtkantors Melchior Vulpius (* um 1570, + 1615) zum vierhundertsten Mal. Aus diesem Anlass fand am 19. und 20. Juni 2015 eine Tagung im Schloss Elisabethenburg zu Meiningen statt, die sich dem Leben, Werk und historischen Kontext des Komponisten widmete. Die Referate, die hier gesammelt vorliegen, nahmen dabei u. a. das geistliche und weltliche Schaffen Vulpius' in den Blick. Neben Annäherungen an die historische Lebenswelt von Vulpius standen zudem Rezeptionsaspekte im Vordergrund der Diskussion, die zusammengenommen einen Beitrag dazu leisten wollten, das bis heute nur in Ausschnitten bekannte Wirken dieses zu seiner Zeit ""weitberühmbten Musicus"" um neue Erkenntnisse der Musikwissenschaft und -theorie zu bereichern.

(...) Keith ignores the disciplinary boundaries that hold the order of the visual and the sound. It exchanges and traffics with the different poetics, traces a sound whose meaning is given by the way the visual operates.For Keith nothing changes, he keeps painting with the guitar.

Schirmer, Inc.|Language English","The unusual instrumentation is of note: having a clarinet instead of the violin was by all means usual in piano trios; but in addition Mozart replaced the cello with a viola, his favourite instrument by his own admission. As a result the viola has a much stronger part than the cello usually has. - Hal Leonard. The timbres of clarinet and viola give the music an especially intimate and gentle character, as does the fact the first movement is not the typical Allegro, but a slower Andante (and in 6/8 time). Throughout the three instruments are beautifully matched, and the sense of unity arises from the music's concentration and the way Mozart utilizes each instrument's strength. - San Francisco Symphony.
