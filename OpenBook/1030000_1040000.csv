They include reflections on the tools of her trade (handwriting, typewriters), snatches of autobiography (a brief, ill-considered second marriage followed by her migration from New Zealand to England in 1963), and poems on trees, wildlife and everyday objects. Ellen Wilkinson, who led the Jarrow March in 1936, makes two appearances, joining Coleridge, several ancestors and two dogs. The most recent poems in the book recall Adcock's visits around the North Island in 2015, affirming her renewed although not uncritical affection for the country of her birth""--Back cover.

Weaving a New Eden    is personal, historical, political,    inspired—a thoroughly satisfying work    of art.  This is a moving and original    book wrought from a mature and subtle    vision.        — Maurice Manning More than a work of history in verse, Weaving a New Eden represents poet    Sherry Chandler’s confrontation with    mortality, invisibility, loss and    change.  Few poets can move, dazzle,    and enlighten us in a single book, but    Sherry Chandler can – and does – in    this volume of poems.  From the deft    personal lyrics that open *Weaving a    New Eden*, through acrostic poems and    blank verse histories to the stunning    and graceful sonnet crown that closes    the volume, Sherry Chandler bears her    readers into the past and back out    again with a sure hand.  In poems both    scholarly and witty, Chandler lifts    Rebecca Boone out of the shadows of    history to sturdy, quirky reality and    gives us glimpses of the other    invisible women whose lives make up    the hidden half of history. In *Weaving    a New Eden* Sherry Chandler proves    herself a gifted poet at ease in a    range of forms and subjects.  Her work    deserves a wide readership.        — Leatha Kendrick   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Illustrated throughout, Sanders’ poems contain visuals that range from drawings of Egyptian hieroglyphs to a scan of Robert Creeley’s sage counsel, written on a napkin: “Things / come and go. / Then / let them.”  Sanders also offers his own advice in “To the Revolutionaries Not Yet Born”:  *Work in extra dimensions    Think 100 years ahead    Enjoy your Revolution    Show enough mercy so    that Mercy shows the way*  With exuberant pragmatism and visionary scholarship, Sanders continues to mark the way forward for poets and peacemakers, rock 'n' rollers, and revolutionaries.

She and her three siblings lived an idyllic childhood, in which they explored the swamps, fields, and woodlands of the Hammett lands.   This book is dedicated to the Hammetts, Chesters, and Lepards, who took care of the land down Hammett's Lane from the 1860's to the 1970's, and who honoured and repected this fine place.

'A brown push mower rusted into the past' and a country lane 'filled with lilacs . . . their buds now light and full as baby grapes.' Becky has attained in this 'chapbook' a pastoral harmony of thought and reflection.""

From Harlem to Bensonhurst, from a budget hairdresser to the junkie under the corner scaffold, Sheeler (a lifelong New Yorker) allows the people and places she knows so well to engage with the larger universe. In this collection, God is both a prostitute and a suicide bomber; Star Trek a lifeline to sanity amidst the chaos of family dysfunction; police are variously family, foe and rescuers. Using language as musical as it is precise, Sheeler’s poems animate an unexpected world—one you might not want to step into, but can’t tear your eyes away from once you do.

Recircuits,Richard Kostelanetz,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL15297585W?edition=ia%3Arecircuits0000kost,/authors/OL442848A/Richard_Kostelanetz,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24330626M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  NYQ Books|Pages 192,"Long concerned with poetic invention, the indisputably avant-garde writer Richard Kostelanetz has recently been discovering new language forms not with words but within words. This new collection of his Recircuits is one of several efforts in this direction. From the great linguist Roman Jakobson he takes this classic appreciation: ""Poetry has from the earliest times engaged in play with suffixes; but only in modern poetry, and particularly in Xlebnikov, has this device become conscious, and as it were legitimate.""  The constraint informing this collection is that the addition or subtraction of a single letter recircuits the semantic stream. For this book he presents complimentary texts—the first, copies of the handwritten pages he prepared for Francesco Conz's Ezra Pound Project (Verona, Italy) depending upon the addition of suffixes; the second, many of the same sequences reversed to discover recircuits revealed through subtraction. These poems cannot be translated, because they exploit possibilities unique to English.  Though Richard Kostelanetz's poetry is uniquely different, his methods are not obscure or unacceptable, acknowledged as they are in several selective histories and encyclopedias of contemporary poetry.

Katherine’s poetry lodges within us like a long lost friend who challenges us, inspires us to ‘wear the rain/ drink the light’, to explore the sometime pleasures, sometime pains, of being here, in this place, right now. I treasure her poems.                                                                     —Wendy Visser, poet, 2007 WRACwinner for Best Book  Any gathering of Katherine L. Gordon’s poetry is a momentous occasion. Translating Shadows will leave you looking at the natural and spiritual worlds with enlightened eyes. There is magic in the place from where the author writes—a place unlike no other and it is from this unique perspective that her wondrous words are woven into an ever-flowing robe of majesty and awe.                                                                                                              —Andreas Gripp, poet, author of Angel Clare  In another time, another life, Katherine L. Gordon would have been a Wise Woman, a Soothsayer, Keeper of the Mysteries of the Gods. Her poems are the entrances to another world: a world beyond the shadows on the cavern wall, a world beyond all time, yet one which marries nature, lore and even modern alchemy. Her remarkable poems are the journeys of the ancients walking in our shoes.                                                                                                            —S.J. White, poet, photographer  Clarity of understanding and a Celtic bard's deep wisdom—both these attest the unique beauty and strength of poet Katherine L. Gordon, hers a poetry residing (as she says of the pioneer woman) ""in ballads of the heart,/or wilderness,/where her spirit lives."" Pioneer herself, mystic, philosopher, attuned to the heart or solar cycles, or presiding over a late-summer valley, she's poet of nature, language and love. But perhaps above all else,  Katherine L. Gordon is the true guardian of a true Canadian poetry, friend and muse  to all those she's inspired and who gather now to celebrate another book of verse.                                                                                                            —Conrad DiDiodato, poet   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A seasonal triptych, the poems root themselves in the landscapes they inhabit: from the boulder fields of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the endless dusk of Clam Gulch, Alaska, to a half-frozen lake in Upstate New York. These poems ask the reader to move inward, to look hard at loss and see it stark and sure. The narrative, often deceptively formal poems, show us the affects domestic tragedies can have on a family’s faith in each other, how absence can color their collective memory. Ultimately, they are poems of hope, artifacts or rescues of some kind. Each one is a small proof that no matter the magnitude of the flood, through remembering there can always be salvage. These poems ask the reader to believe there is something left worth saving.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

New moon,Enriqueta Lunez,poetry,First published in 2019,/works/OL32317096W,/authors/OL6619554A/Enriqueta_Lunez,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Ugly Duckling Presse|Language English|Pages 27,"""Enriqueta Lunez's New Moon carries the sensations and uncertainties of a dusk-filled landscape; traces of shadows obscuring full view of the horizon, of what's ahead, of one's own likeness. The voice of the poems tracks a series of moving targets--""haughty, I take aim,"" she proclaims. Moving deeper into their path, into a fraught multiplicity of voices and faces, mortal concerns intersect with divine as souls and bodies are threatened, misplaced, or desperately sought. With ""no time for lamenting,"" Lunez probes the depths of womanhood, trauma, the earth, and of the soul's place within these divides.""--Provided by publisher.

The author focuses on the emperor Augustus in the poetry of Virgil, detects in the poets and grammarians of antiquity alternately a collaborative oppositional reading and an attempt to suppress such reading, studies creative translation (particularly Dryden's), which reasserts the 'Augustan' Virgil, and examines naive translation which can be truer to the spirit of Virgil. Scrutiny of 'textual cleansing', philology's rewriting or excision of troubling readings, leads to readings by both supporters and opponents of fascism and National Socialism to support or subvert the latter-day Augustus. The book ends with a diachronic examination of the ways successive ages have tried to make the Aeneid conform to their upbeat expectations of this poet.

Spenser's art,Mark Rose,poetry,First published in 1975,/works/OL2809839W?edition=ia%3Aspensersartcompa0000rose,/authors/OL417562A/Mark_Rose,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL5057957M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1975|Publisher  Harvard University Press|Language English|Pages 159,"I have tried to suggest something of Spenser's richness and subtlety through a reading of Book One, following the poem as it develops canto by canto. In general, I have attempted to draw the meaning out of the text, emphasizing that the poem creates its own world of allusion, becoming increasingly suggestive as it proceeds. There are many aspects of the poem, important aspects such as the historical allegory, that I have ignored or slighted. My intention has not been to provide a complete study of Book One, but merely to indicate to the reader who does not come to Spenser equipped with special expertise how much he may gain through a study of the text itself. On the assumption that most readers will find a short book more useful than a longer one, I have tried to keep my discussions as brief as possible. Necessarily this has meant being selective about which passages and details to comment upon, and in a poem such as The Faerie Queene in which every detail is significant any selection is to some degree a distortion of the text. The reader should recognize this at the outset, realizing that another critic's choices of passages for emphasis might be quite different from my own. - Preface.

While the tradition of Asian-American literature and criticism is well-established, there has been less exposure to how China-based critics have viewed the increasing popularity of canonical and emerging American poetry. The volume uses a variety of approaches to argue a central theme--that the ""encounter"" of American poetry with contemporary Chinese modernity is occasioning a radical refashioning of not only American perspectives on Chinese culture and values but of the impact of Western values upon the Chinese worldview""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ballads of the Turf captures in verse and ballad form the real life stories of Damon Runyonesque-type racetrack characters like Bill the Reverend, Chatahoochee Smith and Sheepherder Bill, in a loving look back at their lives, their dreams, and most importantly, their partnership with their horses.    Widely acclaimed by academics, racing historians, horsemen, racing fans, industry leaders, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, these memories that horsemen treasure are vividly captured by the author, who lived among the characters he immortalized in verse.

She went to school in Dodge City and then to the University of Kansas, transferring when invited to a program in economics at Rampart College, in the mountains of Colorado.  She moved to Los Angeles where she spent several years and married. She graduated as a Regents Scholar from the University of California, Berkeley, and earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics there, applying modern formal linguistic theory to the ancient Egyptian language written in hieroglyphic, which she also taught to a generation of UC Berkeley Egyptology students.  Anticipating the coming importance of personal computers, she moved to Silicon Valley to join very early startup software companies as a teacher, writer, and manager of writing groups. During this same period she researched railroad history in travels over all the western states, and was one of a small team who rebuilt and restored the long-dormant Southern Pacific 2472 steam locomotive.  She retired very early and moved with her husband to central London where they lived and studied for ten years, after which they returned to live in San Francisco. She has written poetry since her early college years.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Kith, award-winning writer Divya Victor engages Indian-American diasporic culture in the twentieth century, via an autobiographical account that explores what 'kith' might mean outside of the national boundaries of those people belonging to the Indian and Southeast Asian diasporas. Through an engagement with the effects of globalization on identity formation, cultural and linguistic exchange, and demographic difference, Kith explores questions about race and ethnic difference: How do 'brownness' and 'blackness' emerge as traded commodities in the transactions of globalization? What are the symptoms of belonging? How and why does 'kith' diverge from 'kin,' and what are the affects and politics of this divergence? Historically-placed and wellresearched, Kith is an unflinching and simultaneous account of both systemic and interpersonal forms of violence and wounding in the world today.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Period.”    —The Kenyon Review Online  “Obscenely Yours lives up to its title. . . Virtually every poem in this book explores the body and its grim needs, but this theme never becomes monotonous. . . . Angelo Nikolopoulos  is clearly a poet of the soul every bit as much as a poet of the body.”    —The Antioch Review  “. . .what Nikolopoulos is about here is not (or not only) the pain of knowledge, but its pleasure, and not of knowledge merely, but of experience. And if indecency abounds, as indeed it does, these poems are about the resolute refusal to repress it, indeed, the commitment to insisting upon it. It is this insistence to which the book’s title ultimately gestures, convinced that its minutely enumerated indecencies belong not only to the poet, but to the reader as well, not obscenely mine only but also obscenely yours.”    —Coldfront Magazine  “[Obscenely Yours has] a broad daylight kind of sexuality that is presented tenderly, experimentally, sardonically, in a way that is completely original and yet must also be read as an homage to a generation of gay poets that came before it.”    —Los Angeles Review of Books  “Nikolopoulos writes the poems that lurk in all of us. . .”    —GayLetter  “[Obscenely Yours] examines the anxiety of a normalized queer experience. . . . If it isn’t obvious, Nikolopoulos has no reservations about talking about the body nor getting dirty with it.”    —BOMBlog  “Angelo Nikolopoulos’ debut collection is a masterfully lyrical tribute to gay sexuality. . . [Obscenely Yours] is not defiant, but celebratory, as excited about the pleasures of language as the pleasures of the body.”    —Lambda Literary Review  “Nikolopoulos’ poems read as highly sophisticated, choreographed events—scenes, if you will. The first section of Obscenely Yours. . . encourages us to envision [his] poems as cinematic spectacles. Love is like that, cinematic, that is.”    —Bookslut  “Nikolopoulos’ debut is careful, sexy. . . . The body, its ecstasy and its shame, is this poet’s obsession, and he observes it with a straightforward awe.”    —Publishers Weekly  “Dynamic and dead-on, these poems speak to the urge, the threat, the violent appetite of desire. They also do the hard work of unraveling the question of love—the thing we ‘take on faith…lightly,’ that asks everything and promises only we ‘are not dead.’ Obscenely Yours leads us through the Cineplex of ecstatic language and out into the wilderness of human longing, where we let go the selves we know and become ‘something else entirely.'”    —Tracy K. Smith  “These supple poems are at once frank and mysterious, and they explore desire in a way that feels modern and intelligent. An audacious debut, Obscenely Yours is devilishly candid and definitely scandalous.”    —Edmund White  “I love Angelo Nikolopoulos’ poems—for their embodied electricity, their sophisticated minimalism, their racy scenarios, their tender-hearted reserve. Obscenely Yours has concentrated allure, achieved through sculpted angles, ideal lighting, and a perfectly choreographed compromise between silence and speech. His lines, loaded with edge and drip and torsion, behave like an action painting tucked into the svelte envelope of a Dickinson-tight line. Inebriate of air is Angelo, whose first book is a wonder.”    —Wayne Koestenbaum  “Take the body out, this poet is told, as in erase it. But Angelo Nikolopoulos is smart and rebellious enough to bring the body out instead—out of its inarticulate silence, out of its closet. These poems plunge straightforwardly into the heart of sex: the spirit and hope, terror and boredom, the elation and shame and beauty of the thing itself. A divine spirit that indwells in nature and the universe? Where else would it be, Nikolopoulos asks. Obscenely Yours is a thrilling book: crackingly alive, brilliant and absolutely fearless.”    —Mark Doty   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While for some this may partly remain Oscar Wilde's 'mode of style', this book will show that there is more of Japan in the work of contemporary Irish poets than 'a tinkling of china/and tea into china.' Drawing on unpublished new sources, Irene De Angelis includes poets from a broad range of cultural backgrounds with richly varied styles: Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon, Ciaran Carson and Paul Muldoon, together with younger poets such as Sinéad Morrissey and Joseph Woods. Including close readings of selected poems, this is an indispensable companion for all those interested in the broader historical and cultural research on the effect of oriental literature in modernist and postmodernist Irish poetry.

This is a poetry not of snapshots or collages but of long-exposed captures of the not-so-still lives of women. One sequence imagines Virginia Woolf’s childhood; another unmakes her novel The Waves by attempting to untangle its six overlapping narratives. Yet another, ‘On the Scent,’ makes us flâneurs through the lives of a series of contemporary women, while ‘The River Is All Thumbs’ uses a palette of vibrant repetition to ‘paint’ a landscape.  Queyras’s language – astute, insistent, languorous – repeats and echoes until it becomes hypnotic, chimerical, almost halluncinatory in its reflexivity. How lyrical can prose poetry be? How closely can it mimic painting? Sculpture? Film? How do we make a moment firm? These ‘postmodern,’ ‘postfeminist’ poems pulse between prose and poetry: the line, the line, they seem to ask, must it ever end?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Today some of these poets, such as Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Mayakovsky, Pasternak, and Tsvetaeva, are known around the world. This volume introduces Silver Age poetry with its cultural ferment, the manifestos and the philosophical, religious, and aesthetic debates, the occult references and sexual experimentation, and the emergence of women, Jews, gay and lesbian poets, and peasants as part of a brilliant and varied poetic environment. After a thorough introduction, the volume offers brief biographies of the poets and selections of their work in translation--many of them translated especially for this volume--as well as critical and fictional texts (some by the poets themselves) that help establish the context and outline the lively discourse of the era and its indelible moral and artistic aftermath.

The book is divided into eight sections: ""Fathers,"" ""Brothers, Sons and Other Youth,"" ""Lovers,"" ""Street Scene,"" ""Beacons,"" ""Music-Makers,"" ""In Light and Shadow,"" and ""In This Sad Place."" Each of these section titles is preceded by a group of four portraits drawn by the late Carl Owens.  This is an extremely important book that educates its readers, portraying African American men in many positive ways and denying the stereotypical images that too often prevail. The message is not overshadowed by the fine literary quality of the poems by 55 African American women. The title refers to Ifé, a city in Nigeria which, according to legend, was the birthplace of mankind.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

W. B.

B. Yeats is a writer who requires, and at the same time tests the limits of, contextual study. More than perhaps any other Irish writer, he produced his own context as much as it produced him. His cultural and political activities, combined with his prolific literary output, made an impact that can only be understood by close attention to his words in relation to the times in which he lived. W. B. Yeats in Context maps Yeats's world in concise, lively essays by distinguished critics and historians. The places, people, themes and intellectual frameworks most important to his development receive close attention, as do his artistic influences, and the production and reception of his work.

The book focuses on short poems in dialogue form, semi-dialogic prayers and dramatic monologues, and alleged dialogic configurations of the lyrics, stressing their potential for performance. Devotional dialogues, as between Jesus and Mary, are shown to have the form of mutual begging, in accordance with the central medieval ritual of supplication. Dialogue as heteroglossia provides the basis for readings of selected prayers from Cædmon to Lydgate, highlighting a variety of cultural transactions involved in addressing heaven. Tracing the ways the poems overcome the limits of language in search of transcendent communication leads to insights into vernacular poetics and theology inherent in early English religious verse.""--Publisher's description.

Stevens lived in New York from 1900 to 1916, working briefly as a journalist, going to law school, laboriously starting up a career as a lawyer, getting engaged and married, gradually mixing with local avant-garde circles, and eventually emerging as one of the most exciting and surprising voices in modern poetry. Although he then left the city for a job in Hartford, Stevens never saw himself as a Hartford poet and kept gravitating toward New York for nearly all things that mattered to him privately and poetically: visits to galleries and museums, theatrical and musical performances, intellectual and artistic gatherings, shopping sprees and gastronomical indulgences. Recent criticism of the poet has sought to understand how Stevens interacted with the literary, artistic, and cultural forces of his time to forge his inimitable aesthetic, with its peculiar mix of post-romantic responses to nature and a metropolitan cosmopolitanism. This volume deepens our understanding of the multiple ways in which New York and its various aesthetic attractions figured in Stevens' life, both at a biographical and poetic level""--  ""This unique essay collection considers the impact of New York on the life and works of Wallace Stevens.

The meetings, called Salón de Belleza (Beauty Salon), brought together more than 70 poets and writers from different generations, contexts and traditions, almost all from Mexico and the United States, but also from various parts of Latin America and Europe. In the readings, translation was used to bridge the linguistic and cultural gaps between poets separated by political boundaries and to establish a space where literatures of diverse origins and aesthetics could coexist. The result of this collaboration was a representative sample of some of the most intriguing literary expressions that have taken place in America during the second decade of this century. Salones de belleza: escritores en Aeromoto brings together, in a fully bilingual edition, the work of these writers, many of whom their work was translated for the first time. Editor/curator Kit Schluter (Boston, 1989) is a poet-translator & bookmaker living in Mexico City and curator Tatiana Lipkes is an editor, translator, publisher and poet.

Seely delves into the ways in which family and environment shape us. Poems ranging from terse, meditative lyrics to more direct narratives examine the relationship between what lies visible on the lit surface and what lies just beneath. In addition to first-person autobiographical narratives, there are ekphrastic poems; poems that explore narratives from mythology and religion; and poems based on news reports, radio stories, and audio recordings. Regardless of the approach, the central questions are the same: How do we sense the world we live in? What do the institutions to which we turn for meaning -- family, religion, art, literature, science -- offer us, and in what ways do they fail us? The answers may depend on where we dare to look""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Фактически книга объединяет вместе три ранее     опубликованные книги «Танец Слов»,     «Хрупкость Чувств» и «Письмо Дождя».  Екатерина Яковина пишет о любви и смысле жизни.    Также автора интересуют темы жизни после смерти,    невидимые миры и помощь небес людям. Часто     Екатерина Яковина пишет о дожде, ветре, тишине,     вечности как о реальных персонажах, которые     действуют от своего имени и влияют на ход событий.   The book ""The Touch of Eternity"" presents    poems written by the author for 30 years.    In fact, the book brings together three previously    published books ""Dance of the Words"",    ""Fragility of Feelings"" and ""Letter of Rain"".  Ekaterina Yakovina writes about love and the meaning of life.    The author is also interested in the topics of life after death,    invisible worlds and the help of heaven to people. Often    Ekaterina Yakovina writes about rain, wind, silence,    the eternity as about real characters who    act on their own behalf and influence the course of events.

The result is an open invitation to consider the contours and meanings of Anglophone poetic practice as a mode of interpreting the world, its potential for transforming subjectivity, or something else entirely.

Red Dirt Jesus,Ray McManus,poetry,First published in 2011,/works/OL17111829W,/authors/OL3065952A/Ray_McManus,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25682279M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Marick Press|Pages 60,"Red Dirt Jesus is a triptych of harsh landscapes where a man reflects on what he has gained, what he is offering, and what he must lose. It begins with the relationship between father and son that delicately hinges on the tension between hills and ditches, between past and fiction, between throat and gut. Later the speaker is alone, trying on several narrative personas in order to chisel out an understanding of who he is as he moves away from the delicate and airborne. His story is one of dirt, dust, spit, and bone, and he finds solace in grit, knowing that things can only get worse if he lets them. In the end, McManus articulates the understated victory of giving in rather than giving up. As the speaker finds the distant acceptance of stone and rot, he realizes that the body breaks but the spirit doesn’t.  “ Here is, in the poetry of Ray McManus, an unabashed sense of place, a fully realized belief in the poetic possibilities in the rural South Carolina landscape which, in his hands, eschews the cliché of country quaintness, for a twenty-first century toughness of existence—declining farms, disillusionment, and spiritual disquiet. Yet, curiously, McManus’ vision is tempered by his complete belief in the healing of poetry, the grace of language and the manner in which this art can achieve a sublime transformation of the human experience. These are, simply put, striking poems of formal accomplishment and affirming musicality. ”     — Kwame Dawes, author of most recently Back of Mount Peace and Wheels  “ A unique American voice enters poetry here, emerging from monkey grass and moon, from the ditch between father (or Father) and son (or Son). It is crisp, laconic, parodic, mysterious. It blesses the diesel and the mud-flap sinner. Maybe it is Tom Sawyer's dark sexy side.

These are truth-telling poems that remind us to pay attention: “to the crow on the fencepost. the fly on the ceiling; to sit on a porch and talk to the dead in private...to lick the sky that falls on your lip...” Like the sons who learn to “hold their scythes steady,” Ray McManus observes the world with a steady eye. ”     — Ellen Bass, author of Mules of Love and The Human Line   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Reviews at Amazon.com:    Spirit, Imagination and Art Make this a Compelling Read, December 9, 2003     By A Customer  If you wonder what the world is up to now, you would find this book an irresistible experience. I welcome the voice of a woman, whose homeland, Afghanistan, lies in tatters. The words created by this poet who speaks so clearly, yet with such grace, are a distinctive gift to those who listen. The art work shares visual images that are at times intense and compelling, and at other times soft and charming. Giving voice to passion and wonder, this new collection of poetry and art speaks from the past and through to tomorrow.    What an amazing mind to be able to humanize so much of the world!  On the one hand, it makes it hard for one to run away and think . . . It's someone else's problem.  On the other, so much of the beauty and understanding so thoroughly takes away one's breath. It takes you to the memories, angst, love, and special joy that life brings. So . . . hard to describe fully and with relish and awe this significant new entry into the world of books!  This is a book for those who wish to see the world through a new perspective. I really hesitate to excerpt any of Dr. Gobar's work, but I will, to give a whisper of what she shares. The only word I can think to describe this poem is to say she caresses her memories as she tells us of her birth land, in ""Home."" (excerpt)  "" Would she ever see Bamyan Lake -    the liquid shimmering turquoise blue?    Where Buddha sculptures used to stare . . .     Those peaceful dear old stone pair . . .  And will the children be running     on clover-covered grounds,    starry-eyed,    grubbing,    holding     the utopian skirts of tomorrow . . .    laughing, laughing . . . ?  Several of the poems concern the tragedy of war. One doesn't read ""A Quarter of a century - Imagine"" and ""Hypocrisy"" without    considering where the 20th and 21st centuries have taken us so far. She speaks from a unique personal and cultural perspective which has not been often heard.  With pathos and a deep, deep, understanding, she writes of reaching out to the hearts of children in ""The Portrait in Ink"" and ""Do You Know Me?"" among many others. If there is humanity in any of our hearts, the fragile child she describes speaks to all.  A life well-considered will resonate with many readers as it did with me in poems, ""Dance,"" ""Before the End,"" and ""The Cafe.""  Her life in Europe and in the U.S. is reflected throughout her unique poetry and the art work which speaks eloquently from the pages. The understandings she shares of life as a child and parent suggest levels and nuances that most of us dream we could experience.  This book of 41 poems and 18 prints of Dr. Gobar's paintings is eye-opening and mind-opening.     tapestry, January 5, 2004     By  L. Knoll ""jtknoll"" (Pittsburg, Kansas United States) - See all my reviews  This review is from: The Invisibles: A Collection of Poetry & Artwork (Paperback)     A stunning collection of personal, intimate perspectives in poetry & art that reflect universal truths; told with an uncommon voice. One womans' incredible journey from her childhood home in Afghanistan to her place in the world. Dr. Gobar's book weaves the simple threads of experience in the country of her birth into a rich tapestry that covers all humanity. A rare and extraordinary find!

Poetry and Culture in Middle Kingdom Egypt: A Dark Side to Perfection,R. B. Parkinson,poetry,First published in 2002,/works/OL831240W,/authors/OL70952A/R._B._Parkinson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3951893M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  Continuum|Language English|Pages 393,"The Middle Kingdom (c.1940-1640 BC) was a golden age of Ancient Egyptian writing. This pioneering book is the first comprehensive study of this literary legacy. The status of literature is controversial in many ancient civilizations, and Middle Kingdom poems have often been regarded as propaganda for the ruling dynasty. This study radically reassesses their cultural role, drawing on recent studies of the individual texts, some by the author, and on general developments in literary criticism, to argue that they were entertainments that voiced potentially dissident views while also being integral to elite culture. The book explores literature's status as a differentiated form of discourse, suggesting what social practices made its role possible and offering an innovative model for the reader's engagement with these subtle and complex ancient works. The book also surveys the social and ideological context of literature and proposes readings of the main tales, discourses, and teachings. The conclusion sets the readings in a broad context, while an appendix surveys the entire range of surviving texts.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Prevailing South,Dudley Clendinen,poetry,First published in 1988,/works/OL8311338W,/authors/OL2761895A/Dudley_Clendinen,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8357238M-M.jpg,Publish Date April 1993|Publisher  Longstreet Press|Language English|Pages 246,"When Jimmy Carter was elected President in 1976, pundits hailed the advent of a “New South” and proclaimed an end to a century of separation. Twelve years later, both the Democrats and the Republicans went to the South to select their candidates. Inspired by this historic occasion, The Prevailing South presents some of the region’s foremost writers, historians and thinkers in an important reevaluation of the South and its role in American politics and culture.  C. Vann Woodward, eminent historian and author of The Burden of Southern History, sets the tone for the collection by defining the South’s new relationship with the rest of the country. He writes:  The remaining distinctiveness ... no longer comes at the cost of isolation, withdrawal or intransigence on the part of the South, or rejection and indifference on the part of the rest of the country, as it once did. The South no longer looks to the past for its guidelines, and it faces a future of opportunity and national influence—the promise of once more being wanted and needed.  Sixteen others join him in recording and analyzing this shift in the thinking of Southerners and non-Southerners alike, touching on almost every significant aspect of American life.  Originally commissioned by the Atlanta Journal and Constitution for the Democratic National Convention, The Prevailing South examines a changing South and a changing America at an unprecedented time in our history. Not since the classic I’ll Take My Stand in the thirties has such an impressive group of writers and thinkers turned their attention to the crucial issues raised in this collection.  Alex Haley contributed to The Prevailing South: Life & Politics In A Changing Culture by writing the preface and an essay.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I would be interested to know how you came up with this information.”  Martha Jette, publisher, editor  “I was finally able to download and read Unio Ten and Eon 93 last night [ZENU U ATU]… Wow, Brett... how'd you do that? MAN!!! It's pretty amazing! I mean, it was absolutely enthralling to read. Minutes before I started, I felt the Holy Spirit enter my body in a rush that made my body jerk and sit up straight. After I was reading, I realized why I'd had that experience. I read with fear and trembling for the power of those words could be felt.  I'm impressed. I like the way you went through the Tarot, your references to the Hebrew alphabet and Psalm 119. I have a Bible with those very symbols, with the pages marked. The bookmarkers are pages of notes on the Tarot meanings that I thought might go with each segment of that chapter. And they matched yours. I was astounded!""  Avalon De Witt, psychic, spiritual healer  ZENU U ATU is a collection of writings compiled between 1991 to 1993. From Rosicrucian to Theological systems, based on the merging of symbols, numbers and letters, the purpose of this collection is to demonstrate balance through the union of opposites (Unio Mystica).  Science and Religion, Male and Female, Light and Darkness are perceived as completions of their polarity, not in opposition. Through this union of opposites a third is established, which C.G. Jung appropriately termed as Synergy.

And it is ram-jammed full of poems by KEY. Originally it was conceived and sold as a hardback book. Increasingly KEY has agitated for that brute to be superseded by something more chic; a slimmer, more athletic version that one can slide into a pocket or down a rugby sock. And now here it is.  Within its featherweight pages you will find the vast majority of the same poems as you'll find in its unwieldy predecessor. Poems skewering such thorny issues as sex, pancakes, footy and vodka. But, in order to drum up renewed interest, KEY has also added a new poem. And there are also seven new introductions. And KEY has also been allowed to waddle round the text with his Lamy fountain pen, altering and updating. Improving. Making everything just so. For this: THE PAPERBACK.

With a heightened post-confessional directness, she addresses lost love, sexual violence, and the confrontations of aging. In her characteristic syntactical play, sly slips of meaning, and all-out feminism, Davis hyperconsciously erases the rulebook in this memorable collection.From ""The Poem She Didn't Write"":began when she stoppedbegan in winter and, like everything else, at first, just waited for spring in spring noticed there were lilac branches, but no desire, no need to talk to any angel, to say: sky, dooryard, when summer arrived there was more, but not much nothing really worth noting and then it was winter again-nothing had changed: sky, dooryard, white, frozen was the lake and the lagoon, some froze the ocean (now you erase that) (you cross that out) and so on and so forth. Olena Kalyiak Davis is a first-generation Ukrainian American who was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. Educated at Wayne State University, the University of Michigan Law School, and Vermont College, she is the author of three books of poetry. She currently works as a lawyer in Anchorage, Alaska.

Knopf,              Distributed by Random House|Language English|Pages 75","In this stunning collection, Franz Wright chronicles the journey back from a place of isolation and wordlessness. After a period when it seemed certain he would never write poetry again, he speaks with bracing clarity about the twilit world that lies between madness and sanity, addiction and recovery. Wright negotiates the precarious transition from illness to health in a state of skeptical rapture, discovering along the way the exhilaration of love--both divine and human--and finding that even the most battered consciousness can be good company.  Whether he is writing about his regret for the abortion of a child, describing the mechanics of slander (""I can just hear them  on the telephone and keening  all their kissy little knives""), or composing an ironic ode to himself (""To a Blossoming Nut Case""), Wright's poems are exquisitely precise. Charles Simic has characterized him as a poetic miniaturist, whose ""secret ambition is to write an epic on the inside of a matchbook cover."" Time and again, Wright turns on a dime in a few brief lines, exposing the dark comedy and poignancy of his heightened perception.  Here is one of the poems from the collection:Description of Her EyesTwo teaspoonfuls,and my mind goeseveryone can kiss my ass now--then it's changed,I change my mind.Eyes so sad, and infinitely kind.From the Hardcover edition.

Poetry and Tales,Edgar Allan Poe,poetry,First published in 1984,/works/OL14938064W?edition=ia%3A198400edga,/authors/OL28127A/Edgar_Allan_Poe,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3177461M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1984|Publisher  Library of America,              Literary Classics of the U.S.,              Distributed to the trade in the U.S. and Canada by the Viking Press|Language English|Pages 1408","Read throughout the world, admired by Dostoyevsky and translated by Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe has become a legendary figure, representing the artist as obsessed outcast and romantic failure. His nightmarish visions, shaped by cool artistic calculation, reveal some of the dark possibilities of human experience. His enormous popularity and his continuing influence of literature depend less on legend or vision than on his stylistic and formal accomplishments as a writer of fiction and a great lyric poet.  In this complete and uniquely authoritative Library of America collection, well-known tales of “mystery and imagination” and his best-known verse are collected with early poems, rarely published stories and humorous sketches, and the ecstatic prose poem Eureka.  But his enormous popularity and his continuing influence on literature depend less on legend or vision than on his stylistic and formal accomplishments as a writer of fiction and as a great lyric poet (“always for all lands,” as Yeats said), famous for the sensuous musicality of “To Helen,” “The City in the Sea,” and “Annabel Lee” and for the hypnotic, incantatory rhythms of “The Raven” and “Ulalume.”  “The Fall of the House of Usher” and “The Cask of Amontillado” show Poe’s mastery of Gothic horror; his “The Pit and the Pendulum” is a classic of terror and suspense. He invented the modern detective story, as in “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” and developed the form of science fiction that was to influence, among others, Jules Verne and Thomas Pynchon.  Poe was also adept at the humorous sketch of playful jeu d’esprit, such as “X-ing a Paragraph” or “Never Bet the Devil Your Head.” All his stories reveal his high regard for technical proficiency and for what he called “ratiocination.”  Poe’s fugitive early poems, stories rarely collected (such as “Bon-Bon,” “King Pest,” “Mystification,” and ""The Duc De L’Omelette), his only attempt at drama, ""Politian""—these and much more are included in this comprehensive collection, presented chronologically to show Poe’s development as a writer, his oeuvre culminates in his vision of an indeterminate universe, Eureka: A Prose Poem, his culminating vision of an indeterminate universe, printed here for the first time as Poe revised it and intended it should stand.  A special feature of this volume is the care taken to select an authoritative text of each work. The printing and publishing history of every item has been investigated in order to choose a version that incorporates all of Poe’s own revisions without reproducing the errors or changes introduced by later editors. Here, then, is one of America’s and the world’s most disturbing, powerful, and inventive writers published in “the first truly dependable collection of Poe’s poetry and tales.”    --jacket   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the Hospital  *My mother was in the hospital & everyone wanted to be my friend.    But I was busy making a list: good dog, bad citizen, short    skeleton, tall mocha. Typical Tuesday.    My mother was in the hospital & no one wanted to be her friend.    Everyone wanted to be soft cooing sympathies. Very reasonable    pigeons. No one had the time & our solution to it    was to buy shinier watches. We were enamored with    what our wrists could declare. My mother was in the hospital    & I didn't want to be her friend. Typical son. Tall latte, short tale,    bad plot, great wifi in the atypical café. My mother was in the hospital    & she didn't want to be her friend. She wanted to be the family    grocery list. Low-fat yogurt, firm tofu. She didn't trust my father    to be it. You always forget something, she said, even when    I do the list for you.

They also may be the most often argued-over sequence of love poems in any language to date. But what is it that continues to elude us? While it is in part the spellbinding incantations, the hide-and-seek of sound and meaning, it is also the mystery of the noble youth to whom he makes a promise -- the promise that he will survive in the breath and speech and minds of all of those who ever read these sonnets. 'How can such promises be fulfilled if no name is actually given?' Scarry asks, and this book is the answer. Naming Thy Name lays bare William Shakespeare's devotion to a beloved whom he not only names but names repeatedly in a love affair immortalized in the microtexture of the sonnets, in their overarching architecture, and in their deep fabric. By naming his name, Scarry enables us to hear clearly a lover's call and the beloved's response for the very first time. Here, over the course of many poems, are two poets in conversation, in love, speaking and listening, writing and writing back. In a true work of alchemy, Elaine Scarry, one of America's most innovative and passionate thinkers, brilliantly synthesizes textual analysis, literary criticism, and historiography in pursuit of the haunting call and recall of Shakespeare's verse, and that of his (now at last named) beloved friend.""--  ""A fascinating case for the identity of Shakespeare's beautiful young man""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet ever since the discovery of these hieroglyphs in 1881, they have been misconstrued by Western Egyptologists as a garbled collection of primitive myths and incantations, relegating to obscurity their radiant fusion of philosophy, scientific inquiry, and religion. Now, in a seminal work, the classicist and linguist Susan Brind Morrow has recast the Pyramid Texts as a coherent work of art, arguing that they should be recognized as a formative event in the evolution of human thought. In The Dawning Moon of the Mind she explains how to read hieroglyphs, contextualizes their evocative imagery, and interprets the entire poem. The result is a magisterial religious and philosophical text revealing a profound consciousness of the world with astonishing parallels to Judeo-Christian culture, Buddhism, and Tantra. More than twenty years in the making, The Dawning Moon of the Mind is a monumental achievement that locates one of the origins of poetic thought in Western culture. Almost before science, art, and written language, these texts set forth the relationship between time and eternity, life and death, history and ideas. In The Dawning Moon of the Mind they emerge in their original luminosity and intelligence alongside a persuasive argument for their central importance to the history of language""--  ""A stunning and original interpretation of an ancient system of poetic, religious, and philosophical thought""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Byron And The Forms Of Thought,Anthony Howe,poetry,First published in 2013,/works/OL17477321W,/authors/OL388784A/Anthony_Howe,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26063371M-M.jpg,Publish Date 20130920|Publisher  Liverpool University Press,"Byron and the Forms of Thought is a major new study of Byron as a poet and thinker. While informed by recent work on Byron’s philosophical contexts, the book questions attempts to describe Byron as a philosopher of a particular kind. It approaches Byron, rather, as a writer fascinated by the different ways of thinking philosophy and poetry are taken to represent.  After an Introduction that explores Byron’s reception as a thinker, the book moves to a new reading of Byron’s scepticism, arguing for a close proximity, in Byron’s thought, between epistemology and poetics. This is explored through readings of Byron’s efforts both as a philosophical poet and writer of critical prose. The conclusions reached form the basis of an extended reading of Don Juan as a critical narrative that investigates connections between visionary and political consciousness. What emerges is a deeply thoughtful poet intrigued and exercised by the possibilities of literary form.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 426,"""The untold story of the mother and daughter who opened the door to Emily Dickinson's poetry. Emily Dickinson may be the most widely read and beloved of all American poets, but the story behind her work's initial, posthumous publication in 1890 and the mother-and-daughter team most responsible for her enduring legacy are barely known. After Emily recounts the extraordinary lives of Mabel Loomis Todd and her daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, and the powerful literary legacy they shared. Mabel's complicated relationships with the Dickinsons--including her thirteen-year extramarital affair with Emily's brother, Austin--roiled the small town of Amherst, Massachusetts. Mabel and Austin's love led to her work with Emily Dickinson's poetry, which inspired both Mabel's life and her daughter's, and fed controversies over the poetry's promotion, editing, and ownership. Julie Dobrow has unearthed hundreds of primary sources to tell this compelling narrative and reveal the surprising impact Mabel and Millicent had on the Emily Dickinson we know today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It focuses on three principal realms of interest — the ethical-political, the aesthetic, and the historical — which are accented in the subtitle as law, form, and event. Lyotard recasts questions relating to justice, philosophy, and Kantian aesthetics in such a way that they take on a new vitality and critical importance.    ""Peregrinations"" has been hailed as one of the most significant theoretical texts of recent years. It is both an ideal introduction to his work and a complex critical reevaluation of his entire theoretical oeuvre.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Eliot's enigmatic poem.  It relates The Waste Land to earlier and later poems by Eliot, demonstrating that the major poems describe a continuous spiritual odyssey or quest undertaken by the same individual, initiated by the moment of ecstasy in the Hyacinth garden.  Blistein's analysis of Eliot's sources reveals that the protagonist's glimpse of ""the heart of light"" is equivalent to drinking from the Grail or communing with God.  The incarnate deity momentarily transforms the Hyacinth garden into the likeness of the  Edenic paradise.  With the inevitable passing of the moment of communion, the protagonist is in effect expelled from the paradisiacal garden as mankind was from Eden.  By contrast, the familiar world appears to him a wasteland.  The protagonist seeks to drink again from the divine Source and return again tsos the garden as it was when transfigured by the divine presence.  His is a quest for Grail and Homeland.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 83,"HAZMAT, meaning “hazardous material,” is an abbreviation familiar from signs at the entrances to long dark tunnels or on the sides of suspicious containers. Here, in a series of stunning poems, J. D. McClatchy examines the first hazmat we all encounter: our own bodies. The virtuosic “Tattoos” meditates on why we decorate the body’s surface, while other poems plunge daringly inward, capturing the way in which everything that makes us human–desire and decay, need and curiosity, the jarring sense of loss and mortality–hovers in the flesh. In the midst of it all is the heart, its treacheries, its gnawing grievances, its boundless capacities.  With their stark titles (“Cancer,” “Feces,” “Jihad”), McClatchy’s poems work dazzling variations on this book’s theme: how we live with the fact that we will die. Crowned by the twenty-part sequence “Motets,” which deals out an exquisite hand of emotional crises, this collection brings us a sumptuous weave of impassioned thought and clear-sighted feeling. Holding up a powerful poetic mirror, McClatchy shows us our very selves in a chilling series of images: the melodrama of the body being played out, as it must be, in the theater of the spirit.

Almost complete poems,Stanley Moss,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20053527W,/authors/OL396023A/Stanley_Moss,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27334188M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 594,"Moss is o ceanic: his poems rise, crest, crash, and rise again like waves. His voice   echoes the boom of the Old Testament, the fluty trill of Greek mythology, and the gongs of Chinese rituals as he writes about love, nature, war, oppression, and the miracle of language. He addresses the God of the Jews, of the Christians, and of the Muslims with awe and familiarity, and chants to lesser gods of his own invention. In every surprising poem, every song to life, beautiful life, Moss, by turns giddy and sorrowful, expresses a sacred sensuality and an earthy holiness. Or putting it another way: here is a mind operating in open air, unimpeded by fashion or forced thematic focus, profoundly catholic in perspective, at once accessible and erudite, inevitably compelling. All of which is to recommend Moss's ability to participate in and control thoroughly these poems while resisting the impulse to center himself in them. This differentiates his beautiful work from much contemporary breast-beating. Moss is an artist who embraces the possibilities of exultation, appreciation, reconciliation, of extreme tenderness. As such he lays down a commitment to a common, worldly morality toward which all beings gravitate.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

That healing conscious is spoken word. In particular it focuses on the social and cultural impact the HIV/AIDS pandemic is having on the black community as it races across the country and around the globe.  Fact: There are over 42 million people around the world infected with the HIV/AIDS disease. (29 million are in Africa) In the United States approximately a half a million people have already died and another million are living with HIV/AIDS. In recent years, African Americans have been over 50% of the new reported cases, and the virus is continuing to spread.  Mindful Messages ""breaks the silence"" and sends an urgent message of ""mindful intervention"" to all African American parents and teens advocating abstinence and safe sex to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  Mindful Messages brings awareness on the issues of peer pressure, sexuality and relationships and the need for more sex education (life skills) training and information to empower African American youth. It also points out the consequences of not intervening. The book also explains how alcohol and drugs can contribute to ""at risk"" behavior and the rise in HIV/AIDS and other STDs in the black community. And it seeks more awareness and compassion for those African and African Americans who are living with the HIV/AIDS disease.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book of poems by Wendy Visser is one that you will want to hold on to and re-read for years to come. Indeed, Wendy's poetry has been delighting both other writers and poetry fans for many years because of the quality of her writing. Wendy's poetry is clever and intelligent, fun and philosophical, poignant and pointed, and it always has the ring of truth to it. One moment she is writing poems about family that go deep and and touch roots we all share, and then her wicked sense of humour takes us on a voyage that careens from hol(e)y sex to a morbid fear of airbags. That's one of Wendy's secret strengths—you never know where she's going next, but you can be cerain that the ride will be worth it. No esoteric, effete poems about rare paintings on museum walls—these are real poems about real people. I think they're great and I hope you will too. Enjoy!!""

The book’s locus is Chung Luong, birthplace of Weigl’s Vietnamese daughter, Hanh, and one of the poorest and most beautiful places on earth. That vivid contrast, between beauty and utter poverty, is what drives this book, allowing the poet to view the collapse of empire—one of the book’s central themes—from a new psychic vantage. While these tough, retrospective poems break into a new realm of compassion and forgiveness, they are just as steely and truth-telling as any of his earlier works, which were brilliant explorations of the damages of war and the violent potential of the human imagination.  But readers of Weigl’s past books (among them Song of Napalm, What Saves Us, The Monkey Wars) and his critically acclaimed memoir, The Circle of Hanh, will recognize the distance he has traveled. As he himself has put it, “I began to feel as if I might try to assume some kind of public voice, so that these poems feel to me as if they’re the most mature I’ve written. What drives the form is the attitude, and what drives the attitude is the particular take on diction; a kind of free-wheeling American-like regard for how words mean and how they feel in your mouth when you say them. I’ve never said the phrase ‘this is my best book ever,’ but I can say it here because I know it is and I know what it took to get there.”   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|2 Currently reading|0 Have read

As part of a lyric experimental tradition, My Mojave is also balkily anti-lyric, interrupting its most flowing effects on purpose. Drawing on the terms of late modernist enterprise to re-invent and re-use poetic form as an indicator of consciousness, Revell brings to us descriptions of the natural world, songlike fragments, declarations that resemble riddles, and musings on poetry and the soul.”    —Brenda Hillman, in her judges’ citation for the Lenore Marshall Prize  “Revell is a writer of singular talent and ambition…he takes the reader to unfamiliar and strange places and, in the process, he creates some of the most beautiful poetry in our language.”    —Harvard Review  “A rich and rewarding read, My Mojave shows Revell to be an increasingly important poet for our times.”    —The Antioch Review   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And his keen, sensitive observations make for precise, sensuous and elegant poetry. It is thus not surprising that he is also a connoisseur of Franz Joseph Haydn's chamber music. I warmly recommend David Jaffin's books.""--Wolfgang Binder, University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany"""" """"Everything about these books underlines the classical nature of his art ... Jaffin's work, it seems to me, represents the area from which any poetic revival will have to start ... Jaffin's language is highly abstracted, sharp and original. This is not easy poetry: it is the product of American energy and Judaic sensibility, it is intelligent and demanding.""--The late Michael Butler, University of Birmingham, England"""" """"Dream Flow is a substantial collection of David Jaffin's poetry. At 311 pages, it's an inexhaustible well in which one can gaze and dip at one's leisure, bringing reflective waters to the lips. To say these poems reveal the extent of the intricate word-play and the shimmer of meanings. And the more one sees and says the more the subtle gifts keep coming.""--Jassie Glass, Mekai University, Tokyo, Japan"""" """"On Dream Flow David Jaffin is a prolific American poet whose work uses the minimum possible means of expression in order to reach for essentials in his subject matter ... The limpid texture of his work resists quotation or excerption; his deceptively simple surfaces use the tensions inherent in the vocabulary to open up new horizons. Delicate creations, his poems tend to be wonderfully light lyrics.""--www.bogpriser.dk, Denmark""""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Utilising his renowned observational humour and playing with the absurdist nature of institutional language, Stavanger interrogates the unreliable narration of diagnosis: in private, in public and in surrealist spaces where it becomes increasingly unclear who is under the microscope. In short character studies, informal experiments and longer sequenced poems this collection unpacks toxic masculinity and fatherhood, online and domestic tensions, the truth of confessional poetry, myths of 'madness' inherited by blood, and the canine as both avatar and familiar of the black dog.

Manley's formal education ended after high school when he joined the workforce as a church sexton in Schenectady. A voracious reader, he went on to educate himself widely on history and politics and to indulge his love for poetry. Martin also dedicated his life to activism, fighting for peace and social justice in his community, the nation and the world. A well-known figure as he rides his bicycle around his urban neighborhood, he also revels in the beauty of nature. Only his closest friends knew that Martin was also writing poetry. These fresh, incisive, thought-provoking pieces, written between 1973 and 2014, contain musings on the world's turmoil, insights into relationships, and analysis of the human condition. With wry humor and lyrical descriptions, they reflect the life and thoughts of an unusual man.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Allie, Jr. demonstrates intense concern with the power of emotion in this book of verse, As the World Burns. In the first poem, ""Life,"" the poet finds his true life within himself only in the glow of ""the one who came so that my soul shall not die."" The next poem, ""The Precipice,"" looks into the depths of man-made destruction. The verse ""Common Bondage,"" ponders the nature of injustice, and in ""The Storm,"" the poet conveys a sense of the power and pain of strong emotions. The poem ""Dismantled Spirit,"" describes some ambivalent emotions. Poems that voice feelings of anger and love, confusion and certainty, along with an abiding awareness of spirituality and social concerns.  A native of Detroit, Michigan, ZAMOUNDE S.ALLIE, JR. is a staff sergeant with the U.S. Air Force. His religion has fluctuated from Islam to Christianity, but first he had to find God in himself. Man, he feels, seems to get caught up in too many specifics and falls short of knowing his spiritual side. He himself, the author says, made many mistakes growing up, mostly through following the wrong crowd. No longer a crowd follower, he now makes his own decisions from the heart.

The first part is a collection of thematically linked poems exploring Blackness and the myriads of issues it attracts. The second part oscillates themes-- talking about consent, a query of death, a celebration of love among others. In his usual stylistic, this collection deals with weighty matters like race and colourism with simple and clear language.In Black ≠ Inferior, we see Tolu' Akinyemi reacting in response to the world, to issues that affect Black people. Here, we see a poet shedding off his burdens through his poems; hence, the beauty of this collection is in the issues it attempts to address. In this collection, Tolu' wears a coat of many colours - he is a preacher, a prophet, a doctor and a teacher.We see Tolu' the preacher in these lines: 'I wish you can rise through the squalor of poverty and voices that watercolour you as under-represented.I wish you can emblaze your name in gold, and swim against every wave of hate.' This is a collection of poems fit for the present narrative as any (Black) person who reads this collection should beam with confidence at the end. This is what the poet sets out to achieve with his oeuvre.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Meet Robinson, the protagonist of Kathleen Rooney's brilliant novel-in-poems ROBINSON ALONE. Conjured up by Weldon Kees and set loose in an urban landscape, Robinson reflects and refracts mid-century American kitsch, optimism, and despair. 'What do you / think the post-war world will be like?' he asks, via Rooney's revisions and erasures of Kees' own letters. Lyrical and detailed, precise and ornate, Rooney's genre-bending text showcases an obsession with literary history. At once repulsed by Midwestern provincialism and fearful of urban excess, 'There's still as much of yesterday / as there is of tomorrow in all he does today.'""?Carol Guess ""Kathleen Rooney is one of the best writers of her still youthful generation. Whether working in memoir, essay, fiction, or verse, she writes in a style that is strikingly original and immediately recognizable for the high-spirited energy of its surface and an undertow of emotion that is sometimes elegiac. Even when part of the art in this book is that of the ventriloquist, both of these qualities can be found in Rooney's Robinson poems, a sustained work based on her long engagement with the poetry of Weldon Kees. Kees was for a long time a poet's poet for a generation now itself growing old, so it is a fine thing to have his signature character examined and re-animated by a young poet as good as Rooney is.""?John Matthias ""Kathleen Rooney's ROBINSON ALONE is a blood brother to the historical novel. She reminds us that epic stories started with the poem, and she does the tradition proud with her formal flexibility and attention to detail. Her poems 'photograph the obscure, ' uncovering a lost treasure in Weldon Kees, who apparently is alive and well, living between these pages.""?A. Van Jordan ""Weldon Kees is one of the more mysterious figures in American arts. Born in Nebraska in 1914, he followed his polymorphous muse from coast to coast as a musician, librarian, writer, screenwriter, critic, and painter. He is remembered most for his poetry, and for his disappearance. Did he leap to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge in July 1955 or seek a new life in Mexico? In an extraordinary act of identification, poet and essayist Rooney (For You, For You I Am Trilling These Songs (Counterpoint, 2010)) improvises on Kees's most haunting poems, a quartet featuring an alter ego named Robinson. Her loosely biographical, knowledgeably imaginative, and gorgeously atmospheric story in verse portrays Robinson as a dapper, talented, and bedeviled man who conceals his sorrows behind insouciance. Rooney weaves lines from Kees's writings into her bluesy, funny, and scorching lyrics as she follows Robinson from elation to desolation as his wife succumbs to alcoholism and his dreams fade. Rooney's syncopated wordplay, supple musicality, and cinematic descriptions subtly embody Kees's artistic pursuits as well as Robinson's sardonic grace under pressure. An intricate, psychologically luminous homage, tale of American loneliness, and enthralling testament to poetry's resonance.""?Donna Seaman, Booklist starred review.
