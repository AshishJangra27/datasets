With each chapter revolving around a single theme--Narratives, Sinais, Zions, Messiahs, Laws, Mysticisms, Cultures, Movements, Genocides, Powers, Borders, and Futures--this introductory textbook interrogates readers' understanding of the Jewish community. Written for a new mode of teaching--one that recognizes the core role that identity formation plays in our lives--this book weaves together alternative, marginalized voices to illustrate how Jews have always been in the process of reshaping their customs, practices, and beliefs. Judaisms is the first book to assess and summarize Jewish history from the time of the Hebrew Bible through today using multiple perspectives""--Provided by publisher.

DEVELOPING A MINISTRY IN THE 67TH EVACUATION HOSPITAL AMONG NURSING PERSONNEL SUFFERING STRESS AND DISTRESS,Tommy Herold Marlowe,religion,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264700W,/authors/OL5356958A/Tommy_Herold_Marlowe,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 242,"Medical staff suffer physical, psychological, and theological problems due to stress. This is especially true of health care personnel in a military hospital where the whole person is taxed to the limits of his/her existence. Stress had become an acute factor in causing low morale, inefficiency, and deterioration of work performance and family and interpersonal relationships.  The purpose of developing a ministry for the medical staff was to provide pastoral care as they practiced their respective professions in health care. This was accomplished by using the theological constructs of Seward Hiltner, a pastor and theologian: Shepherding, Communicating, and Organizing. The project also included healing, guiding, and sustaining which Hiltner incorporated in his theology of pastoral care.  The project was carried out with the medical staff on Ward 2-B (experimental group) and Ward 3-B (control group) of the 67th Medical Company, USAMEDDAC Wurzburg, Germany. Pastoral care was administered to staff personnel on Ward 2-B using the concept of Shepherding through individual counseling, in service or group counseling, visitation, and prayer. Communicating took place in a classroom setting, counseling, worship, and interpretation of personality testing.  The central idea of organizing, according to Hiltner, ""is fellowship, the process by which an association becomes a body and then acts like a body."" Organizing this fellowship, in this sense the church, may be seen in three aspects: (1) nourishing, feeding or aiding in the development of the fellowship of the church; (2) protecting or purifying it from threats within or without; and (3) relating it positively or negatively, to other bodies such as institutions, cultures, or states. Ward 3-B, (control group), experienced the same schedule of training and environment of health care as Ward 2-B, (experimental group), but was not exposed to this perspective model of ministry.  The experimental group was compared to the control group by using data from stress tests, a questionnaire, observation, consultation, and feedback from other participants. The results have indicated that this model of ministry can be administered to persons who suffer stress and feel alienated from the Creator, have poor interpersonal relationships, and feel a sense of low-worth.

"NURSES AND THEIR RELIGIOUS FAITH AS A COPING MECHANISM IN DEALING WITH TERMINAL PATIENTS AND THEIR DEATH (GRIEF, LOSS, HOSPITALIZATION)",Cullene Evelyn Bryant,religion,First published in 1985,/works/OL12262232W,/authors/OL5354775A/Cullene_Evelyn_Bryant,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1985|Pages 118,"As Director of Pastoral Care in a large tertiary care hospital, I have become aware of the stress nurses experience when patients die. The purpose of this project was to explore the faith structure operative in nurses who work with residential terminal patients and to discover a possible correlation between their faith and their attitude to death as they cope with terminal patients.  I interviewed nurses who worked at the Mewburn Veterans Centre, U of A Hospitals, which is a geriatric centre for men. There was a high rate of absenteeism because of the stress level, one of these being grief reaction. The question I became concerned to raise as chaplain and researcher was: Does religious faith provide a coping mechanism for nurses who deal with terminal patients? Through a focused interview I explored the role and function of faith and how this affects attitudes towards the death of patients. The data was transcribed and analyzed according to themes. The framework for sorting the data was Fowler's criteria for faith.  All the nurses interviewed believed that religious faith helped them cope with dying patients. The nurses presented two images of God, a distant God who controls and orders life and time of death and a close imminent person. Expression of faith through moral acts was very important to the nurses as a criteria for faith. Related to this legalistic attitude was the theme of aloneness and need for reconciliation. Jesus' life, death, and resurrection was largely absent as the core of faith. Implications for pastoral care are that the nurses might receive even more comfort from their faith life if they understand God as one who like them is vulnerable and has experienced suffering.  This study was a pilot project. Further research could explore doctors' attitudes towards terminal patients and how their faith affects their responses. Another study could explore nurses on an emergency unit and their attitude towards death. Another possibility would be to compare attitudes about death among respondents who represent other faiths. In conclusion this thesis project opens up a rich field of research about attitudes towards death.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"PASTORAL CARE FOR ISOLATED NURSING CENTER RESIDENTS IN A GROUP SETTING (RELATIONSHIPS, COMMUNALITY, INTERPERSONAL, ESTRANGEMENT)",Warren Louis Treuer,religion,First published in 1986,/works/OL12263110W,/authors/OL5355535A/Warren_Louis_Treuer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1986|Pages 235,"This Thesis Project deals with the problem of residents in a Nursing Center who volitionally sit in solitary loneliness many hours of every day without involvement in activities or with other individuals.  Their isolation is a distortion of the communality basic to human beings. As such, the restoration of satisfying relationships, in community, was considered possible, necessary and theologically appropriate.  The ""in house"" aspect of this goal was considered important because visitation by family, clergy and friendly visitors is sporadic, even under the best conditions. The formulation of a group was conceived as a possible basis for achieving the objective of establishing warm, personal relationships and involving individuals in community.  The basic Project hypothesis notes that ""if it is possible to form warm, caring relationships with them (residents) as individuals, it will be possible to restore communality, through group relationships, for approximately one-third of the isolated residents."".  The approach taken was to determine which of the isolated residents would welcome regular visits by the Project author, and to visit with them one to four times each week for three months. Following that Personal Relationship phase, a Working Relationship phase of one month involved acquainting each individual with at least one other resident. The final phase, Group Relationships, involved meeting in groups, once a week, for three months.  Twenty-two individuals, of the twenty-nine residents initially approached, began the Project. Due to various attritions, some residents were replaced by other isolated residents but, ultimately, eleven individuals participated in one of two groups with considerable regularity. During the three months of group life, the Group Journal notes the establishment of significant and enjoyable interpersonal relationships. Unsolicited institutional input corroborated the Project findings, that significant changes had taken place in the eleven individuals during the three months of group life.  Further research is necessary involving isolated persons in all categories. It is possible to reduce isolation, but it requires many more person hours than are now generally committed to this problem. Possible sources are volunteers (students, retired persons) or chaplains (CPE students). The other necessity is an organized effort to channel individual efforts toward communal goals.

DEVELOPING A MODEL OF VOLUNTEER CHAPLAINCY AND PASTORAL CARE MINISTRIES TO NURSING HOME FACILITIES,"Holland, Burke Elmo Jr.",religion,First published in 1986,/works/OL12263524W,/authors/OL5355892A/Holland_Burke_Elmo_Jr.,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1986|Pages 218,"This project is designed to bring a balanced program of pastoral care ministries to nursing home facilities. The program design makes available counseling and clergy skills through a volunteer chaplain or chaplains. It also makes available many other areas of pastoral care through the involvement of local church groups. These groups are organized by a steering committee to provide a balanced program of care to the residents according to needs.  Chapter I identifies the mission challenge nursing home facilities offer the church. The increasing number of elderly people in today's population provide an equally increasing number of elderly who will need institutionalized care. This chapter identifies the major health problems that cause these persons to need institutionalized care. Social and spiritual needs are likewise identified. Chapter II focuses on the biblical and theological foundations that challenge the church to such a caring ministry. The role and nature of the Servant People is explored as a theological basis for ""call."" Chapter III explores the planning process of the project. Existing programs are reviewed, the process for local participation is developed, the nursing facility that will provide the model is chosen, and a steering committee is selected. Chapter IV details the work of the Steering Committee as it develops the model through six meetings. Chapter V describes a three-month monitoring process of the model as the project is activated. Chapter VI reviews the evaluations made following the three-month monitoring process.  The project verifies the need for the variety of pastoral care ministries that are provided by volunteer chaplains and church groups administered by an organized program.

Negotiating the Sacred II,Elizabeth Burns Coleman,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL23498305W,/authors/OL2830292A/Elizabeth_Burns_Coleman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  ANU Press|Pages 210,"Blasphemy and other forms of blatant disrespect to religious beliefs have the capacity to create significant civil and even international unrest. Consequently, the sacrosanctity of religious dogmas and beliefs, stringent laws of repression and codes of moral and ethical propriety have compelled artists to live and create with occupational hazards like uncertain audience response, self-censorship and accusations of deliberate misinterpretation of cultural production looming over their heads. Yet, in recent years, issues surrounding the rights of minority cultures to recognition and respect have raised new questions about the contemporariness of the construct of blasphemy and sacrilege. Controversies over the aesthetic representation of the sacred, the exhibition of the sacred as art, and the public display of sacrilegious or blasphemous works have given rise to heated debates and have invited us to reflect on binaries like artistic and religious sensibilities, tolerance and philistinism, the sacred and the profane, deification and vilification. Endeavouring to move beyond ‘simplistic’ points about the rights to freedom of expression and sacrosanctity, this collection explores how differences between conceptions of the sacred can be negotiated. It recognises that blasphemy may be justified as a form of political criticism, as well as a sincere expression of spirituality. But it also recognises that within a pluralistic society, blasphemy in the arts can do an enormous amount of harm, as it may also impair relations within and between societies.  This collection evolved out a two-day conference called ‘Negotiating the Sacred: Blasphemy and Sacrilege in the Arts’ held at the Centre for Cross Cultural Research at The Australian National University in November 2005. This is the second volume in a series of five conferences and edited collections on the theme ‘Negotiating the Sacred’. The first conference, ‘Negotiating the Sacred: Blasphemy and Sacrilege in a Multicultural Society’ was held at The Australian National University’s Centre for Cross-Cultural Research in 2004, and published as an edited collection by ANU E Press in 2006. Other conferences in the series have included Religion, Medicine and the Body (ANU, 2006), Tolerance, Education and the Curriculum (ANU, 2007), and Governing the Family (Monash University, 2008). Together, the series represents a major contribution to ongoing debates on the political demands arising from religious pluralism in multicultural societies.

The Cambridge history of religions in America,Stephen J. Stein,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL15981165W,/authors/OL769947A/Stephen_J._Stein,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24886249M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 2736,"The three volumes of The Cambridge History of Religions in America trace the historical development of religious traditions in America, following both their transplantation from other parts of the world and the inauguration of new religious movements on the continent of North America. This story involves complex relationships among these religious communities as well as the growth of distinctive theological ideas and religious practices. The net result of this historical development in North America is a rich religious culture that includes representatives of most of the world's religions. Volume 1 extends chronologically from prehistoric times until 1790, a date linked to the formation of the United States as a nation. The first volume provides background information on representative Native American traditions as well as on religions imported from Europe and Africa. Diverse religious traditions in the areas of European settlement, both Christian and non-Christian, became more numerous and more complex with the passage of time and with the accelerating present. Tension and conflict were also evident in this colonial period among religious groups, triggered sometimes by philosophical and social differences, other times by distinctive religious beliefs and practices. The complex world of the eighteenth century, including international tensions and conflicts, was a shaping force on religious communities in North America, including those on the continent both north and south of what became the United States. Volume 2 focuses on the time period from 1790 until 1945, a date that marks the end of the Second World War. One result of the religious freedom mandated by the Constitution was the dramatic expansion of the religious diversity in the new nation, and with it controversy and conflict over theological and social issues increased among denominations. Religion, for example, played a role in the Civil War. The closing decades of the nineteenth century witnessed the rising prominence of Roman Catholicism and Judaism in the United States as well as the growth of a variety of new religious movements, some that were products of the national situation and others that were imported from distant parts of the globe. Modern science and philosophy challenged many traditional religious assumptions and beliefs during this century and a half, leading to a vigorous debate and considerable controversy. By the middle of the twentieth century, religion on the North American continent was patterned quite differently in each of the three nations – the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Volume 3 examines the religious situation in the United States from the end of the Second World War to the second decade of the twenty-first century, contextualized in the larger North American continental context. Among the forces shaping the national religious situation were suburbanization and secularization. Conflicts over race, gender, sex, and civil rights were widespread among religious communities. During these decades, religious organizations in the United States formulated policies and practices in response to such international issues as the relationship with the state of Israel, the controversy surrounding Islam in the Middle East, and the expanding presence of Asian religious traditions in North America, most notably Buddhism and Hinduism. Religious controversy also accompanied the rise of diverse new religious movements often dismissed as “cults,” the growth of mega-churches and their influence via modern technologies, and the emergence of a series of ethical disputes involving gay marriage and abortion. By the turn of the twenty-first century, the national and international religious contexts were often indistinguishable. - Publisher.

How can we distinguish it from theology on the one hand and the psychology/sociology of religious belief on the other? What does it mean to describe God as 'eternal'? And should religious people want there to be good arguments for the existence of God, or is religious belief only authentic in the absence of these good arguments?  In this 'Very Short Introduction' Tim Bayne introduces the field of philosophy of religion, and engages with some of the most burning questions that philosophers discuss. Considering how 'religion' should be defined, and whether we even need to be able to define it in order to engage in the philosophy of religion, he goes on to discuss whether the existence of God matters. Exploring the problem of evil, Bayne also debates the connection between faith and reason, and the related question of what role reason should play in religious contexts. Shedding light on the relationship between science and religion, Bayne finishes by considering the topics of reincarnation and the afterlife.

Raised in a nonreligious Jewish family, London knew his heritage but had no strong desire to experience it personally. He even spent much of his teen years pretending not to be Jewish. But in the summer of 2004, while doing relief work with children in Bosnia, he stumbled upon a community the likes of which he had not seen before-where Jews worked alongside Muslims and Christians to rebuild a city ravaged by war. London liked this idea of a humanitarian Judaism, and though he didn't realize it at the time, this encounter gave him the idea for a journey that would take him around the world and back to his roots.The Jews' frequent flights from persecution have seen the establishment of communities in some of the most surprising places, and despite efforts by Israel to bring these scattered people home to Zion, many have chosen to remain in the land of their birth. From a shopkeeper selling Jewish trinkets in Iran, to a Hanukkah celebration in an Arkansas bowling alley; from Rangoon, where a fifty-seven-year-old chain-smoking caretaker keeps watch over an all-but-forgotten synagogue, to an engineering professor in Cuba proud of his Jewish heritage, yet even prouder of his Communist ideals, pockets of the Diaspora endure, despite intense pressure to flee. Their decision to stay put offers hope that peace may lie not in congregating behind borders but in the promise of a global community of neighbors.Far from Zion is the story of these Jews in far-flung places, and it's through their experiences that London examines his own identity. As he explores widespread Jewish communities struggling with their relationship to the larger world, he too grapples with his heritage and comes to terms with his own connection to Zion.

In India there is a long history of interaction between them. In this helpful book, Andrew Wingate shares something of that from his direct experience of living in Tamil Nadu. But the growing economic power of India and of the Indian diaspora throughout the world, reveal how little written material is available about Hindus and Christians as they encounter each other outside India. The Meeting of Opposites? is founded upon experience and research, as well as recent meetings with Hindus, especially in the UK, the United States, and Sweden. The author gives many examples of dialogue and focuses on theological, spiritual, and missiological questions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation, he explains why race does not really exist; evaluates the true promise and peril of genetically modified food; reveals how new species are born, in a dog kennel and in a London subway; takes a stroll through 4.5 billion years of time; and explores the new search for alien life, including aliens right here on Earth.  With infectious enthusiasm, Bill Nye shows that evolution is much more than a rebuttal to creationism; it is an essential way to understand how nature works--and to change the world. It might also help you get a date on a Saturday night.""   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Strangely enough, his moment of enlightenment came behind the bars of San Quentin's death row. In this compelling memoir, inmate and author Jarvis Jay Masters takes us from the arms of his heroin-addicted mother to an abusive foster home, on his escape to the illusory freedom of the streets and through lonely nights spent in bus stations and juvenile homes, and finally to life inside the walls of San Quentin State Prison. Using the nub and filler from a ballpoint pen (the only writing instrument allowed him in solitary confinement), Masters chronicles the story of a bright boy who turns to a life of crime, and of a penitent man who embraces Buddhism to find hope in this ultimately inspirational story.Masters has written his remarkable story as a cautionary tale for anyone who might be tempted to follow in his footsteps, and as a plea for under-standing to a world that too often ignores the plight of the forgotten members of society. His personal story dramatically reminds us all that freedom and opportunity are not to be taken for granted, and that no matter what their neighborhood, no matter what their race, every child matters.

The response comes from a religious community that has not been very visible: Asian Americans. The author employs the threefold epistemological scaffold familiar to Asian Americans: (1) translocal value orientation embedded in the experiences of racialization, (2) a heightened sensitivity to pathos arising out of our dissonance with the societal norms and values, and (3) amphibolous spirituality, that is, a co-existence of multiple religious traditions without any resolution of their differences. The angle of vision embedded in this epistemological framework of Asian Americans' lives may well provide a clue to an alternate architectural paradigm in building a new peoplehood and to redefine democratic freedom as the historical paradigm of American peoplehood""--Back cover.

Talese/Doubleday|Language English|Pages 378,"For generations, a fabled mansion in Jerusalem has been the retreat for foreign correspondents, diplomats, pilgrims, and spies, but, until now, no one had known the true story of the house that became the American Colony Hotel, with its bizarre history of tragedy, religious- extremism, emotional blackmail, and peculiar sexual practices.In America's heartland, during the boom years following the Civil War, Horatio Spafford, a prominent Chicago lawyer, and his blue-eyed wife, Anna, rode the mighty tide of Protestant evangelicalism deluging the nation. In the wake of a sudden personal tragedy, the charismatic Spaffords convinced their followers that the Second Coming was at hand, and in 1881 they sailed with them to Jerusalem to see the Messiah alight on the Mount of Olives.No sooner had they settled into the Holy City than the American Consul and the established Christian missionaries declared them heretics and whispered of sexual deviance. Yet both Muslims and Jews admired their unflagging care of the sick and the needy, and Jews were intrigued by their advocacy of a Jewish return to Zion. When Horatio died, Anna assumed leadership, shocking even her adherents by abolishing marriage, and established a dictatorship that was not always benevolent. Ever dogged by controversy, she and her credulous followers lived through and closely participated in the titanic upheavals that eventually formed the modern Middle East. Written with flair and insight, American Priestess provides a fascinating exploration of the seductive power of evangelicalism and raises questions about the manipulation of religion to serve personal goals. A powerful narrative, the story sweeps through the dramatic collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the establishment of the British Mandate, and finally the founding of Israel, where the American Colony Hotel, Anna's house in East Jerusalem, stands as an exemplar of beauty and comfort, a favorite of heads of state and others fortunate enough to afford it.

Ronald Reagan: In God I Trust shows what the news media do not report regarding the President's spiritual convictions. Examine for yourself his actual statements on faith, prayer, family, the sanctity of life, Judeo-Christian values, and America's spiritual heritage. After reading this book, you will better understand Ronald Reagan and the impact of his statements on the nation and the world.

Grandmother, convinced of the legitimacy of Joseph Smith, discloses to an inquisitive teen the betrayal and deceit she has uncovered in a forty-year quest for the truth. What unfolds is a complex drama that transformed Joseph Smith's focus on the eternal into a gospel fixated on the flesh. A transformation paved on a trail of blood that would necessitate the eventual murdering of Joseph Smith and other family members at the hands of the Danite's disguised as a mob. A trail that would climax thousands of miles away in a desert where the leader of this deceit, Brigham Young, would bring the United States Government down upon the church by ordering the slaughter of a wealthy wagon train. -- Amazon.

Following the authors, we read the Bible with new eyes: as a critic of gender, ideology, politics and culture. We ask ourselves new questions: about God's body, about women's role, about racial prejudices and about the politics of the written word.Reading Bibles, Writing Bodies crosses boundaries. It questions our most fundamental assumptions about the Bible. It shows how biblical studies can benefit from the mainstream of Western intellectual discourse, throwing up entirely new questions and offering surprising answers.

On this shared ground we listen as leading pastoral theologians of six centuries gather around the text of Scripture and offer their best theological, spiritual and pastoral insights. With the aid of computer technology, the vast array of writings from the church fathers-- including much that is available only in the ancient languages-- have been searched for their comment on Scripture, then hand-selected by scholars who then shaped and annotated the materials to introduce it to today's readers. Each portion of commentary has been chosen for its salient insight, its rhetorical power and its faithful representation of the consensual exegesis of the early church.--Book jacket and publisher's website.

Yet people continue to find him one of the most joyful and hopeful people they have encountered. In Made for Goodness, Tutu shares his source of strength and optimism. Written with his daughter, Mpho, who is also an ordained Anglican minister, Tutu argues that God has made us for goodness, and when we simply start walking in the direction of this calling, God is there to meet us, encourage us, embrace us. God has made the world as a grand theater for us to work out this call to goodness; it is up to us to live up to this calling, but God is there to help us every step of the way. So tackling our worst problems takes on new meaning and is bostered with hope and the expectation that that is exactly where God will show up. Father and daughter offer an inspiring message of hope that will transform readers into activists for change and blessing""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The essays here, by seasoned scholars of Jeremiah, offer significant traction on the biblical book's construction of the persona of Jeremiah and the subjectivity of Judah as subaltern; analysis of gendered imagery for the speaking subject in Jeremiah and for the Judean social body; exploration of rhetorics of imperialism and resistance; and theological implications of feminist-critical perspectives on YHWH and other deities represented in Jeremiah. Essays here deftly synthesize historical, literary, and ideological-critical insights in service of nuanced inquiry into Jeremiah as complex cultural production. The collection represents the growing edge of recent critical thinking on Jeremiah in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. It should prove invaluable in shaping the parameters of the continuing scholarly conversation on the Book of Jeremiah.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Un percorso tra i miti di fondazione, i sacerdozi, la dimensione cultuale pubblica e quella privata, i rituali maschili e quelli femminili, attraverso i quali la cultura romana ha costruito la propria identità religiosa plurale e non esclusiva. Un lavoro che esorta ad avere a cuore non solo la tutela del patrimonio storico e artistico della romanità che noi italiani (che moltissimi 'beni culturali' abbiamo a disposizione) consideriamo spesso con atteggiamento distratto, ma soprattutto la memoria culturale che esso implica.

He was persecuted by the Catholics for his Calvinist beliefs. He was seen as a heretic by his co-religionists because of the doubt that was an essential part of his view of life. He became an icon for many of the Enlightenment?s most prominent figures because of his inveterate defence of religious tolerance. He is widely unknown in today?s Denmark. You could call him a figure of Christian Enlightenment, a tolerant warrior, born in a time of war, where Catholic France carried through a bloody showdown with its Protestant population. He was an exceptionally gifted thinker who spoke on behalf of toleration, thus becoming an emblematic figure for Enlightenment thinkers as Montesquieu and Voltaire.  Religious fanaticism was Bayle?s primary enemy; the contending parties should be brought to an awareness of their lack of tolerance. His life and battles seems like a prelude to the Enlightenment. Because of this Bayle and his writings are important elements in a still on-going battle: the battle between fanaticism and tolerance.

This volume, which includes contributions by several scholars and friends of Archbishop Fitzgerald, focuses on three aspects: the theology of religions, the experience of dialogue and Muslim-Christian relations. Written by specialists, either in English or in French, these seventeen contributions help to understand the challenge of dialogue as it has been emphasised by the Second Vatican Council.

We name our cities, hospitals, and churches after them. We flock to shrines bearing their remains. We ask for their help when we lose our keys. Who are these saints, what made them so holy, and what in the world are those birds doing on St. Francis's shoulder?  Jason Boyett's Pocket Guide to Sainthood takes an intriguing and unflinching look at the fascinating--and fascinatingly weird--lives of the saints. Whether you are a Catholic desperately needing a patron, or a Protestant trying to identify your cabbie's bobblehead, this may be as close as you ever come to true holiness.

Langston's salvation,Wallace D.

Known for his poetry, plays, and social activism, the importance of religion in Hughes' work has historically been ignored or dismissed. This book puts this aspect of Hughes work front and center, placing it into the wider context of twentieth-century American and African American religious cultures. Best brings to life the religious orientation of Hughes work, illuminating how this powerful figure helped to expand the definition of African American religion during this time. Best argues that contrary to popular perception, Hughes was neither an avowed atheist nor unconcerned with religious matters. He demonstrates that Hughes' religious writing helps to situate him and other black writers as important participants in a broader national discussion about race and religion in America. Through a rigorous analysis that includes attention to Hughes's unpublished religious poems, Langston's Salvation reveals new insights into Hughes's body of work, and demonstrates that while Hughes is seen as one of the most important voices of the Harlem Renaissance, his writing also needs to be understood within the context of twentieth-century American religious liberalism and of the larger modernist movement. Combining historical and literary analyses with biographical explorations of Langston Hughes as a writer and individual, Langston's Salvation opens a space to read Langston Hughes' writing religiously, in order to fully understand the writer and the world he inhabited.

Richard Holloway retells the entire history of religionfrom the dawn of religious belief to the twenty-first centurywith deepest respect and a keen commitment to accuracy. Writing for those with faith and those without, and especially for young readers, he encourages curiosity and tolerance, accentuates nuance and mystery, and calmly restores a sense of the value of faith.  Ranging far beyond the major world religions of Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, Holloway also examines where religious belief comes from, the search for meaning throughout history, todays fascinations with Scientology and creationism, religiously motivated violence, hostilities between religious people and secularists, and more. Holloway proves an empathic yet discerning guide to the enduring significance of faith and its power from ancient times to our own.--INSIDE FLAP.

The first five chapters offer a new historical synthesis, bringing together evidence from Christian authors and biblical manuscripts from earliest times to the late Middle Ages. Each witness is considered in its chronological and geographical context, to build up the bigger picture of the transmission of the text. There are chapters introducing features of Latin biblical manuscripts and examining how the Latin tradition may serve as a witness for the Greek New Testament. In addition, each book of the New Testament is considered in turn, with details of the principal witnesses and features of particular textual interest. The three main scholarly editions of the Latin New Testament (the Vetus Latina edition, the Stuttgart Vulgate, and the Oxford Vulgate) are described in detail. Information is also given about other editions and resources, enabling researchers to understand the significance of different approaches and become aware of the latest developments. The Catalogue of Manuscripts gives full details of each manuscript used in the major editions, with bibliographical references and links to sets of digital images. The Appendices include concordances for the different ways in which manuscripts are cited in scholarly literature. An extensive reference bibliography of publications on the Latin New Testament is also supplied.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The level of noise about the Arab world has been steadily rising. In the pastfifteen years outsiders have twice sent armies to war in the Middle East-to liberate Kuwait from Saddam and then to overthrow him in Iraq. Chronic strife has also afflicted Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and, by extension, Syria. Palestinians and Israelis have seen long periods of violence. The disaster of 9/11 has precipitated ""The War on Terror"" and scarcely an Arab country since has been free of terrorist attacks or the tension of retaliatory operations against terrorist groups.  Futurologists forecast that by 2025 the European Union will need up to a hundred and ten million new migrant workers, if European populations are to maintain today's proportions of workers to pensioners. Many of these migrants are expected to come to Europe from Arab countries. Yet a rising level of general migration, a sub-trend of globalization, has already made immigration a hot issuein elections in European countries.  Among the consequences of all of this has been an appalling amount of ignorance, prejudice and hatred of Arab people everywhere. Sir Mark Allen's Who is an Arab?is a passionate and highly informed attempt at an antidote. The book looks at what defines the Arab as a person, the influences and conditions which tell us what the Arab is like and, perhaps, why. The book is more concerned with the people themselves than with history, battles and dates. Also, entering into the spirit of the conviction that we can easily miss the personal dimension, the author shares much of how his own experience shapes his point of view. His knowledge of the Middle East and Arab world today is matchless   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Theodicy of Peter Taylor Forsyth,Theng Huat Leow,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16529258W,/authors/OL7086235A/Theng_Huat_Leow,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32924327M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Pickwick Publications|Language English|Pages 268,"The theodicy of the remarkable Scottish Congregationalist theologian Peter Taylor Forsyth has long been recognized as a vital and significant contribution to twentieth-century theology. Up until now, however, there has not been a substantial full-length treatment of Forsyth's work on the problem of evil. The Theodicy of Peter Taylor Forsyth fills this lacuna by setting out, in a fairly systematic and comprehensive manner, Forsyth's justification of God in the face of evil. In so doing, it also illuminates several other related areas of his thought, such as his epistemology and Christology, as well as his understanding of sin, the atonement, providence, divine passibility, human origins, and the God-world relationship. Bringing Forsyth's approach to the subject into conversation with other prominent thinkers like Leibniz, Dostoyevsky, Camus, Moltmann, Hick, Bauckham, and Fiddes, this book also suggests ways in which Forsyth's justification of God contributes to the current state of Christian theodicy. It highlights Forsyth's ability to integrate insights from different approaches, even those that have hitherto generally been considered diametrically opposed notions. Forsyth's theodicy therefore presents an integrative approach to the topic, with every theme flowing from and returning to a clear center: the cross of Christ. As the book also makes clear, Forsyth considers theodicy to be an immensely practical discipline, with significant implications for human life. In every sense, therefore, it constitutes a ""crucial"" justification of the ways of God to humanity.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This volume provides balanced and judicious treatments of the various facets of these topics from a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural perspective. It provides nuanced examinations of ancient ritual, exploring the various meanings that human sacrifice held for antiquity, and examines its varied repercussions up into the modern world. The book explores evidence to shed new light on the origins of the rite, to whom these sacrifices were offered, and by whom they were performed. It presents fresh insights into the social and religious meanings of this practice in its varied biblical landscape and ancient contexts, and demonstrates how human sacrifice has captured the imagination of later writers who have employed it in diverse cultural and theological discourses to convey their own views and ideologies. It provides valuable perspectives for understanding key cultural, theological and ideological dimensions, such as the sacrifice of Christ, scapegoating,self-sacrifice and martyrdom in post-biblical and modern times""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is an invitation to God's kingdom, where tears are replaced by laughter and longing hearts find their purpose and their home. This is the heart of the gospel: God's search to reclaim us and love us as his own. But have we truly grasped this?  Those of us who have disdained Christianity as a religion of bigotry---have we repudiated the genuine article or merely demonstrated our own prejudice and ignorance?  Those of us who are Christians---have we deeply apprehended the mission of Jesus, and do our ways and character faithfully reflect his beauty? From the nature of God, to the human condition, to the work of Jesus, to God's coming kingdom, and all that lies between, how well do we understand the foundational truths of Christianity and their implications?  The Faith is a book for our troubled times and for decades to come, for Christians and non-Christians alike. It is the most important book Chuck Colson and Harold Fickett have ever written: a thought-provoking, soul-searching, and powerful manifesto of the great, historical central truths of Christianity that have sustained believers through the centuries. Brought to immediacy with vivid, true stories, here is what Christianity is really about and why it is a religion of hope, redemption, and beauty.

We can write a check to feed starving children or hold signs in the streets and feel like we've made a difference without ever encountering the faces of the suffering masses. In this book, Shane Claiborne describes an authentic faith rooted in belief, action, and love, inviting us into a movement of the Spirit that begins inside each of us and extends into a broken world. Shane's faith led him to dress the wounds of lepers with Mother Teresa, visit families in Iraq amidst bombings, and dump $10,000 in coins and bills on Wall Street to redistribute wealth. Shane lives out this revolution each day in his local neighborhood, an impoverished community in North Philadelphia, by living among the homeless, helping local kids with homework, and 'practicing resurrection' in the forgotten places of our world.  Shane's message will comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable . . . but will also invite us into an irresistible revolution. His is a vision for ordinary radicals ready to change the world with little acts of love.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|5 Have read

David Peat went to a Blackfoot Sun Dance ceremony. Having spent all of his life steeped in and influenced by linear Western science, he was entranced by the Native American worldview and, through dialogue circles between scientists and native elders, he began to explore it in greater depth. Blackfoot Physics is the account of his discoveries. In an edifying synthesis of anthropology, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and quantum theory, Peat compares the medicines, the myths, the languages--the entire perceptions of reality of the Western and indigenous peoples. What becomes apparent is the amazing resemblance between indigenous teachings and some of the insights that are emerging from modern science, a congruence that is as enlightening about the physical universe as it is about the circular evolution of humanity's understanding. Through Peat's insightful observations, he extends our understanding of ourselves, our understanding of the universe, and how the two intersect in a meaningful vision of human life in relation to a greater reality.

Emotions ran high, reflecting the nation's extreme polarization over abortion. Yet the divisions did not fall neatly along partisan or religious lines-the assembled protesters were far from a bunch of fire-breathing culture warriors. In Defenders of the Unborn, Daniel K. Williams reveals the hidden history of the pro-life movement in America, showing that a cause that many see as reactionary and anti-feminist began as a liberal crusade for human rights. For decades, the media portrayed the pro-life movement as a Catholic cause, but by the time of the Central Park rally, that stereotype was already hopelessly outdated. The kinds of people in attendance at pro-life rallies ranged from white Protestant physicians, to young mothers, to African American Democratic legislators-even the occasional member of Planned Parenthood. One of New York City's most vocal pro-life advocates was a liberal Lutheran minister who was best known for his civil rights activism and his protests against the Vietnam War. The language with which pro-lifers championed their cause was not that of conservative Catholic theology, infused with attacks on contraception and women's sexual freedom. Rather, they saw themselves as civil rights crusaders, defending the inalienable right to life of a defenseless minority: the unborn fetus. It was because of this grounding in human rights, Williams argues, that the right-to-life movement gained such momentum in the early 1960s. Indeed, pro-lifers were winning the battle before Roe v. Wade changed the course of history. Through a deep investigation of previously untapped archives, Williams presents the untold story of New Deal-era liberals who forged alliances with a diverse array of activists, Republican and Democrat alike, to fight for what they saw as a human rights cause. Provocative and insightful, Defenders of the Unborn is a must-read for anyone who craves a deeper understanding of a highly-charged issue""--Provided by publisher.  ""Abortion is the most divisive issue in America's culture wars, seemingly creating a clear division between conservative members of the Religious Right and people who align themselves with socially and politically liberal causes. In Defenders of the Unborn, historian Daniel K. Williams complicates the history of abortion debates in the United States by offering a detailed, engagingly written narrative of the pro-life movement's mid-twentieth-century origins. He explains that the movement began long before Roe v. Wade, and traces its fifty-year history to explain how and why abortion politics have continued to polarize the nation up to the present day""--Provided by publisher.

'Abd al-Wahhab, often considered to be Islam's Martin Luther, shaped the political and religious identity of the Saudi state while also enabling the significant worldwide expansion of Salafist Islam. Studies of the movement he inspired, however, have often been limited by scholars' insufficient access to key sources within Saudi Arabia. Nabil Mouline was granted rare interviews and admittance to important Saudi archives in preparation for this groundbreaking book, the first in-depth study of the Wahhabi religious movement from its founding to the modern day. Gleaning information from both written and oral sources and employing a multidisciplinary approach that combines history, sociology, and Islamic studies, Mouline presents a new reading of this movement that transcends the usual resort to polemics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now, in God's Almost Chosen Peoples, Lincoln Prize-winning historian George C. Rable offers a groundbreaking account of how Americans of all political and religious persuasions used faith to interpret the course of the war. Examining a wide range of published and unpublished documents--including sermons, official statements from various churches, denominational papers and periodicals, and letters, diaries, and newspaper articles--Rable illuminates the broad role of religion during the Civil War, giving attention to often-neglected groups such as Mormons, Catholics, blacks, and people from the Trans-Mississippi region. The book underscores religion's presence in the everyday lives of Americans north and south struggling to understand the meaning of the conflict, from the tragedy of individual death to victory and defeat in battle and even the ultimate outcome of the war. Rable shows that themes of providence, sin, and judgment pervaded both public and private writings about the conflict. Perhaps most important, this volume--the only comprehensive religious history of the war--highlights the resilience of religious faith in the face of political and military storms the likes of which Americans had never before endured. - Publisher.

Carroll Pickett, who spent fifteen years as the death house chaplain at ""The Walls,"" the Huntsville unit of the Texas prison system. In that capacity Reverend Pickett ministered to ninety-five men before they were put to death by lethal injection. They came with sinister nicknames like ""The Candy Man"" and ""The Good Samaritan Killer,"" some contrite, some angry - a few who might have even been innocent. All of them found in Reverend Pickett their last chance for an unbiased confessor who would look at them only as fellow humans, not simply as the convicted criminals the rest of society had already dismissed them as. This firsthand experience gave Reverend Pickett the unique insight needed to write an impassioned statement on the realities of capital punishment in America.  The result is a thought-provoking and compelling book that takes the reader inside the criminal mind, inside the execution chamber, and inside the heart of a remarkable man who shares his thoughts and observations not only about capital punishment, but about the dark world of prison society.""--Jacket.

It was described by one reviewer as a masterpiece. In that book, the author reflected on the Islamic injunction, incumbent on every Muslim, to forbid wrongdoing. The present book is a short, accessible survey of the same material. Using anecdotes and stories from Islamic sources to illustrate the argument, Cook unravels the complexities of the subject. Moving  backwards and forwards through time, he demonstrates how the past informs the present. By the end, the reader will be familiar with a colourful array of characters from Islamic history ranging from the celebrated thinker Ghazzali, to the caliph Harun al-Rashid, to the Ayatollah Khumayni. The book educates and entertains - at its heart, however, is an important message about the Islamic tradition, its values, and the relevance of those values today.

K. Chesterton as a prophetic figure whose thought was to be classed with that Burke, Butler, Coleridge, and John Henry Newman. When Chesterton died in 1936, T. S. Eliot pronounced that 'Chesterton's social and economic ideas were the ideas for his time that were fundamentally Christian and Catholic'. But how did he come by these ideas? Eliot noted that Chesterton attached 'significance also to his development, to his beginnings as well as to his ends, and to the movement from one to the other'. It is on that development that this book is focused.  Chesterton and the Romance of Orthodoxy is an exploration of G.K. Chesterton's imaginative and spiritual development, from his early childhood in the 1870s to his intellectual maturity in the first decade of the twentieth century. William Oddie draws extensively on Chesterton's unpublished letters and notebooks, his journalism, and his early classic writings, to reveal the writer in his own words. In the first major study of Chesterton to draw on this source material, Oddie charts the progression of Chesterton's ideas from his first story (composed at the age of three and dictated to his aunt Rose) to his apologetic masterpiece Orthodoxy, in which he openly established the intellectual foundations on which the prolific writing of his last three decades would build.  Part One explores the years of Chesterton's obscurity; his childhood, his adolescence, his years as a student and a young adult. Part Two examines Chesterton's emergence on to the public stage, his success as one of the leading journalists of his day, and his growing renown as a man of letters. Written to engage all with an interest in Chesterton's life and times, Oddie's accessible style ably conveys the warmth and subtlety of thought that delighted the first readership of the enigmatic GKC.

Was this all life was—a hodgepodge of errands, dinner dates, e-mails, meetings, to-do lists? What did it all mean?Having grown up in a deeply religious and traditional family, Shapiro had no personal sense of faith, despite repeated attempts to create a connection to something greater. Feeling as if she was plunging headlong into what Carl Jung termed ""the afternoon of life,"" she wrestled with self-doubt and a searing disquietude that would awaken her in the middle of the night. Set adrift by loss—her father's early death; the life-threatening illness of her infant son; her troubled relationship with her mother—she had become edgy and uncertain. At the heart of this anxiety, she realized, was a challenge: What did she believe? Spurred on by the big questions her young son began to raise, Shapiro embarked upon a surprisingly joyful quest to find meaning in a constantly changing world. The result is Devotion: a literary excavation to the core of a life.In this spiritual detective story, Shapiro explores the varieties of experience she has pursued—from the rituals of her black hat Orthodox Jewish relatives to yoga shalas and meditation retreats. A reckoning of the choices she has made and the knowledge she has gained, Devotion is the story of a woman whose search for meaning ultimately leads her home. Her journey is at once poignant and funny, intensely personal—and completely universal.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Faith Unraveled, Rachel recounts growing up in a culture obsessed with apologetics, struggling as her own faith unraveled one unexpected question at a time.  In order for her faith to survive, Rachel realizes, it must adapt to change and evolve. Using as an illustration her own spiritual journey from certainty to doubt to faith, Evans challenges you to disentangle your faith from false fundamentals and to trust in a God who is big enough to handle your tough questions.  In a changing cultural environment where new ideas seem to threaten the safety and security of the faith, Faith Unraveled is a fearlessly honest story of survival.

One of the most striking features of Mexican religious life is the prevalence of images of the Virgin Mother of God. This is partly because the divine feminine played such a prominent role in pre-Hispanic Mexican religion. Goddess images were central to the devotional life of the Aztecs, especially peasants and those living in villages outside the central city of Tenochtitlan (present day Mexico City). In these rural communities fertility and fecundity, more than war rituals and sacrificial tribute, were the main focus of cultic activity. Both Aztec goddesses and the Christian Madonnas who replaced them were associated, and sometimes identified, with nature and the environment: the earth, water, trees and other sources of creativity and vitality. This book uncovers the myths and images of 22 Aztec Goddesses and 28 Christian Madonnas of Mexico. Their rich and symbolic meaning is revealed by placing them in the context of the religious worldviews in which they appear and by situating them within the devotional life of the faithful for whom they function as powerful mediators of divine grace and terror""--Publisher.

It answers the questions “Why am I here?” and “What is the nature of the universe?”  The book discusses, in a clear and easily understandable way: the main principles of Buddhism, modern physics, time, space, and thought.  All of these concepts come together in the end to explain the Buddhist term, enlightenment.  While the book attempts to describe enlightenment, it does so with the realization that it is taking on an impossible task.  Enlightenment is something which can not be described.  Once you try to describe it or think about it, it is gone.  Enlightenment is something which can only be experienced.  But, sometimes, reading and thinking about enlightenment can trick your mind out of its linear and logical stance.  It is my hope that this book will help that happen for you.

They affect the interactions of entire nations and individuals, though their history is often understood as one of conflict and controversy. The present volume documents past encounters and confrontations, though it also shows that the history of the three faiths is not merely one of conflict but also one of co-existence and dialogue. The rich shared theological traditions of the Abrahamic religions provide positive encouragement to present-day meetings between their followers. The book contains 16 contributions by scholars from various fields of religious studies. It should appeal to everyone interested in interreligious encounters.

Each chapter presents field research and critical reflection on what constitutes modern Buddhism in one of nine countries or regions. Histories of Buddhism are common; this is the only source for in-depth information on modern Buddhism.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In a gesture typical of the syncretic tendency in Esotericism, Yoga is by these Westerners often identified as an Eastern form of magic: the two disciplines were considered to share similar theoretical perspective, the difference in their methods notwithstanding. India and the Occult explores the reception of Indian spirituality among Western occultists through several case studies. Unlike existing works focusing on the activities of Theosophical Society, it looks at the 'hard-core' occultism, in particular the British twentieth century currents associated with Aleister Crowley, Dion Fortune, Kenneth Grant, and related individuals and groups. Without denying the specificity of its Western historical manifestation, it suggests that esotericism is a category that may be applied as a conceptual tool in order to interpret aspects of non-Western religious thought and practice""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Brill|Language English|Pages 409,"The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina, ancient Praeneste in central Italy, dating to about 100BC, is one of the earliest large mosaics which have been preserved from the classical world. Interpretation of the mosaic is disputed, suggestions ranging from the exotic decoration to a topographical picture or a religious allegory. This study argues that the mosaic depicts rituals connected with Isis and Osiris and the yearly Nile flood. The presence of these Egyptian religious scenes at Praeneste can be explained by the assimilation of Isis and Fortuna, the tutelary goddess of Praeneste, and by the interpretation of the mosaic as a symbol of divine providence. This book should be of interest to classical archaeologists, art historians, Egyptologists, classical philologists, ancient historians and students of ancient religion.

Williams offers a sweeping overview of the role religion has played in Georgia's history, from precolonial days to the modern era. Williams shows that colonial Georgia was a remarkably diverse place, populated by mainline colonial congregations that included Anglicans, Roman Catholics, German- and Spanish-speaking Jews, Salzburg Lutherans, and Scottish Presbyterians. It wasn't until much later that evangelicalism triumphed and Baptists became the overwhelmingly dominant denomination. Williams uses the stories of such important figures as Tomochichi, John Wesley, Jesse Mercer, Henry McNeal Turner, Lillian Smith, Martin Luther King Jr., and Clarence Jordan to portray larger historical narratives and denominational battles. Race and religion were intertwined not only in such key movements as abolition and civil rights but also throughout Georgia's history. ""In order to fully grasp the religious heritage of Georgia,"" Williams says, ""we must return again and again to racial matters."" Recently, Georgians have seen racial, ethnic, and religious diversity grow as Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Baha'i, and other communities have settled in the state. Williams explores how Georgians have dealt with contemporary issues of tolerance and how, at times, the state has taken center stage in our nation's culture wars. Firmly rooting religious history in a social, cultural, and political context, Williams presents a representative and balanced account of Georgia's religious heritage. From Mounds to Megachurches sheds new light on what it means to be a Georgian by exploring an issue that remains central to life in the Sunbelt South. - Publisher.

Sie alle widmen sich der Frage, ob es in Religion und Theologie Entwicklung geben kann - eine Debatte, die sich von der Antike über das Mittelalter bis in die Neuzeit verfolgen lässt: Kann etwa im Verhältnis von griechisch-römischen Kulten, Judentum, Christentum und Islam von 'alten' und 'neuen' Religionen gesprochen werden? Wie werden in ihnen jeweils die Begriffe 'alt' und 'neu', 'Fortschritt' und 'Modernität' geltend gemacht? Diese lang tradierten Fragen gewinnen in der Gegenwart eine dringliche Aktualität, etwa bei der Suche nach Antworten auf die vieldiskutierte 'Glaubenskrise' der christlichen Kirchen oder bei der Forderung nach einem 'modernen' Islam.""

American covenant,Philip S. Gorski,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL20052722W,/authors/OL3249468A/Philip_S._Gorski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 320,"Was the United States founded as a Christian nation or a secular democracy? Neither, argues Philip Gorski in American Covenant. What the founders actually envisioned was a prophetic republic that would weave together the ethical vision of the Hebrew prophets and the Western political heritage of civic republicanism. In this ambitious book, Gorski shows why this civil religious tradition is now in peril--and with it the American experiment.  Gorski traces the historical development of prophetic republicanism from the Puritan era to the present day. He provides close readings of thinkers such as John Winthrop, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Hannah Arendt, along with insightful portraits of recent and contemporary religious and political leaders such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Gorski shows how the founders' original vision for America is threatened by an internecine struggle between two rival traditions, religious nationalism and radical secularism. Religious nationalism is a form of militaristic hyperpatriotism that imagines the United States as a divine instrument in the final showdown between good and evil. Radical secularists fervently deny the positive contributions of the Judeo-Christian tradition to the American project and seek to remove all traces of religious expression from the public square. Gorski offers an unsparing critique of both, demonstrating how half a century of culture war has drowned out the quieter voices of the vital center.  American Covenant makes the compelling case that if we are to rebuild that vital center, we must recover the civil religious tradition on which the republic was founded.--AMAZON.

Captivated, he investigated further and learned that from 1590 to 1890, this cross between a prayer book and a farmer's almanac was immensely popular in households all across Europe. Published in dozens of editions and revised over the centuries in Venice, Prague, Amsterdam, and throughout Germany before moving eastward in the nineteenth century to Poland and Russia, these books detail the evolution of Jewish custom over three hundred years. But by the 1890s, as Jewish practice became polarized between the secularist and traditionalist views, the Minhogimbukh disappeared.There are no works quite like the historical customs books available today and none so thorough and concise, intuitive in organization, and beautiful. Inspired by the originals, Kosofsky set out to make his own, adapting the books for modern use, adding historical perspective and contemporary application. The result is the reappearance of the Minhogimbukh after more than a hundred-year absence, and the first complete showing of all the original woodcuts -- a visual vocabulary of Jewish life -- since the 1760s. Faithfully based on the earlier editions, The Book of Customs is an updated guide to the rituals, liturgies, and texts of the entire Jewish year -- from the days of the week and the Sabbath to all the months with their festivals, as well as the major life-cycle events of wedding, birth, bar and bat mitzvah, and death. With the revival of this lost cultural legacy, The Book of Customs can once again become every family's guide to Jewish tradition and practice.

When all else fails, Buddhism becomes their last resort: providing them with physical shelter and spiritual refuge. It heals their childhood traumas and gives them a moral framework for living and a better outlook on life. Each individual story, heartrending as it may be, subtly shows what Phra Peter sees and hopes to show to others: the 'human face' of Thai Buddhism.

In the searching of our souls demanded by this challenge . . . kindred spirits across the nation must confront the most fundamental liberal failure of the current era: the failure to embrace a moral vision of America based on the transcendent faith that human beings are more than the sum of their material appetites, our country is more than an economic machine, and freedom is not license but responsibility--the gift we have received and the legacy we must bequeath. ""Although our sojourn in life is brief, we are on a great journey. For those who came before us and for those who follow, our moral, political, and religious duty to make sure that this nation, which was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all are equal under the law, is in good hands on our watch."" --from ""For America's Sake""People know Bill Moyers mostly from his many years of path-breaking journalism on television. But he is also one of America's most sought-after public speakers. His appearances draw sell-out crowds across the country and are among the most reproduced on the Web. ""And one reason,"" writes noted journalist Bill McKibben, ""is that Moyers pulls no punches. His understanding of America's history is at least as deep as his understanding of Christian tradition, which is an integral part of his background . . . With his feet firmly planted in the deepest American traditions, Bill Moyers is helping to keep alive an oratorical tradition that is fading after two centuries. Trained by his career in broadcasting, he writes for the ear, his cadences and his repetitions timed to bring an audience to full realization of its role and its power."" And that is the message of this book. Moyers on Democracy collects many of Bill Moyers's most moving statements to connect the dots on what is happening to our country--the twinned growth of private wealth and public squalor, the assault on our Constitution, the undermining of the electoral process, the accelerating class war against ordinary (and vulnerable) Americans inherent in the growth of economic inequality, the dangers of an imperial executive, the attack on the independence of the press, the despoiling of the earth we share as our common gift--and to rekindle the reader's conviction that ""the gravediggers of democracy will not have the last word."" Richly insightful and alive with a fierce, abiding love for our country, Moyers on Democracy is essential reading in this fateful presidential year.

Drawing on unprecedented access to unexplored archives, plus Francis's own letters, Spoto places Francis within the context of the multifaceted ecclesiastical, political, and social forces of medieval Italy, casting new light on Francis and showing how his emphasis on charity as the heart of the Gospel's message helped him pioneer a new social movement.

The Other Jesus explores these varied traditions and offers a fresh exploration of Jesus - new perspectives that challenge long-accepted beliefs about his place in history and his impact on other religions.-- INSIDE COVER.

During the years 2008 and 2009, a time of intense drug violence, Sarah Luna met and built relationships with two kinds of migrants, women who moved from rural Mexico to Reynosa to become sex workers and American missionaries who moved from the United States to forge a fellowship with those workers.  Luna examines the entanglements, both intimate and financial, that define their lives. Using the concept of obligar, she delves into the connections that tie sex workers to their families, their clients, their pimps, the missionaries, and the drug dealers—and to the guilt, power, and comfort of faith. Love in the Drug War scrutinizes not only la zona and the people who work to survive there, but also Reynosa itself—including the influences of the United States—adding nuance and new understanding to the current Mexico-US border crisis.

I enjoyed reading it. The comparisons of those days of Noah and the present times are compared in the after words. Vey interesting read.

Surprisingly, though, the Bible does not have one answer but many ""answers"" that often contradict one another. Consider these competing explanations for suffering put forth by various biblical writers: The prophets: suffering is a punishment for sinThe book of Job, which offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; and suffering is beyond comprehension, since we are just human beings and God, after all, is GodEcclesiastes: suffering is the nature of things, so just accept itAll apocalyptic texts in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament: God will eventually make right all that is wrong with the worldFor renowned Bible scholar Bart Ehrman, the question of why there is so much suffering in the world is more than a haunting thought. Ehrman's inability to reconcile the claims of faith with the facts of real life led the former pastor of the Princeton Baptist Church to reject Christianity.In God's Problem, Ehrman discusses his personal anguish upon discovering the Bible's contradictory explanations for suffering and invites all people of faith—or no faith—to confront their deepest questions about how God engages the world and each of us.

"The line through the heart: natural law as fact, theory, and sign of contradiction",J.

Yet it is something else as well -- a sign of contradiction, something that exasperates, offends, and enrages. The transient cause of such rage is the suicidal proclivity of our time to deny the obvious, but a more enduring cause is the Fall of Man. Our hearts are riddled with desires that oppose their deepest longings, and we demand to have happiness on terms that make happiness impossible. In The Line Through the Heart, popular philosopher J. Budziszewski threads a path between these various abysses. Among his questions are how the knowledge of good is related to the knowledge of God, how things that seem to run against the grain of human nature can become ""second nature"", and whether natural law can be reconciled with Darwinian evolution. Turning to politics, he takes up such topics as who counts as a human person, whether human dignity is compatible with capital punishment, what courts have made of the United States Constitution, and how an ersatz state religion can be built in the name of Toleration. Written in Budziszewski's usual crystalline style, The Line Through the Heart makes the natural law and its implications clear for both scholars and general readers. - Publisher.

Recipient of the prestigious High Prize of the Society of French Poets and Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor, Bies introduces the contemporary reader to the treasury of metaphysical, esoteric and spiritual teaching from diverse sacred sources and his writings never fail to blend meaning and beauty. His words are rooted in the inexhaustible ground of the Perennial Philosophy: the language of the Essential to which this book invites, inspiringly, to return.Having received the prestigious High Prize of the Society of Poets, Jean Bies is known in France as one of the most important traditionalist philosophers and poets of our time. His more than twenty books, from which these selected writings are taken, present the metaphysical and esoteric teachings of the great religions of the world; they include travel writings and intimate portraits of sacred sites such as Mount Athos and Benares, and multiple collections of poetry. Previously unknown to the English speaking world, Jean Bies must be counted as one of the premier twentieth century exponents of the Perennial Philosophy.

Hemmed in by implacable enemies on three sides, and by ocean on the fourth, it seemed that the Christian people had nowhere to turn. Indeed, there were many who feared--cast in the Millennium's shadow--that they were nearing the time when the Antichrist would appear, drowning the world in blood and heralding its end. But the Antichrist did not appear, and Christendom did not collapse. Instead, forged from the convulsions of those terrible times, there emerged a new civilization as the Christian people set to the heroic task of building a Jerusalem on earth themselves. With an epic sweep that transports us from the crucifixion to the First Crusade, and from the glitter of Constantinople to the bleak shores of Canada, Tom Holland's The Forge of Christendom is a brilliant study of a truly fateful revolution: the emergence of Western Europe for the first time as a distinctive and expansionist power.It was the age of Otto the Great and William the Conqueror, of Caliphs and Viking sea-kings, of hermits, monks, and serfs. It witnessed the spread of castles, the invention of knighthood, and the founding of a papal monarchy. Above all, it brought people to fear that the end days might be at hand, and yet also--with an effort so prodigious that it has the power to move us still--to invent themselves anew.A momentous achievement: for this was nothing less than the founding of the modern West. It is an epic story that Tom Holland renders with the narrative skill and wide-angled scope of a novelist and the careful scholarship a historian. It will transform its readers' conception of the origins of the Modern West.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Albert Einstein, Isaac Asimov, E.M. Forster, Bertrand Russell, and Gloria Steinem all declared themselves humanists. What is humanism and why does it matter? Is there any doctrine every humanist must hold? If it rejects religion, what does it offer in its place? Have the twentieth century's crimes against humanity spelled the end for humanism?On Humanism is a timely and powerfully argued philosophical defence of humanism. It is also an impassioned plea that we turn to ourselves, not religion, if we want to answer Socrates' age-old question: what is the best kind of life to lead? Although humanism has much in common with science, Richard Norman shows that it is far from a denial of the more mysterious, fragile side of being human. He deals with big questions such as the environment, Darwinism and 'creation science', euthanasia and abortion, and then argues that it is ultimately through the human capacity for art, literature and the imagination that humanism is a powerful alternative to religious belief.Drawing on a varied range of examples from Aristotle to Primo Levi and the novels of Virginia Woolf and Graham Swift, On Humanism is a lucid and much needed reflection on this much talked about but little understood phenomenon.

Whether you speak from the pulpit, podium, or the front of a classroom, you don't need much more than blank stares and faraway looks to tell you you're not connecting. Take heart before your audience takes leave! You can convey your message in the powerful, life-changing way it deserves to be told. An insightful, entertaining parable that's an excellent guide for any speaker, Communicating for a Change takes a simple approach to delivering effectively. Join Pastor Ray as he discovers that the secrets to successful speaking are parallel to the lessons a trucker learns on the road. By knowing your destination before you leave (identifying the one basic premise of your message), using your blinkers (making transitions obvious), and implementing five other practical points, you'll drive your message home every time! ""Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""  ""Once upon a time...""  ""In the beginning...""  Great stories capture and hold an audience's attention from start to finish. Why should it be any different when you stand up to speak?  In Communicating for a Change, Andy Stanley and Lane Jones offer a unique strategy for communicators seeking to deliver captivating and practical messages. In this highly creative presentation, the authors unpack seven concepts that will empower you to engage and impact your audience in a way that leaves them wanting more.  ""Whether you are a senior pastor with weekly teaching responsibilities or a student pastor who has bern charged with engaging the hearts and minds of high school students, this book is a must-read.""  Bill Hybels  Senior pastor, Willow Creak Community Church  ""A very practical resource for every biblical communicator who wants to go from good to great.""  Ed Young  Senior pastor, Fellowship Church, Grapevine, Texas  ""To communicate effectively, you have to connect. Andy has been connecting with people for years, and now he's sharing his insights with the rest of us.""  Jeff Foxworthy Comedian  INSIDE LEFT FLAP  In Communicating for a Change, Andy Stanley shares the seven imperatives that define his approach to challenging people's minds in order to change their lives:   Determine Your Goal Pick a Point Create a Map Internalize the Message Engage Your Audience Find Your Voice Start All Over  These seven concepts will simplify your approach to communication and transform your sermons, lessons, and presentations into powerful life-changing experiences for your listeners.  Story Behind the BookAndy Stanley and Lane Jones are on staff at one of America 's largest churches, North Point Community. Leaders of thousands of people, they regularly speak in front of large groups. They also listen to numerous speakers and know the disastrous effects of a poorly delivered message. This book is the result of their efforts to make public speaking--one of the most common fear-inducing activities known to mankind--simple, easy, and even enjoyable, so that God's messages will readily produce the life-changing results they should.From the Hardcover edition.

The series begun by The Fullness of God : Frithjof Schuon on Christianity (World Wisdom, 2004) continues, with a collection of Schuon’s chapters on the deep seated human need for prayer — our primary way of communing with the Divine. The book is edited by James Cutsinger, who also edited Paths to the Heart: Sufism and the Christian East (World Wisdom, 2002) and Not of This World: A Treasury of Christian Mysticism (World Wisdom, 2003). Frithjof Schuon was widely acknowledged by many scholars of mysticism and comparative religion as the twentieth century’s foremost metaphysician and exponent of the Perennial Philosophy.  More than a scholar, however, he was above all a man of prayer, whose fundamental message was always linked to the importance of our consciousness of God.  This anthology selects chapters from Schuon’s published twenty-three books as well as previously unpublished writings; its content ranges across the enormous spectrum of his writings on prayer and spiritual life.  Presented in a fully revised English translation from the original French, this is a compelling portrait of one of the great Masters of our time.The volume concludes with a short appendix of previously unpublished material, including samples from Schuon’s correspondence with various seekers. Editor’s notes, a glossary of foreign terms, and a comprehensive index are also included to make this volume a very useful tool for students, as well as a rich mine for seekers after the sacred.

The myth of a Christian religion: losing your religion for the beauty of a revolution,Gregory A.

Marked by the radical life, love, servanthood, and humility of Jesus, it stands in stark contrast to the values and ways of the world.  Regrettably, many who profess to follow Christ have bought into the world's methods, seeking to impose a sort of Christianized ethical kingdom through politics and control. In this illuminating sequel to his bestselling book The Myth of a Christian Nation, Dr. Gregory Boyd points us to a better way---a way of seeing and living that is consistent with the gospel of Jesus and his kingdom. Between the extremes of passivity on the one hand and political holy war on the other lies the radical, revolutionary path of imitating Jesus.  In twelve areas ranging from racial and social issues to stewardship of the planet, this book will convince and inspire you to live a Christlike life of revolt and beauty---and it will help you attain a practical lifestyle of kingdom impact.

"Shinto, a short history",Mark Teeuwen,religion,First published in 2003,/works/OL666471W?edition=ia%3Ashintoshorthisto0000teeu,/authors/OL51812A/Mark_Teeuwen,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24274720M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Taylor & Francis Inc|Language English,"Shinto - A Short History provides an introductory outline of the historical development of Shinto from the ancient period of Japanese history until the present day. Shinto does not offer a readily identifiable set of teachings, rituals or beliefs; individual shrines and kami deities have led their own lives, not within the confines of a narrowly defined Shinto, but rather as participants in a religious field that included Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and folk elements. Thus, this book approaches Shinto as a series of historical 'religious systems' rather than attempting to identify a timeless 'Shinto essence'.This history focuses on three aspects of Shinto practice: the people involved in shrine worship, the institutional networks that ensured continuity, and teachings and rituals. By following the interplay between these aspects in different periods, a pattern of continuity and discontinuity is revealed that challenges received understandings of the history of Shinto.This book does not presuppose prior knowledge of Japanese religion, and is easily accessible for those new to the subject.

The author disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic morality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be possible within such narrow limits; but observe how well and faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India and the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great Asiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This compassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by the collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to employ; but many another lofty tenet of the ""Light"" of Asia finds illumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by; and he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple pages must become a better man at the year's end than at its beginning.

Liberalism's religion,Cécile Laborde,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL19728936W,/authors/OL6597343A/Cécile_Laborde,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 337,"Liberal societies conventionally treat religion as unique under the law, requiring both special protection (as in guarantees of free worship) and special containment (to keep religion and the state separate). But recently this idea that religion requires a legal exception has come under fire from those who argue that religion is no different from any other conception of the good, and the state should treat all such conceptions according to principles of neutrality and equal liberty. Cécile Laborde agrees with much of this liberal egalitarian critique, but she argues that a simple analogy between the good and religion misrepresents the complex relationships among religion, law, and the state. Religion serves as more than a statement of belief about what is true, or a code of moral and ethical conduct. It also refers to comprehensive ways of life, political theories of justice, modes of voluntary association, and vulnerable collective identities. Disaggregating religion into its various dimensions, as Laborde does, has two clear advantages. First, it shows greater respect for ethical and social pluralism by ensuring that whatever treatment religion receives from the law, it receives because of features that it shares with nonreligious beliefs, conceptions, and identities. Second, it dispenses with the Western, Christian-inflected conception of religion that liberal political theory relies on, especially in dealing with the issue of separation between religion and state. As a result, Liberalism's Religion offers a novel answer to the question: Can Western theories of secularism and religion be applied more universally in non-Western societies?--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Døden i livet,Aud Johannessen,religion,First published in 2018,/works/OL20929852W,/authors/OL8011543A/Aud_Johannessen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Cappelen Damm Akademisk/NOASP (Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing)|Pages 233,"""There is a widely held notion that death is not particularly visible in our culture; death is something we do not talk about. The premise for Døden i livet has been to challenge this preconception from a variety of perspectives and disciplines.  The authors argue that death is present in our lives in many ways. We see it and experience it in our physical surroundings, for example in the various arrangements we make to remind ourselves of the dead. We hear or read about it in speeches, poems, music lyrics, psalms, obituaries, biographies, picture books, novels and newspapers. We talk about death in conversations with each other, in characterizing the dead and in clinical language about illness and death. We reveal our understanding of death through visual forms such as newspaper images, illustrations in books and in the imagery and metaphors we employ when we describe it.  Døden i livet is a mult-disciplinary, scientific anthology consisting of 12 peer-reviewed chapters geared towards scholars and students interested in broader appreciation of how death is present in our culture. The chapters are written by researchers working in such diverse fields as health, pedagogics, idea history, religion, literature studies, linguistics and rhetoric.""  ""Det er en utbredt oppfatning at døden er lite synlig i vår kultur og at vi snakker lite om den. Utgangspunktet for antologien Døden i livet er å utfordre disse forestillingene fra ulike perspektiv og fagfelt.  Forfatterne understreker at døden er til stede i våre liv på mange måter. Vi ser den og opplever den i våre fysiske omgivelser, for eksempel der hvor vi har innrettet oss for å minnes de døde. Vi hører den eller leser om den i taler, dikt, musikalske tekster, salmer, nekrologer, biografier, bildebøker, romaner og avistekster. Vi uttaler oss om død i samtaler med hverandre, i karakteristikker av avdøde og gjennom fagspråk om sykdom og død. Vi viser vår forståelse av døden gjennom visuelle uttrykk som i avisbilder, i bokillustrasjoner og i de språklige bildene og metaforene vi bruker når vi omtaler den.  Døden i livet er en tverrfaglig, vitenskapelig antologi. Boken består av 12 fagfellevurderte kapitler og henvender seg til forskere og studenter som har interesse av å sette seg inn i hvordan døden er til stede i vår kultur. Kapitlene er skrevet av forskere fra ulike fagfelt som helsefag, pedagogikk, idéhistorie, religionsvitenskap, litteraturvitenskap, språkvitenskap og retorikk.""

Decades later, Rose would still visit the reverend and his wife, Ruth, warming their hearts with memories of Mother Graham, as she was known, and how every conversation would lead back to the Bible. In time, Adams put these recollections on tape for Billy Graham. Deeply touched, he then suggested putting them into book form, knowing so many would draw comfort and strength from seeing how one younger woman experienced the secret of learning from the older (Titus 2:3). 'Treasured Moments with Mother Graham' is the life-changing result, several months worth of daily devotions built from the diary of Rose Adams. These are indeed treasured moments that span every book of the Bible and every facet of the Christian life"" --Cover, p. 4.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Straightforward and easy to read, 55 Answers to Questions About Life After Death satisfies that nagging, curious voice whispering from the corner of your mind.  Story Behind the Book""Three key experiences in my life have come together to make this book a reality. First, as the pastor of a local church for thirteen years, I have had the privilege of visiting people who are facing imminent death, conducting funerals, and ministering to grieving families. During these times people often have probing questions about life after death. Second, due to my interest and writing in the area of Bible prophecy, I am frequently asked questions about the afterlife at conferences and via e-mail. Third, all kinds of books, TV shows, and groups out there today are fostering unbiblical views of life after death. Knowing that this is a subject of universal interest and great confusion, I have a passionate desire to create a user-friendly, clear, straightforward resource to answer all the key questions that people everywhere are asking about life's greatest mystery.""From the Trade Paperback edition.

"Maudu', A Union with God",Muhammad Adlin Sila,religion,First published in 2015,/works/OL20932507W,/authors/OL8012503A/Muhammad_Adlin_Sila,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  ANU Press,"This volume offers a fascinating case study of the Sayyid community of Cikoang in South Sulawesi – in particular, an examination of the role of the descendants of Sayyid Jalaluddin al-‘Aidid, a Hadhrami merchant-teacher of great authority and charisma who is said to have initially settled in Gowa in the 17th century. It is of particular interest because the migration of Sayydid Jalaluddin occurred well before the major Hadhrami diaspora to Southeast Asia in the mid-19th century. Of particular interest is the way Sayyid Jalaluddin and his descendants became integrated within the Makassar community. Sayyid Jalaluddin’s legacy to the Cikoang community is the Tarekat Bahr ul-Nur, whose mystic teachings expound the creation of the world from the ‘Nur Muhammad’. A consequence of this teaching is an enormous emphasis on the celebration of Maudu’ (Maulid or the Birth of the Prophet) as expressed in the local assertion: ‘My existence on this earth is for nothing but Maudu’.’ Every year this prompts the Cikoang community to hold one of the most elaborate and colourful Maulid celebrations in Indonesia.  This study was originally submitted as an MA thesis at ANU in 1998, but soon became recognised as an important contribution to Hadhrami studies. Its author, M. Adlin Sila, has since gone on to complete his PhD at ANU, Being Muslim in Bima of Sumbawa, Indonesia: Practice, Politics and Cultural Diversity. This study of Bima and its religious history establishes him as a major researcher on the diverse traditions of Islam in eastern Indonesia.

These were interwoven so as to lead all the way from villages and local parishes to the Roman Curia, and from widower’s households and local municipal offices to the Imperial Court Chancellery in Vienna. The focus on how kinship was administrated opens up an approach to processes by which the state and the church, as well as the state and the regions, were integrated during an era that, in this respect, would prove to be historically decisive.  Diese Studie untersucht das Phänomen der Verwandtenheirat in den vielfältigen diskursiv-konzeptuellen, rechtlich-politischen, administrativ-bürokratischen, familien- und haushaltsorganisatori-schen, soziokulturellen und soziopolitischen Kontexten. In Ver-flechtungen führen diese vom Dorf und vom örtlichen Pfarrhaus bis in die römische Kurie, vom Witwerhaushalt und vom lokalen Gemeindeamt bis in die Wiener Hofkanzlei. Der auf das Verwalten von Verwandtschaft gelegte Fokus eröffnet einen Zugang zu Prozessen der Integration von Staat und Kirche sowie von Staat und Region in einer in diesem Zusammenhang historisch ent-scheidenden Ära.

He is well known for his commitment to protecting the environment, and for opening communications with other Christians as well as with Muslims and other religious groups. His efforts for raising environmental awareness globally have earned him the title ""Green Patriarch.""Written with personal warmth and great erudition, Encountering the Mystery illuminates the rich culture and soul of Orthodox Christianity. Bartholomew traces the roots of Orthodox Christianity to its founding two thousand years ago, explores its spirituality and doctrine, and explains its liturgy and art. More especially, in a unique and unprecedented way, he relates Orthodox Christianity to contemporary issues, such as freedom and human rights, social justice and globalization, as well as nationalism and war.With a recent rebirth of Orthodox Christian churches (particularly in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe), there has been great interest in understanding this important branch of Christianity with its close ties to the traditions of the early Church. As USA Today recently reported, Orthodox Christian churches throughout the country are drawing converts attracted by the beauty of its liturgy and inspired by its enduring theology. But for the general seeker, whatever their background, Encountering the Mystery is a rich spiritual source that draws upon the wisdom of millennia.

Antifundamentalism in Modern America,David Harrington Watt,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL17782157W,/authors/OL889272A/David_Harrington_Watt,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26371658M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Cornell University Press|Language English,"David Harrington Watt's Antifundamentalism in Modern America gives us a pathbreaking account of the role that the fear of fundamentalism has played -- and continues to play -- in American culture. Fundamentalism has never been a neutral category of analysis, and Watt scrutinizes the various political purposes that the concept has been made to serve. In 1920, the conservative Baptist writer Curtis Lee Laws coined the word ""fundamentalists."" Watt examines the antifundamentalist polemics of Harry Emerson Fosdick, Talcott Parsons, Stanley Kramer, and Richard Hofstadter, which convinced many Americans that religious fundamentalists were almost by definition backward, intolerant, and anti-intellectual and that fundamentalism was a dangerous form of religion that had no legitimate place in the modern world. For almost fifty years, the concept of fundamentalism was linked almost exclusively to Protestant Christians. The overthrow of the Shah of Iran and the establishment of an Islamic republic led to a more elastic understanding of the nature of fundamentalism. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Americans became accustomed to using fundamentalism as a way of talking about Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists, as well as Christians. Many Americans came to see Protestant fundamentalism as an expression of a larger phenomenon that was wreaking havoc all over the world. Antifundamentalism in Modern America is the first book to provide an overview of the way that the fear of fundamentalism has shaped U.S. culture, and it will lead readers to rethink their understanding of what fundamentalism is and what it does. - Publisher.

How would God vote?,David Klinghoffer,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL1912091W,/authors/OL229049A/David_Klinghoffer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24250168M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Doubleday|Language English|Pages 260,"From How Would God Vote?""The Bible commands a style of politics that in the American context could only be described as deeply conservative. Is, then, the politics of God theocratic?""A strong case could be made for theocracy, American-style, if the word were defined not in the conventional way but according to its root meaning. Democracy signifies the rule of the demos, the people. Strictly speaking, theocracy means the rule not of churches or priests but of theos, God. It won't do to deny that many conservatives, even while unambiguously affirming the traditional American separation of church and state, would add more theos to the democratic mix than is currently the case. I choose not to call myself a theocrat because I know how eager liberal secularists would be to twist the word against me. Dishonestly they would make it appear that I wish to impose a literal biblical theocracy, that I would dumbly imitate word for word the political structure of king, priesthood, and religious high court that existed in biblical antiquity.""Yet, in a subtler sense, are we not all theocrats now?""This startlingly original investigation into the controversies dividing America provides a clear and convincing affirmation of the relevance of the Bible to contemporary politics.With liberals and conservatives alike claiming the authority of the Bible as support for their views on social and moral issues, the need to understand what the Bible actually says has never been more pressing. In How Would God Vote?, journalist and scholar David Klinghoffer illuminates the worldview set forth in the Scriptures and argues that, with some exceptions, the God of the Bible would overwhelmingly support traditionally conservative principles and policies.Klinghoffer considers the ethical and moral heart of contemporary political debates--questions like immigration, gay marriage, abortion, care for the poor, war and peace, censorship, privacy, the place of religion in schools and the community, and much more. There is a pattern here. It's for a very good reason that conservatives line up as they do, predictably, on a range of issue; as do liberals. The two competing political philosophies derive from radically different ways of looking at the world: one in consonance with the Bible, the other very much not.Klinghoffer, however, is no stereotypical Republican. Controversially, he argues that the Bible would have us emphasize domestic policy, the classic pre-9/11 culture war issues, over a hyped-up ""World War IV"" against ""Islamofascism."" The Bible has a foreign policy, he shows, and it is not neoconservative. He demonstrates support in the Scriptures for a welcoming attitude toward immigrants, for gun control, and for affirmative action.The Bible, Klinghoffer shows, is no mere list of dos and don'ts but a fully coherent and practically relevant portrait of moral reality, compelling and deep enough to guide not only our private but our public lives. Even if we as individuals fail its private tests, that's no reason to reject its public lessons.To anyone who takes God seriously, every election poses a radical question: Will we vote with Him, or against Him? The Bible is an unapologetically political book, Klinghoffer explains, and an extremely conservative one. Some political views offend God, and those views are mostly liberal. In short, the Bible commands you to be a conservative.Stimulating and provocative, How Would God Vote? is an important contribution to pre-election debates and to setting the path the nation will follow in the future under a new president.

Was he the result of still ongoing natural processes or a unique creation? Observations seem to validate at least some aspects of evolutionary theory, but long before Darwin, a man named David discerned that there's more to humanity than nature alone can account for. Ten years ago, in the first edition of Who Was Adam?, biochemist Fazale Rana and astronomer Hugh Ross proposed a ground-breaking new approach to probe questions about human origins. This approach, which they have called the ""testable creation model,"" advanced the radical idea that the traditional biblical view of Adam and Eve has scientific credibility. The first half of this updated edition has left the original manuscript intact. The second half then reflects on how the model has fared in light of a decade of scientific developments. Where did RTB's testable creation model for human origins meet its predictions? Where does the model need to be adjusted? Get your copy of Who Was Adam? to find out. - Publisher.

Anterior a los Evangelios canónicos, fue utilizado por los evangelistas Mateo y Lucas para redactar sus obras. En este libro, César Vidal ha reconstruido el texto del Documento Q traduciéndolo por primera vez al castellano y dando con ello la posibilidad de conocer la realidad histórica de Jesús. Junto con el texto del Documento Q, esta obra nos presenta el relato de la historia judía durante la época de Jesús y los apóstoles; la descripción de sus principales movimientos (el Templo, el Sanhedrín, la Sinagoga) y su relación con Jesús; el retrato de la sociedad de la época y, muy especialmente, un análisis riguroso y científico acerca de lo que este Evangelio nos revela sobre Jesús y sus enseñanzas. Completan la obra dos apéndices dedicados a la fecha de redacción de los Evangelios y a las posibilidades de conocer históricamente la vida real de Jesús.
