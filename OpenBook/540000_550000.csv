Russia seems to be flexing its military muscle and looking to regain the great power status it had when it was the largest country inside the Soviet Union (USSR, 1922-1991). In 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into neighboring Georgia (also once a part of the Soviet Union) in response to a conflict over to small regions with strong ties to Russia. The international community was outraged, but did little. In 2014, the Crimea Peninsula, part of Ukraine, became the focus of the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War (1945-1990). After Ukraine's president was driven from power, pro-Russian forces seized Crimea. They then voted in an election, declared illegal by Ukraine, to make Crimea part of Russia. In eastern Ukraine pro-Russian rebels aided by Russian military equipment, and supported by Russia, have been fighting the Ukrainian Army to establish an independent territory. This has sent shivers all over Eastern Europe, especially among countries that used to be, like Russia, part of the Soviet Union. - p. 5.

But what this treasure consists of is an ancient mystery that is known only to the Elders of Een—and it is a secret they guard well.  When the box is suddenly stolen, panic spreads across the land of Een and the wizard Griffinskitch is chosen to lead a band of would-be heroes into the wilds of the outside world to go in search of the fabled chest. One of the chosen Eens is Griffinskitch’s eleven-year-old niece, Kendra Kandlestar, a curious girl who craves adventure and excitement—and the truth about her long-lost family.  Soon, Kendra finds herself swept away on a journey where doors speak in riddles, plants cast treacherous spells, and strange creatures seem to lurk in every shadow. Will Kendra be able to overcome these perils and face the mysterious thief who lords over the Box of Whispers?

It’s common knowledge that the Loney family has been barely hanging on, but when the Loney children’s father George dies in a drunken stupor and their stepmother takes off with a traveling Bible salesman, it looks as though the children are done for. Who’s to save them when everyone is coping with their own problems — the lingering Depression and the loss of the town’s young men to the Second World War? Under the watchful eye of their ghostly parents and through the small kindnesses of a few neighbors, but mostly by dint of their own determination and ingenuity, the Loney children survive. I'll Be Watching is an extremely powerful story of children at risk because of adult hypocrisy, indifference, self-interest, and outright immorality, all cloaked in a self-righteous exterior.

His hometown is one of the great Jewish centers of Europe -- until the German forces arrive at the outbreak of World War II and begin targeting the Jewish community. Jaap's instincts are to protect his Jewish friends and neighbors from Nazi persecution, and he sets to work making fake ID cards for them. As the war progresses and the Nazis turn his beloved Amsterdam into a death trap for Jews, Jaap realizes he must take a more drastic action. The scheme he devises requires two things for it to succeed: outsmarting the Nazis at their own game and having nerves of steel. The hardest part for him is not just risking his own life, but deciding which other lives he dares to risk, if he is to save them. Hudson Talbott gives us a dramatic account of a man who knew he must act against these dark forces. As Jaap has said, "" You do these things because in your mind there is no other way of doing it."" - Jacket flap.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Only the truly desperate make them. Only the truly desperate need them. And always, the desperate pay.  The silence and never-ending dark of winter are all Elice has ever known, for she is the daughter of the Winter Queen. Isolated in a northern queendom with only the seals for company, she dreams of color and music and life. So when a whaling ship crashes just offshore, she doesn't hesitate to rescue the lone survivor, Adar, who quickly becomes her friend. She must keep him hidden from her mother at all costs, for if the Winter Queen discovers him trespassing, she'll kill him.  When her mother reveals just how dark her soul has become, Elice realizes she is as much a prisoner as Adar. To ever know true freedom—to ever become the woman she was meant to be—she must flee with him. But in their flight, she begins to see hints of something more nefarious. The darkness that has taken hold of her mother is spreading, staining the world with its influence.  Unbeknownst to Elice, a bargain was made long ago. A bargain she was born to fulfill.

They were the happiest people on the planet.  True, they were the only people on the planet, but they were still terrifically happy.  Unfortunately, things didn’t stay happy and wonderful for long . . .  The Bible is full of exciting stories that fill children with awe and wonder. But kids need to know how all those classic stories connect to Scripture’s overarching message about God’s glorious plan to redeem his rebellious people.  In The Biggest Story, Kevin DeYoung—a best-selling author and father of six—leads kids and parents alike on an exciting journey through the Bible, connecting the dots from the garden of Eden to Christ's death on the cross to the new heaven and new earth.    With powerful illustrations by award-winning artist Don Clark, this imaginative retelling of the Bible’s core message—how the Snake Crusher brings us back to the garden—will draw children into the biblical story, teaching them that God's promises are even bigger and better than we think.

McElderry Books|Language English|Pages 26","Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known by his followers as Mahatma -- or great soul -- was born in India in 1869 and grew up to become one of the most influential and well-respected political and social leaders the world has ever known.    An adamant idealist and a courageous thinker, Gandhi identified himself with the struggles of the common people. He became the sole voice of the downtrodden and the exploited and believed fervently in the notion that ""hatred can only be overcome by love."" He vowed to instigate social and political change through nonviolent means and succeeded in changing India's prejudicial caste system and winning India's independence from British rule.    Gandhi's teachings inspired Martin Luther King's nonviolent civil rights movement in the United States and Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Gandhi's philosophies of nonviolence and peaceful protest continue to inspire people around the world.    In beautiful language and exquisite illustrations inspired by Gandhi's own belief in the simplicity and truth of life, Demi captures the spirit that was Mahatma Gandhi and pays homage to this great man.

Every single incident related here really happened. Judy is my youngest daughter and the letters she wrote home from France during her year's study there were so entertaining and filled with adventures, I thought teen-agers everywhere might enjoy them. And so, together, we have adapted them into a book. The story is entirely from Judy's viewpoint; in a great many parts it is in her own words.

But some events are so profound, they not only change the course of history, they also manage to leave a legacy so powerful, it can be called world-changing. This book looks at 10 of these events - from the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus which brought about a radical change to the face of those continents, to the attacks of 9/11, which ushered in a new era of warfare and terrorism. Each of the 10 world-changing events is examined in detail - what were the circumstances; who was involved and why; what kind of a legacy has it left; and how is it still relevant to us today? Spanning a significant portion of human history, from the age of discovery in the 15th century, to both World Wars, the birth of modern science and the end of Apartheid, this book not only examines the events themselves, but also places them in the context of other historical events and developments. Perfect for course work and cross-curricular activities spanning history, politics and science; the book includes 10 further momentous events, as well as a timeline that places them in the context of world history.

Each volume in the series tells the action-packed yet scientifically accurate story of a different dinosaur living in its particular geological time and place. At the back of each volume are several short essays, abundantly illustrated with original drawings and photographs of fossils, that explain more about the creatures and geographical settings encountered in the comic. These essays, written in terms that kids will understand, reveal not only what paleontologists have learned about the age of the dinosaurs, but also how they have learned it, by examining fossils and other types of evidence.  T. Rex and the Great Extinction, the sixth and last title in the series, takes us back 65 million years, to the late Cretaceous period, when the age of the dinosaurs was drawing to its close. In this world, whose scenery resembles that of our own, we accompany a great Tyrannosaurus as it patrols its territory. Usually it hunts a hadrosaur known as Edmontosaurus, but today it comes upon a venerable Triceratops with a broken horn, and the most epic clash in animal history takes place. The essays following the comic shed light on the mystery of the dinosaurs' extinction.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They both require logic, critical thinking skills, and creativity! In Video Games: Design and Code Your Own Adventure, readers discover that the video games they play today have their roots in the games kids played in the deserts of Ancient Egypt, and they'll learn how to design their own games from the initial idea to the final blips on the screen. Video games are everywhere, from iPods and tablets to video consoles and the latest virtual reality headset. By diving into this familiar, engaging topic, kids will get the chance to explore the neuroscience behind the attraction of video games: what makes them fun, what makes them hard to put down. They'll even tackle the age-old question--are video games good for us or bad for us? Readers will deconstruct video games to learn why the characters behave the way they do and how real-world physics compares to game physics. As kids design their own games, they'll develop skills in storytelling, technical writing, communications, graphic design, computer programming, and teamwork. They'll have so much fun they won't realize they're learning about geometry, statistics, probability, physics, logic, psychology, and neuroscience. Activities in Video Games include creating text-based adventure quests, designing board games, and programming using free, kid-friendly software such as MIT's Scratch. For kids who just can't get enough of video games, here's a chance to visit behind the scenes at a game company to explore the entire design process, from idea to market. Video Games meets Common Core State Standards for reading nonfiction and math. Guided Reading Levels and Lexile measurements indicate grade level and text complexity.

The bravest left their homes and set out into the unknown. But how did they find their way? How did they travel? How did they survive harsh weather, hunger, and other terrible dangers? Starting in 340 BC with Pytheas the Greek, who sailed to the Arctic Circle without so much as a compass, and ending in 1969 when the crew of Apollo 11 landed on the moon, author Stewart Ross and artist Stephen Biesty take readers on an adventure to learn more about these brave explorers. Using vivid storytelling and dynamic unfolding cutaways and cross sections, Into the Unknown creates an experience for readers that is as exciting as exploration itself. - Jacket flap.
