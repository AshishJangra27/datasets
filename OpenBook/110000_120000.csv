The results of extensive studies on the various interfacial and surface electronic characteristics, interfacial photoreactions and materials aspects of the layered semiconductors reported in the last fifteen years have been reviewed. The layered transition metal dichalcogenides have served as model compounds for the investigation of the details of photoelectrochemical processes and related studies involving surfaces. The layered semiconducting materials have been found to be promising solar cell materials. Significant energy conversion efficiencies have been realized in photoelectrochemical solar cells and in solid state photovoltaic cells. Novel studies including quantum size effects in layered semiconductors have been reported. UHV spectroscopic studies of the surfaces of important layered semiconductors have been given. Recent developments in the preparation of the layered materials have been summarized. New insights into the physical and chemical characteristics of this class of materials have been gained by the studies reported in this book. Highlights include: -- Data on optical and electronic properties of layered semiconductors; -- Solid state and semiconductor/electrolyte junction characteristics; -- Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical solar cells based on layered materials; -- UHV spectroscopic studies of surfaces of layered semiconductors; -- Quantum size effects in layered semiconductor colloids; -- Novel layered material preparation techniques.

Addressing this deficiency requires students to take additional mathematics training when entering university, yet the relevance of maths to chemistry is often poorly appreciated by chemistry students. In addition, many service courses are either too abstract, or aimed at physicists and engineers, for students of chemistry, who are not inclined to study mathematical techniques per se and do not make the connection between the maths they are taught and the chemistry they want to study. Based on the successful at a Glance approach, with integrated double page presentations explaining the mathematics required by undergraduate students of chemistry, set in context by detailed chemical examples, this book will be indispensable to all students of chemistry. By bringing the material together in this way the student is shown how to apply the maths and how it relates to familiar concepts in chemistry. By including problems (with answers) on each presentation, the student is encouraged to practice both the mathematical manipulations and the application to problems in chemistry. More detailed chemical problems at the end of each topic illustrate the range of chemistry to which the maths is relevant and help the student acquire sufficient confidence to apply it when necessary.

Chapters cover electrical and mechanical oscillating systems, as well as systems of coupled oscillators subjected to arbitrary driving forces. The book concludes with a short discussion of three-dimensional problems and a study of a few aspects of non-linear waves. Throughout Ingram Bloch focuses on laying a foundation for the study of quantum mechanics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Principles of Soft-Matter Dynamics. Basic Theories, Non-invasive Methods, Mesoscopic Aspects covers fundamental dynamic phenomena such as diffusion, relaxation, fluid dynamics, normal modes, order fluctuations, adsorption and wetting processes. It also elucidates the applications of the principles and of the methods referring to polymers, liquid crystals and other mesophases, membranes, amphiphilic systems, networks, and porous media including multiphase and multi-component materials, colloids, fine-particles, and emulsions. The book presents all formalisms, examines the basic concepts needed for applications of soft-matter science, and reviews non-invasive experimental techniques such as the multi-faceted realm of NMR methods, neutron and light quasi-elastic scattering, mechanical relaxation and dielectric broadband spectroscopy which are treated and compared on a common and consistent foundation. The standard concepts of dynamics in fluids, polymers, liquid crystals, colloids and adsorbates are comprehensively derived in a step-by-step manner. Principles and analogies common to diverse application fields are elucidated and theoretical and experimental aspects are supplemented by computational-physics considerations.Principles of Soft-Matter Dynamics. Basic Theories, Non-invasive Methods, Mesoscopic Aspects appeals to graduate and PhD students, post-docs, researchers, and industrial scientists alike.

Using specific examples, Living With Water will address the many challenges of providing clean water to the growing world population. It will also discuss the new technologies that are being developed, for example, to treat and reuse waste waters, and monitoring approaches that help scientists and stakeholders to assess water quality risks. Such risk assessments are urgently needed to help draft legislations and allow enforcement to ensure accessibility to quality water for all. The structure of the book will be the following: each chapter will provide information about a specific water environment  (headwaters, rivers, oceans) and the challenges it faces. This will be followed by discussion of the pollution effects and actions taken to redress the situation. Finally, future trends will be  discussed.

Each chapter builds upon the previous, using the same tools and methods throughout. As the students progress through the book, their ability to use these tools will steadily increase, along with their confidence in their efficacy. The book treats the two-electron atom as the simplest example of the many-electron atom—as opposed to using techniques that are not applicable to many-electron atoms—so that it is unnecessary to develop additional equations when turning to multielectron atoms, such as carbon. External fields are treated using both perturbation theory and direct diagonalization and spontaneous emission is developed from first principles. Only diatomic molecules are considered with the hydrogen molecular ion and neutral molecule treated in some detail. This comprehensive coverage of the quantum mechanics of complex atoms and simple diatomic molecules, developed from the very basic components, is extremely useful for students considering graduate studies in any area of physics.

In particular, the synthetic strategy of porous monolithic materials via the sol–gel method accompanied by phase separation, which is characterized as the non-templating method for tailoring well-defined macropores, is described from the basics to actual synthesis. Porous materials are attracting more and more attention in various fields such as electronics, energy storage, catalysis, sensing, adsorbents, biomedical science, and separation science. To date, many efforts have been made to synthesize porous materials in various chemical compositions—organics, inorganics including metals, glasses and ceramics, and organic-inorganic hybrids. Also demonstrated in this thesis are the potential applications of synthesized porous monolithic materials to separation media as well as to electrodes for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and Li-ion batteries (LIBs). This work is ideal for graduate students in materials science and is also useful to engineers or scientists seeking basic knowledge of porous monolithic materials.

In this extraordinarily extended dynamic range molecular and collective dipolar fluctuations, charge transport and polarisation effects at inner and outer boundaries take place and determine the dielectric properties of the material being studied. Hence, broadband dielectric spectroscopy enables one to gain a wealth of information on the dynamics of bound (dipoles) and mobile charge carriers depending on the details of a molecular system. It is the intention of this book to be both an introductory course to broadband dielectric spectroscopy as well as a monograph describing recent dielectric contributions to current topics. In this respect the book will correspond to the needs of graduate students but also to specialized researchers, molecular physicists, polymer scientists and materials scientists in academia and in industry.

Emphasis is laid on the layered or quasi-two-dimensional structure of these compounds, which provides an exciting arena for testing physical concepts in lower dimensions. The chapters in this volume, all of which have been written by internationally recognized experts in the field, cover the following topics: the structure and phase transitions of intercalate atoms and molecules in graphite, the physics of staging formation and staging transitions, the lattice dynamics of these compounds as determined by inelastic neutron scattering and optical methods, the diffusivity of the guest species, mesoscopic properties such as domain structures and stacking arrangements, and the synthesis of new compounds.

The first edition of this popular text focused on microbial systems and wastewater processes that are implemented in a treatment plant. While maintaining this approach, this revised edition also incorporates components that cover the fundamental aspects of inorganic and organic chemistry relating to water treatment and pollution.Microbiology and Chemistry for Environmental Scientists and Engineers provides the reader with an understanding of the complex biological and chemical issues involved in environmental science and engineering. A chapter on water quality includes the revised chemical and microbiological standards which will come into force under the new EC drinking water directive. Chemical aspects of water pollution emphasise some of the most dangerous chemical substances prevalent in the environment today.This book will be a valuable addition to the library of practising environmental engineers and scientists, and an essential text for undergraduate and postgraduate students taking courses in environmental, civil and public health engineering.

As a result, basic research on fullerenes has generated new knowledge as published in thousands of journal papers. The nuclear and radiation approaches, however, have been somewhat neglected in books dedicated to fullerene sciences, although these approaches have generated very interesting knowledge on the structure and composition of these new all-carbon molecules. This monograph intends to bridge this gap by dealing with the various aspects of nuclear sciences as applied to the generation of new knowledge in fullerene sciences. Ten chapters appear in this volume and were chosen to present a panoramic view and to provide theoretical perspectives, research methods, and experimental results on the topic. This book will serve both as an introduction to the subfield and as an aid to setting an agenda for scientists interested in this area of research. This is the first volume in a new series devoted to the developments in fullerene science.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An applications chapter covers three separate topics: medical image analysis, molecular modeling, and analysis of fluid flow. Audience: The book is intended primarily for computer vision and image processing scientists with a background in mathematics and scientific computation. However, ridges provide a general purpose tool for multidimensional data analysis, so the book will be of interest to practitioners in any field which requires the analyzing of data, such as statistics, the physical sciences, or engineering.

Solid Oxide Fuels Cells: Facts and Figures provides clear and accurate data for a selection of SOFC topics from the specific details of Ni cermet anodes, chemical expansion in materials, and the measuring and modelling of mechanical stresses, to the broader scope of the history and present design of cells, to SOFC systems and the future of SOFC. Celebrating Ulf Bossel’s work on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, and especially his running of the European Fuel Cell Forum, Solid Oxide Fuels Cells: Facts and Figures covers important topics on the way including intermediate temperature fuel cells, metal supported fuel cells and both new materials and engineering solutions to some of the challenges of getting SOFC to market.   The chapters are based on the special plenary talks given by some of the most respected and talented people in the field at the 2010 European SOFC Forum in Luzern and the title for this book comes from the report produced by Ulf for the IEA “Final Report on SOFC Data, Facts and Figures”, Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Berne, 1992.The comprehensive nature of Solid Oxide Fuels Cells: Facts and Figures makes it a key resource of SOFC topics for students, lecturers, researchers and industry practitioners alike.

Su estructura tiene en cuenta las dificultades de aprendizaje mencionadas, ya que el inicio de cada capítulo contempla el aspecto de la motivación mediante una ambientación cotidiana-agronómica que tiene a Pedro como protagonista, y en la que se plantea una inquietud. Luego el desarrollo formal de un conjunto clave de conceptos es el preludio para el cierre del capítulo, en el que la inquietud se ve resuelta, y el panorama se ve ampliado a concepciones específicas del ámbito agronómico. Luego, los ejercicios y problemas de final de capítulo, en su mayoría, también están adecuados al contexto académico futuro de Pedro. El desarrollo conceptual se nutre de explicaciones fundadas en imágenes que presentan los aspectos macroscópicos, y simpáticas ilustraciones y esquemas que facilitan el proceso de abstracción de los aspectos sub-microscópicos.

En base a la amplitud de los conceptos que comprende el dictado de la Química General y la carga horaria usualmente limitada de los cursos para carreras que no tienen a la Química como disciplina central, el desarrollo del presente libro, ha focalizado, de manera simple y objetiva, el tratamiento de los temas básicos de química, requeridos para el abordaje cuali y/o cuantitativo de aspectos vinculados a situaciones planteadas en sistemas naturales, en este caso biológicos y agrícolas, sentando las bases para acceder con solvencia al tratamiento de temas más avanzados de otras asignaturas de la carrera o bien de utilidad en el desarrollo de la práctica profesional.  Con una presentación accesible, clara, una excelente ilustración, el libro está escrito para facilitar el estudio, estimulando la observación y el interés de los alumnos, destacando en cada tema las aplicaciones más importantes en el área de la agricultura y en general del mundo que nos rodea.

It begins with a macroscopic formulation of the thermodynamic theory, within the framework of extended irreversible thermodynamics, and compares it with other non-equilibrium approaches. These macroscopic results are examined from a microscopic point of view for different systems, namely, ideal gases, non-ideal gases and dilute polymer solutions. The thermodynamic approach is applied to the analysis of shear-induced changes in the phase diagram of polymer solutions, to shear-induced diffusion and to chemical reactions under flow. It is also compared with the dynamical approach based on the detailed evolution equations. The book may be especially useful for researchers in non-equilibrium thermodynamics or non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and in polymer physics or materials sciences.

While new developments in theory are discussed to some extent, the major emphasis is on a comparison of calculated properties with experiment. This focus is similar to the one taken in a book, Comparison of Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry with Experiment for Small Molecules, edited by Rodney Bartlett (Reidel, 1984). However, the phenomenal improvement in both theoretical methods and computer architecture have made it possible to obtain accurate results for rather large molecular systems. This is perhaps best illustrated in this volume by the chapter entitled `Spectroscopy of Large Organic Molecules' by Bjorn Roos and coworkers. For example, the electronic spectra of the nucleic acid base monomer structures shown on the front cover have been obtained using a fully correlated ab initio study. For researchers, teachers and students in chemistry and physics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Beginning with the simple hydrogen atom, spectroscopic notation and angular momentum operators are discussed. This is followed by a general discussion of angular momentum theory including Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the Wigner-Eckart theorem, unit spherical tensors, and Racah coefficients. The extension of these techniques to the electronic configuration, nlN, for N equivalent electrons is discussed. The theory of point groups as applied to ions in solids is introduced, along with the use of the International Tables of Crystallography and character tables. The phenomenological theory of crystal fields is discussed in some detail along with the so-called free-ion parameters characterizing the Coulomb interaction, the spin-orbit interaction, and the interconfiguration interaction. The use of tables of 3-j and 6-j symbols used in the calculation of the matrix elements of the various interactions is presented, along with other tables and aids in the computation of the energy levels. The point ion model of crystal-field interaction is discussed with particular emphasis on recent work done on its development. The earlier work was applied to triply ionized rare-earth ions (4fN electronic configurations), and extensions of the point ion model are applied to the transition metal ions with the electronic configurations ndN (n=3, 4, and 5).

Instant color photography gives us an alternative way of realizing excellent color reproduction, in which dyes changing their diffusibility plays an important role. The aim of this book is to provide researchers and graduate students with a perspective on how such organic compounds work in color photography and how seemingly miraculous techniques based on organic chemistry lead to color images of high quality.

In spite of its simple definition—a path on a lattice that does not visit the same site more than once—it is difficult to analyze mathematically. The Self-Avoiding Walk provides the first unified account of the known rigorous results for the self-avoiding walk, with particular emphasis on its critical behavior. Its goals are to give an account of the current mathematical understanding of the model, to indicate some of the applications of the concept in physics and in chemistry, and to give an introduction to some of the nonrigorous methods used in those fields.   Topics covered in the book include: the lace expansion and its application to the self-avoiding walk in more than four dimensions where most issues are now resolved; an introduction to the nonrigorous scaling theory; classical work of Hammersley and others; a new exposition of Kesten’s pattern theorem and its consequences; a discussion of the decay of the two-point function and its relation to probabilistic renewal theory; analysis of Monte Carlo methods that have been used to study the self-avoiding walk; the role of the self-avoiding walk in physical and chemical applications. Methods from combinatorics, probability theory, analysis, and mathematical physics play important roles. The book is highly accessible to both professionals and graduate students in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.​   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Por eso nos hemos esforzado por ofrecer al sistema educativo un libro que transmita a los profesores y estudiantes un conocimiento concreto y actualizado.La obra presenta dos secciones que ayudan a complementar la formacion integral del estudiante: Literatura quimica,que plantea temas de interes,y Quimicos famosos,donde se destacan las actividades de algunos cientificos,quienes,por su actividades enpro del conocimiento universal,son modelos dignos de seguir. Al consultar y estudiar este libro,el profesor se familiarizara con los conceptos basicos de la quimica y con la forma de presentarlos en clase. La homologacion de terminos es importante,pues en un sistema de ensenanza eficaz no es conveniente que existan tantas definiciones como profesores.

The content of this edition is arranged so that all basic information is contained in the first part of the book, which is now rewritten and simplified in order to make it more accessible and used as a textbook for undergraduate students. More advanced topics, of interest for postgraduate levels, come in the subsequent parts.    This updated second edition focuses on experimental techniques, including a comprehensive chapter on physical methods for the investigation of electrode surfaces. New chapters deal with recent trends in electrochemistry, including nano- and micro-electrochemistry, solid-state electrochemistry, and electrocatalysis. In addition, the authors take into account the worldwide renewal of interest for the problem of fuel cells and include chapters on batteries, fuel cells, and double layer capacitors.

Applications extend beyond spectroscopy into important areas such as chemical dynamics, kinetics and atmospheric chemistry. This book provides the reader with a firm grounding of the basic principles and experimental techniques employed. The extensive use of case studies effectively illustrates how spectra are assigned and how information can be extracted, communicating the matter in a compelling and instructive manner. Topics covered include laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionisation, cavity ringdown and ZEKE spectroscopy. The book is for advanced undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in spectroscopy and will also be of use to anyone encountering electronic and/or photoelectron spectroscopy during their research.

This book is a must for materials scientists and engineers working with vacuum coating in the invention of new technologies or applications in all industries. With over 370 references, this is an excellent starting point for those who don’t want to reinvent the wheel. In particular, the book is a valuable reference for those interested in researching proposed or existing patents. This unique book provides a starting point for more in-depth surveys of past and recent work in all aspects of vacuum coating. The author uses his extensive knowledge of the subject to draw comparisons and place the information into the proper context. This is particularly important for the patent literature where the terminology does not always match industry jargon. A section of acronyms for vacuum coating and glossary of terms at the end of the book are critical additions to the information every reader needs.

Incomplete awareness presents just as big a problem; often people who have contact with such materials know just enough to feel safe while actually putting themselves and others in great danger. Though regulatory agencies have provided written standards, rarely do these on their own offer the commonsense advice needed to properly evaluate and handle hazardous materials.    Hazardous Materials Characterization: Evaluation Methods, Procedures, and Considerations provides detailed coverage of hazardous materials and situations. Plain language and a common- sense approach make this an accessible resource for use by all workers who handle and deal with these materials.    Written according to the latest regulations and best practices, this guide groups related materials together for quick and easy access (corrosive, ignitable, radioactive, etc.). It also details methods and procedures for evaluating the properties and strengths of questionable materials, as well as what reactive substances and situations to look out for when working with these materials.    Other topics covered include:   Regulatory review   Sampling and monitoring equipment, applications, and procedures   Human health hazards   Biological hazards   Radiation hazards   Evaluating chemical and biological terrorist threats   Environmental remediation methods   References and resources      Packed with the most up-to-date information on hazardous materials and written to maximize accessibility, Hazardous Materials Characterization is a vital reference for all those whose work involves hazardous materials.

But when there are multiple answers from various sources, how can we know what information is reliable? In ""Monkeys, Myths and Molecules,"" bestselling author Dr. Joe Schwarcz takes a critical look at how facts are misconstrued in the media. He debunks the myths surrounding canned food, artificial dyes, SPF, homeopathy, cancer, chemicals present in our lives, and much more. Unafraid to expose the sheer nonsense people are led to believe about health, food, drugs, and our environment, Dr. Joe confronts pseudoscience and, convincingly and entertainingly, advocates for a scientific approach to the everyday.

These subjects are developed at a level of mathematics suitable for graduate engineering study without the exhaustive level of the theoretical mathematical detail. The implementation of numerical methods in MATLAB is integrated within each chapter and numerous examples in chemical engineering are provided, with a library of corresponding MATLAB programs. This book will provide the graduate student with essential tools required by industry and research alike. Supplementary material includes solutions to homework problems set in the text, MATLAB programs and tutorial, lecture slides, and complicated derivations for the more advanced reader.

McEwen,Ray Quincy Brewster,chemistry,First published in 1964,/works/OL12565812W,/authors/OL5582872A/Ray_Quincy_Brewster,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25336148M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1964|Publisher  Prentice-Hall|Language English|Pages 854,"PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION    In preparing the revision of this textbook, we have rewritten and rearranged the material almost completely — in such a way that the properties of aliphatic and aromatic compounds are presented in an integrated manner. This unified treatment of the subject matter is advantageous in a course limited to one semester or two quarters, although a student may find the study of fundamental principles, as illustrated by the various classes of hydrocarbons, somewhat tedious before he begins consideration of other types of carbon compounds which, to him, are usually of greater significance. In order to gain the student's interest at the outset, the authors have devoted the first chapter to an introductory study of methyl and ethyl alcohols, whose simple transformations clearly reveal the important relationships existing among several prominent families of carbon compounds. Thereafter, the various classes of hydrocarbons and their derivatives are presented in logical order.    Throughout the book somewhat more stress has been laid upon mechanisms of reaction than is found in most texts designed for a short course. It is the authors' conviction that, even though but one semester or two quarters may be available for the study of organic chemistry, principles and theoretical topics should not be minimized to make room for a greater abundance of descriptive material. Both the observed facts and their interpretation are important. Hence, the electronic theory has been utilized throughout the text in the explanation of the properties of various classes of compounds. However, in order to avoid overwhelming the student at the start of the semester, the theoretical material is introduced in a gradual manner. For example, resonance and molecular orbital theory are introduced in simplified form in early chapters; the expansion and more rigorous treatment of these theoretical ideas are given later.    Illustrative material has been revised to include some of the newer processes and products. Many recent developments in biological and medicinal chemistry have been incorporated into appropriate chapters. Also, biographical and historical footnotes have been used to convey to the student some knowledge of the history of chemistry. At the conclusion of each chapter new questions and problems have been added to those appearing in the first edition. Answers to problems are given in the appendix.    The senior author welcomes as his collaborator in this revision of the textbook Professor William E. McEwen to whom credit is due for much of the newer material. Ray Q. Brewster William E. McEwen   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It satisfies the industrial demand for enhanced availability and safety, in contrast to traditional reactions to faults that bring about sudden shutdowns and loss of availability. The book presents effective model-based analysis and design methods for fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control. Architectural and structural models are used to analyse the propagation of the fault through the process, to test the fault detectability and to find the redundancies in the process that can be used to ensure fault tolerance. Design methods for diagnostic systems and fault-tolerant controllers are presented for processes that are described by analytical models, by discrete-event models or that can be dealt with as quantised systems. Four case studies on pilot processes show the applicability of the presented methods. The theoretical results are illustrated by two running examples which are used throughout the book.The book addresses engineering students, engineers in industry and researchers who wish to get a survey over the variety of approaches to process diagnosis and fault-tolerant control.

This has led to the launch of Conceptual Trends in Quantum Chemistry, a collection of essays intended to stimulate discussion in this field, of which the first volume was published in 1994, and the second in 1995. This third volume contains fourteen papers by leading experts, covering topics such as recent developments in multiple scattering theory and density functional theory for molecules and solids; localised atomic hybrids; quantum electrodynamics and molecular structure; aspects of the chemical bond; Lie symmetries in quantum mechanics; the interplay between quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations; the permutation group in many-electron theory; new developments in many body perturbation theory and coupled cluster theory; a philosopher's perspective of the `problem' of molecular shape; Van Der Waals interactions from density functional theories; different legacies and common aims; potential energy hypersurfaces for hydrogen bonded clusters (HF)N; one-electron pictures of electronic structure; and shape in quantum chemistry. Audience: This book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students whose work involves quantum chemistry, quantum mechanics, chemical physics, methodology, and mathematical statistical methods.

The fundamental quantum-mechanical and relativity principles of particle interaction are considered as basis of friction micro-process examination. The changes in solid structure originated from the influence of different kinds of force fields are considered. The principal possibility of relativity effect manifestation by friction is explained. The critical state of friction – triboplasma – was studied. Structural peculiarities of triboplasma, the kinetics of its transformation during frictional interaction as well as the influence of plasma and postplasma processes on tribojunction friction characteristics and complex formation by friction were examined. The book addresses to tribology researchers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Not only do individual consumers use liquid milk for beverages and cooking, but food manufacturers use vast quantities of milk powder, concentrated milks, butter, and cream as raw materials for further processing. Effective quality assurance in the dairy industry is needed now more than ever. This completely revised and expanded Third Edition of Dairy Microbiology Handbook, comprising both Volume I: Microbiology of Milk and Volume II: Microbiology of Milk Products, updates the discipline's authoritative text with the latest safety research, guidelines, and information.   Pathogens have become a major issue in dairy manufacturing. Escheria coli is a concern, and milk-borne strains of Mycobacterium avium sub-sp. paratuberculosis have been identified as a possible cause of Crohn's disease. Even little-known parasites like Cryptosporidium have caused disease outbreaks. Consequently, a hazard analysis of selected control/critical points (HACCP) in any manufacturing process has become essential to prevent the contamination of food. This volume also:   -Discusses new diagnostic techniques that allow a pathogen to be detected in a retail sample in a matter of hours rather than days  -Provides thorough coverage of dairy microbiology principles as well as practical applications  -Includes the latest developments in dairy starter cultures and genetic engineering techniques  -Offers completely updated standards for Good Manufacturing Practice   Quality control and product development managers, microbiologists, dairy scientists, engineers, and graduate students will find the Third Edition of Dairy Microbiology Handbook to be a vital resource.

The aim of this handbook is to offer for the first time a description of free radicals within an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary context, connecting structural characteristics and chemical properties to their applications in different areas of chemistry and related disciplines. The Handbook covers not only basic concepts and chemical synthesis, but also touches on various aspects concerning the role of free radicals in materials and life sciences. The reader will find a balanced contribution of topics related to free radicals covering for example, their role in proteomics, genomics and lipidomics as well as their enormous potential in synthesis and technology. The Handbook will be interesting for anybody working in the field of free radicals in the broadest sense. It will address scientists who want to enter the interdisciplinary field of free radicals. In particular, it is aimed primarily at chemists and life science researchers who want to gain a wider and deeper understanding of free radicals which will allow them to apply free radicals in their own scientific field. The book consists of four themed volumes:  Basic Concepts & Methodologies, Synthetic Strategies & Applications, Chemical Biology, Polymers & Materials. Within the volumes the chapters will also be thematically structured""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Over the years, many descriptions of chiral separation have appeared in academic journals and books, but most of them have been devoted to either the development of analytical methods and protocols or the summary of different chiral selectors, including cyclodextrins for chiral separation applications. This is in marked contrast to this volume which focuses on the research endeavors concerning the development of cyclodextrin derivatives specifically as either chiral mobile phases for capillary electrophoresis, or chiral stationary phases for various chromatographic techniques including gas chromatography, or high-performance liquid chromatography and supercritical fluid chromatography.^  The ongoing thread in this book is the synthesis of structurally-defined cyclodextrin derivatives and their applications in enantiomer separation by means of different analytical techniques. Modified Cyclodextrins for Chiral Separation is intended for those who are interested in expanding their knowledge of cyclodextrin chemistry and chiral separation, and in what cyclodextrin modification can be made to suit the needs of chiral selectors for different analytical techniques. It primarily focuses on the state-of-the-art cyclodextrin chemistry which is the basis for all chiral selectors used in these chiral separation techniques.

No other source offers as much data on the chemistry, engineering, economics, and infrastructure of the industry. The Handbook serves a spectrum of individuals, from those who are directly involved in the chemical industry to others in related industries and activities. It provides not only the underlying science and technology for important industry sectors, but also broad coverage of critical supporting topics. Industrial processes and products can be much enhanced through observing the tenets and applying the methodologies found in chapters on Green Engineering and Chemistry (specifically, biomass conversion), Practical Catalysis, and Environmental Measurements; as well as expanded treatment of Safety, chemistry plant security, and Emergency Preparedness. Understanding these factors allows them to be part of the total process and helps achieve optimum results in, for example, process development, review, and modification. Important topics in the energy field, namely nuclear, coal, natural gas, and petroleum, are covered in individual chapters. Other new chapters include energy conversion, energy storage, emerging nanoscience and technology. Updated sections include more material on biomass conversion, as well as three chapters covering biotechnology topics, namely, Industrial Biotechnology, Industrial Enzymes, and Industrial Production of Therapeutic Proteins.

Glasses, and especially silicate glasses, are only the best known representatives of this particular physical state of matter. Other typical representatives include organic polymer glasses, and many other easily vitrifying organic and inorganic substances, technically important materials, amidst them vitreous water and vitrified aqueous solutions, and also many metallic alloy systems. Some of these systems only form glasses under particular conditions, e.g. through ultra-rapid cooling. This book describes the properties and the formation of both every-day technical glasses and especially of such more exotic forms of vitreous matter.It is a unique source of knowledge and new ideas for materials scientists, engineers and researchers working on condensed matter. The new edition emphasizes latest experimental findings and modern theories, explaining the kinetics of glass formation, the relaxation and stabilization of glasses and their crystallization in terms of new models, derived from the framework of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. It shows how the properties of common technical glasses, window glass, or the vitreous ice kernel of comets can be used to develop a new understanding of the existence of matter in various, unusual forms. The developed theoretical models can find application even in the description of lasers and in unusual processes in the universe.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Amongst the anticipated advantages of spintronics technologies, researchers have identified the non-volatile storage of data with high density and low energy consumption as particularly relevant. This monograph examines the concept of half-metallic compounds perspectives to obtain novel solutions and discusses several oxides such as perovskites, double perovskites and CrO2 as well as Heusler compounds. Such materials can be designed and made with high spin polarization and, especially in the case of Heusler compounds, many material-related problems present in current-day 3d metal systems, can be overcome. Spintronics: From Materials to Devices provides an insight into the current research on Heusler compounds and offers a general understanding of structure–property relationships, including the influence of disorder and correlations on the electronic structure and interfaces. Spintronics devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) devices, with current perpendicular to the plane, in which Co2 based Heusler compounds are used as new electrode materials, are also introduced.From materials design by theoretical methods and the preparation and properties of the materials to the production of thin films and devices, this monograph represents a valuable guide to both novices and experts in the fields of Chemistry, Physics, and Materials Science.

This book discusses in great detail the effects of disorder on mesoscopic scales (fractures, aggregates, colloids, surfaces and interfaces, glasses, and polymers) and presents tools to describe them in mathematical language. A substantial part is devoted to the development of scaling theories based on fractal concepts. In 10 chapters written by leading experts in the field, including E. Stanley and B. Mandelbrot, the reader is introduced to basic concepts and techniques in disordered systems and is lead to the forefront of current research. In each chapter the connection between theory and experiment is emphasized, and a special chapter entitled ""Fractals and Experiments"" presents experimental studies of fractal systems in the laboratory. The book is written pedagogically. It can be used as a textbook for graduate students, by university teachers to prepare courses and seminars, and by active scientists who want to become familiar with a fascinating new field.

However,the complexity of the software and models often act as an inhibitor to the advancement of water quality science.A Basic Introduction to Pollutant Fate and Transport fills the need for a basic instructional tool for students and environmental professionals who lack the rigorous mathematical background necessary to derive the governing fate and transport equations. Taking a refreshingly simple approach to the subject that requires only a basic knowledge of algebra and first-year college chemistry, the book presents and integrates all of the aspects of fate and transport, including chemistry, modeling, risk assessment, and relevant environmental legislation; approaching each topic first conceptually before introducing the math necessary to model it.The first half of the book is dedicated to the chemistry and physics behind the fate and transport models, while the second half teaches and reinforces the logical concepts underlying fate and transport modeling. This better prepares students for support jobs in the environmental arena surrounding chemical industry and Superfund sites.Contributing to the book's ease of use are: An extremely user-friendly software program, Fate(r), which uses basic models to predict the fate and transport of pollutants in lakes, rivers, groundwater, and atmospheric systems The use of ""canned"" models to evaluate the importance of model parameters and sensitivity analysis A wealth of easy-to-understand examples and problems A chapter on environmental legislation in the United States and Europe A set of lab exercises, as well as a downloadable set of teaching aidsA much-needed basic text for contemporary hydrology or environmental chemistry courses and support courses forthe environmental industry, this is a valuable desk reference for educators and industry professionals.

These complexes have one-dimensional electronic structures, which cause the various physical properties as well as electronic structures. In most MX-chain complexes, the Pt and Pd units are in M(II)-M(IV) mixed valence or charge density wave (CDW) states due to electron-phonon interactions, and Ni compounds are in Ni(III) averaged valence or Mott-Hubbard states due to the on-site Coulomb repulsion. More recently, Pd(III) Mott-Hubbard (MH) states have been realized in the ground state by using the chemical pressure. Pt and Pd chain complexes undergo photo-induced phase transitions from CDW to MH or metal states, and Ni chain complexes undergo photo-induced phase transitions from MH to metal states. Ni chain complexes with strong electron correlations show tremendous third-order optical nonlinearity and nonlinear electrical conductivities. They can be explained theoretically by using the extended Peierls-Hubbard model. For MMX-chain complexes, averaged valence, CDW, charge polarization, and alternating charge polarization states have been realized by using chemical modification and external stimuli, such as temperature, photo-irradiation, pressure, and water vapor. All of the electronic structures and phase transitions can be explained theoretically.  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It covers fundamental aspects of aerosol spectroscopy, applications to atmospherically and astronomically relevant problems, and several aspects that need further research and development.Chapters in the book are arranged in order of decreasing wavelength of the light/electrons. The text starts with infrared spectroscopy, one of the most important aerosol characterization methods for laboratory studies, field measurements, remote sensing, and space missions. It then focuses on Raman spectroscopy for investigating aerosol processes in controlled laboratory studies and for analyzing environmental particles and atmospheric pollution. The next section discusses the use of cavity ring-down spectroscopy to measure light extinction, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy to identify and classify biological aerosol particles, and ultrafast laser techniques to improve the specificity of bioaerosol detection. The final section examines recent developments involving novel techniques based on UV, X-ray, and electron beam studies.This book offers the first comprehensive overview of the spectroscopy of aerosols. It includes some results for the first time in the literature and presents a unique link between fundamental aspects and applications""--  ""This book provides an overview of the state of the art in this rapidly developing field.

The initial classical approach to continuous control by transfer functions will be of enormous benefit, whether you are a student beginning in control or an engineer in industry who, up until now, has only had a land contact with control. The more advanced material on discrete control and the state space control, as well as nonlinear control and observers, requires minimal previous knowledge, allowing you to make better use of performing techniques. •Progressively introduces concepts of increasing difficulty, allowing a less brutal tuition of theories and control methods. • For each topic, the theories, techniques and algorithms are presented in detail, with numberous references. • The consideration of the same problems by different approaches will provoke a deep understanding. • All necessary explanations for your complete understanding of the subject. • Examples that you can reproduce to master the different techniques. Broad coverage creates and important synthesis on the majority of aspects of control that gives you a complete view of control theory and possible applications within the field. Different levels of reading are possible, opening this powerful source of information to students, engineers, academics and researchers alike.

Emergency action for chemical and biological warfare agents,D.

Ten city blocks away, a police special response team forms a perimeter around an office building where a terrorist threatens the release of a deadly chemical agent. Meanwhile, paramedics administer first aid to victims exposed to a possible vesicant.  In the real-life world of emergency response, nothing is more crucial to crisis personnel than quick and decisive action. D. Hank Ellison's Emergency Action for Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents tells police, paramedics, and firefighters just what actions to take in the event of a crisis involving hazardous materials.  The book contains abridged versions of the class indices from Ellison's larger Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents. The indices deal with classes of agents (nerve, blister, etc.) instead of focusing on specific agents. Each index contains information on the toxicology/health impacts, physical characteristics, hazards from fire or reactivity, protection of personnel, and general first aid for that agent class.  Designed to provide rapid access to critical emergency information at the scene of a release of chemical or biological warfare agents, this handy field guide is also ideal for facilitating the coordination with off-site personnel who have access to more comprehensive information in Ellison's larger Handbook. It differs from its larger companion, however, in that agent specific data, as well as information on evacuation distances, are listed in table format, making it the ideal tool for emergency responders deployed in the field.

Friedrich discusses the structure of atomic spectra on the basis of quantum defect theory, which is treated for the first time at such a basic level in a textbook. Special attention is given to highly excited states and to the influence of external fields, which can cause intricate and interesting effects in seemingly simple systems. After a chapter on reaction theory the final chapter treats special topics such as multiphoton absorption and chaos. The book contains the kind of advanced quantum mechanics needed for practical applications in modern atomic physics. The presentation is kept deliberately simple and avoids abstract formalism as far as possible.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Therefore, the membrane not only plays the role of a separator, but also takes place in the reaction itself.    This text covers, in detail, the preparation and characterisation of all types of membranes used in membranes reactors. Each membrane synthesis process used by membranologists is explained by well known scientists in their specific research field.    The book opens with an exhaustive review and introduction to membrane reactors, introducing the recent advances in this field. The following chapters concern the preparation of both organic and inorganic, and in both cases, a deep analysis of all the techniques used to prepare membrane are presented and discussed. A brief historical introduction for each technique is also included, followed by a complete description of the technique as well as the main results presented in the international specialized literature.    In order to give to the reader a summary look to the overall work, a conclusive chapter is included for collecting all the information presented in the previous chapters.  This text is intended for PhD students, chemical engineers, environmental engineers, materials science experts, biologists, researchers and is an ideal resource to those who intend to study and investigate membrane reactors""--  ""The discovery of new membrane materials was the key factor for increasing the application of the membrane in the catalysis field""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book presents the underlying theory of such quantum-state manipulation for researchers and graduate students. The book provides the equations, and approaches for their solution, which can be applied to complicated multilevel quantum systems. It also gives the background theory for application to isolated atoms or trapped ions, simple molecules and atoms embedded in solids. Particular attention is given to the ways in which quantum changes can be displayed graphically to help readers understand how quantum changes can be controlled""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book describes how galactomannans are currently produced commercially and how they have become industrial commodities. It provides a simple and clear introduction to these vital substances, it compares their various sources.HighlightsGeneral chapters on carbohydrates, hydrocolloids and associated rheology, interactions of galactomannans, and derivatization of polysaccharidesA brief history of each product gum, cultivation of the plant sources, seed, habitat, chemical structure, functional properties, manufacturing processes, and applicationsSpecial focus on the most representative galactomannans: guar and locust bean gumsAn in-depth compilation of industrial galactomannans information, this book is designed for the manufacturers, traders, and end users of galactomannans, as well as technologists in polysaccharides-related industries and scientists and academics interested in carbohydrates""--  ""Preface I have been associated with the guar gum (an industrial galactomannan polysaccharide) industry at Jodhpur, which is a city in the northwestern Rajasthan state of India, for nearly four decades now. Guar seed processing into its gum was started in India in late 1950s and early 1960s. This was based on transfer of technology by two U.S. companies (General Mills Co. and Stein, Hall & Co.) and establishing guar galactomannan-based industries in India with their collaboration. Subsequently similar industries were also established in Pakistan. With establishment of these industries on the Indian subcontinent, processing of guar seed into gum powder was gradually reduced in the United States and Europe. However the export of guar seed split from India has continued even now to most of Europe, Japan, and the United States, where some value-added specialty guar gum products are still manufactured according to secret and patented procedures. During the past two decades, there has been an increasing trend of outsourcing production of these so-called specialty products to Indian manufacturers. For several years the export-oriented guar gum industry in India, flourished and progressed well. This was mainly due to mastering of the technology of mechanical processing of guar seed into gum powder, without much understanding of underlying science and technology of the process and the product. India currently produces over 70% of the world production of guar seeds, most of which is processed into guar gum products and its by-products, including protein-rich cattle feed. Many guar gum industries in India are now emerging as multihydrocolloid industries processing, importing, or trading in hydrocolloids other than guar gum""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Molecular modeling for the design of novel performance chemicals and materials,Beena Rai,chemistry,First published in 2012,/works/OL16451150W,/authors/OL7062394A/Beena_Rai,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English,"""Preface Over the past few decades, molecular modeling (MM) has become an important tool in many academic institutions and industrial laboratories. While the role of MM in biological fields--especially in the design and development of novel drug molecules or formulations--is well established and acknowledged, its direct role in the design and development of performance chemicals and novel materials is still not well known. Questions such as, which new products have resulted from an MM-based approach? are still often asked. Although MM may be playing an important role in product development, quite often it becomes difficult to predict its direct impact because most of the time the problem being addressed involves a multidisciplinary approach. Further, the assumption that fundamental phenomena being modeled though MM will have a direct impact on the macroscopic and functional properties of a product make the situation more complicated. In most of the cases, MM actually works as an enabler toward novel product and material development (e.g., novel drug molecules in biological application) rather than directly coming up with new products and materials. This precisely is the reason that despite seeing value in MM tools, most engineers and practitioners are often focus on the question, how do I leverage these tools to design and develop novel materials or chemicals for the industry I am working with? Unfortunately, there is no simple answer to this question. Excellent books and very good research publications highlight the most intricate, fundamental, and theoretical details about MM techniques and tools""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For these studies the author primarily uses angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. ILs represent a class of materials with unique physico-chemical properties. Many applications take advantage of the extremely low vapor pressure of aprotic ILs to fabricate permanent, non-volatile liquid coatings on solid materials. The author focuses on issues related to thin IL coatings, in particular concerning new catalytic concepts such as the supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) and solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL) systems. Till Cremer presents a number of fundamental contributions to the new field of ""Ionic Liquid Surface and Interface Science"". Highlights are his results concerning anion/cation-interactions and the growth of ultrathin layers of ionic liquids on various substrates in the context of supported ionic liquid catalysis. His results have significantly contributed to the present level of understanding in the field and accordingly he is author and coauthor of ten publications on the topic in high-ranked journals.

Physicians tried for over a century, despite growing evidence to the contrary, to treat everything from paralysis to constipation with it. But strychnine proved only to be disappointingly deadly-relegating its fate almost entirely to animal control, the dangerous adulteration of foods, and criminal exploits.  The NOTORIOUS and TRUE story of how a POISONOUS alkaloid...  Bitter Nemesis: The Intimate History of Strychnine presents a scholarly and compelling history of this fascinating chemical substance from its discovery to present times. A renowned editor for the Dictionary of Natural Products, Dr. John Buckingham fuses his eclectic interests into an extraordinary mix of original research spanning the realms of history, medicine, literature, chemistry, and forensics.  ...Changed the course of HISTORY!  Uncovering details and logistics from the earliest experiments performed in an era when proper scientific trials for testing new drugs were still in their infancy, the author explores strychnine's trial-and-error contributions to scientific, medical, and forensic developments. He also investigates historical milestones and the perception of strychnine in popular culture-including criminal notoriety, accidental misuse, and new claims of strychnine's benefits that extend through to the present day.  Juxtaposing the real trials, mistrials, and persistent curiosity associated with one of history's most notorious pharmaceutical failures, Bitter Nemesis offers rare insight into the anarchic, yet inspired landscape, practices, and legacy of 19th century science.

It broadens the discussion on biofuels beyond bioethanol and biodiesel, taking into account the data, ideas, and bioproducts that have appeared over the last fifty years.    An Insider's Look at the Biotech Industry  Written by a seasoned expert in the biotech industry, the book analyzes in detail the present status and future prospects of biofuels, from ethanol and biodiesel to biotechnological routes to biohydrogen. It emphasizes the ways biotechnology can improve process economics as well as facilitate sustainable agroindustries and crucial elements of a biobased economy. The author also explores the additional innovations required in microbial and plant biotechnology, metabolic engineering, bioreactor design, and the genetic manipulation of novel biomass species of plants, such as softwoods and algae.    The Role of Biofuels in the Future  With over 1,000 references and nearly 200 graphs and tables of data, this well-researched, comprehensive work examines the past and present of various biofuels while considering the future of a biocommodity economy.

It is a hands-on guide to understanding the biology and biological conditions that occur at each treatment unit.    Avoiding unnecessary technical jargon and chemical equations, Wastewater Bacteria, the fifth book in the Wastewater Microbiology Series, explores and explains:   Bacteria and the wastewater environment   Enzymes and sludge production   Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur bacteria   Floc formation and filamentous organisms   Nitrification and denitrification   Sulfate reduction, fermentation, and methane production   Toxicity   Foam and malodor production    The goal of Wastewater Bacteria is to enable plant operators to achieve the twofold basic objectives of wastewater treatment-to degrade organic wastes to a level where a significant, dissolved oxygen demand is not exerted upon receiving waters and to remove nutrients to levels where photosynthetic organisms in receiving waters are limited in their growth. This straightforward manual equips plant technicians to meet these objectives with essential information to understand the biological processes and organisms involved in wastewater treatment.

Methods driving the latest automated structure determination pipelines are explained, as well as how to deal with problems such as crystal pathologies that still demand expert analysis.  These methods are illustrated through their application to problems of great biological interest, such as the molecular machinery underlying the complement pathway, the mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and the structure of the eukaryotic ribosome.  Complementary approaches, such as neutron diffraction, small angle X-ray scattering, coherent diffraction and computational modelling, are also explored.

Issues related to uncertainty quantification and its influence on the reliability of the computational models are continuously gaining in significance. In particular, the problems of dynamic response analysis and reliability assessment of structures with uncertain system and excitation parameters have been the subject of continuous research over the last two decades as a result of the increasing availability of powerful computing resources and technology.  This book is a follow up of a previous book with the same subject (ISBN 978-90-481-9986-0) and focuses on advanced computational methods and software tools which can highly assist in tackling complex problems in stochastic dynamic/seismic analysis and design of structures. The selected chapters are authored by some of the most active scholars in their respective areas and represent some of the most recent developments in this field. The book consists of 21 chapters which can be grouped into several thematic topics including dynamic analysis of stochastic systems, reliability-based design, structural control and health monitoring, model updating, system identification, wave propagation in random media, seismic fragility analysis and damage assessment. This edited book is primarily intended for researchers and post-graduate students who are familiar with the fundamentals and wish to study or to advance the state of the art on a particular topic in the field of computational stochastic structural dynamics. Nevertheless, practicing engineers could benefit as well from it as most code provisions tend to incorporate probabilistic concepts in the analysis and design of structures.

Applying to crystals, however, the laws encounter undefined properties of crystal lattice, which therefore need to be determined for a clear and well-defined description of crystalline states. Thermodynamics of Crystalline States explores the roles played by order variables and dynamic lattices in crystals in a wholly new way.The book begins by clarifying basic concepts for stable crystals. Next, binary phase transitions are discussed to study collective motion of order variables, as described mostly as classical phenomena. New to this edition is the examination of magnetic crystals, where magnetic symmetry is essential for magnetic phase transitions. The multi-electron system is also discussed  theoretically, as a quantum-mechanical example, for superconductivity in metallic crystals. Throughout the book, the role played by the lattice is emphasized and studied in-depth.Thermodynamics of Crystalline States is an introductory treatise and textbook on mesoscopic phenomena in solid states, constituting a basic subject in condensed matter physics. While this book serves as a guide for advanced students in physics and material science, it can also be useful as a reference for all professionals in related fields.

It is a description in terms of classical fields that pervade all space, and their quantal sources. The fields, which are explicitly defined, are separately representative of the many-body electron correlations present in such a description, namely, those due to the Pauli exclusion principle, Coulomb repulsion, correlation-kinetic, and correlation-current-density effects. The book further describes Schrödinger theory from the new perspective of fields and quantal sources. It also explains the physics underlying the functionals and functional derivatives of traditional DFT.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Computer simulation methods are indispensable in such studies and this book contains a substantial body of knowledge about simulation methods as well as the theoretical background for performing computer experiments and analyzing the data. The book is self-contained, covering a range of topics from classical statistical mechanics to a variety of simulation techniques, including molecular dynamics, Langevin dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. A number of physical systems are considered, including fluids, magnets, polymers, granular media, and driven diffusive systems. The computer simulation methods considered include both standard and accelerated versions. The simulation methods are clearly related to the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Handbook on Sourdough Biotechnology,Marco Gobbetti,chemistry,First published in 2012,/works/OL19854495W?edition=ia%3Ahandbookonsourdo00gobb,/authors/OL7324521A/Marco_Gobbetti,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27042735M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer US,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 298","Bread and leavened bakery products have been essential to human nourishment for millennia. Traditionally, bread production has relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent and to impart a characteristic quality to baked goods. In recent years, improved understanding of the biodiversity and microbial ecology of sourdough microbiota, the discovery of new species, and the commercialization of innovative products have vastly expanded the potential of sourdough fermentation for the production of baked goods. For example, raw materials such as cereals, pseudo-cereals, ancient grains, and gluten-free substrates, as well as a large number of baked good varieties (e.g., typical and industrial breads, sweet baked goods, gluten-free products) may benefit from advances in sourdough fermentation. In addition, biotechnological tools and culture properties have been discovered to improve both the shelf life and the sensory and textural qualities of baked goods, as well as their nutritional and health-promoting properties. Though sourdough has been and will remain a unique fermentation process, this is the first book dedicated completely to sourdough biotechnology. It reviews the history of sourdough and the potential of sourdough fermentation in the production of bread and baked goods. A thorough discussion of the various processing steps includes the chemical properties of the raw matter, the taxonomy, diversity, and metabolic properties of starter yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, and the effects of sourdough fermentation on the shelf life and the sensory, textural, nutritional, and health-promoting properties of baked goods.

The data were collected from September 1979 to October 1980 at the AMAX Phosphate, Inc., chemical plant, Piney Point; the USS Agri-Chemicals chemical plant, Bartow; and the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, Clear Springs Mine, Bartow. Approximately 5,400 field and laboratory water-quality determinations on water samples from 78 test holes and 31 surface-water, rainfall, and other sampling sites at phosphate industry beneficiation and chemical plant waste-disposal operations are tabulated. Records of the test holes and data collection sites as well as geologic and hydrologic data for selected test holes are presented. Maps show locations of the sampling sites.  Comments – This is a specialized data set collected by Ronald L. Miller, a chemist for the U.S. Geological Survey. The data set was rigorously checked for data quality. It shows the distance that chemical contamination moves away from the 2 gypsum stacks and 1 “slime pond”. This data set is the basis for the classic 184-page interpretive report by Ronald L. Miller and Horace Sutcliffe, Jr. on the migration of contaminants from phosphate industry waste disposal operations. The interpretive report is Miller, R. L., and Sutcliffe, H., Jr., 1984, Effects of three phosphate industrial sites on ground-water quality in central Florida, 1979 to 1980: U.S. Geol. Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 83-4256, 184 p. Horace Sutcliffe, Jr. is deceased. Ronald L. Miller has retired from the U.S. Geological Survey, but he is still active in the field of water-quality, drinking-water quality, and environmental chemistry under the name of Chem-Hydro Science and Consumer Products, LLC, in Tampa, Florida.

The majority of these problems cannot be solved analytically. This introduction to optimization attempts to strike a balance between presentation of mathematical theory and development of numerical algorithms. Building on students’ skills in calculus and linear algebra, the text provides a rigorous exposition without undue abstraction. Its stress on statistical applications will be especially appealing to graduate students of statistics and biostatistics. The intended audience also includes students in applied mathematics, computational biology, computer science, economics, and physics who want to see rigorous mathematics combined with real applications. In this second edition, the emphasis remains on finite-dimensional optimization. New material has been added on the MM algorithm, block descent and ascent, and the calculus of variations. Convex calculus is now treated in much greater depth.  Advanced topics such as the Fenchel conjugate, subdifferentials, duality, feasibility, alternating projections, projected gradient methods, exact penalty methods, and Bregman iteration will equip students with the essentials for understanding modern data mining techniques in high dimensions.

The authors give a correct treatment of the offset dependence and the temperature dependence of nonradiative rates. The Wp function is defined as the sum of thermally weighted Franck-Condon factors. It is obtained in one dimension in several forms, and a useful recursion relation is derived between Wp's with nearby p indices. Two classes of applications are considered. First, an exposition of the broad classes of luminescence behavior is given and the Wp function and related functions are applied to each. Then the detailed application of these functions to specific experimental data, namely, to Eu3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ in oxysulfides and oxychlorides and to Cr3+ in ruby is extensively discussed. The authors give a thorough review of the related literature. The many exact and approximate forms, some with certain errors, for Wp and related functions are listed and their relationship to Wp are given.

Very recently, we have found that most organic reactions can be carried out in the absence of a solvent, namely, in the solid state. In many cases, the solid-state reaction proceeds more easily and efficiently, and even more selectively than solution reaction. This shows that molecules move easily and selectively in the solid state. This finding changed the classical idea which suggests ""molecules do not move and reactions do not occur in the solid state"", and opened up a new research field for the study molecular dynamics in the solid state. The organic solid state reactions have many possibilities to be developed. For example, enantioselective reactions can easily be accomplished by carrying out the reaction in an inclusion complex crystal with an optically active host compound. Catalytic reactions also proceed in the solid state. Moreover, the solid-state reactions are more economical and ecologically sound. In the future, pollution-free synthetic procedures in the solid state will become increasingly important, not only in chemical industries but also in university laboratories.

Arthur Greenberg shows us this wonderful world in a unique and highly readable book.""  --Dr. John Emsley, author of The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison   ""Art Greenberg takes us, through text and lovingly selected images, on a 'magical mystery tour' of the chemical universe. No matter what page you open, there is a chemical story worth telling.""  --Dr. Roald Hoffmann, Nobel Laureate and coauthor of Chemistry Imagined   ""Chemistry has perhaps the most intricate, most fascinating, and certainly most romantic history of all the sciences. Arthur Greenberg's essays-delightful, learned, quirky, highly personal, and richly illustrated with contemporary drawings (many of great rarity and beauty)-provide a kaleidoscope of intellectual landscapes, bringing the experiments, the ideas, and the human figures of chemistry's past intensely alive.""  --Dr. Oliver Sacks, author of Awakenings   From Alchemy to Chemistry in Picture and Story takes you on an illustrated tour of chemistry's fascinating history, from its early focus on the spiritual relationship between man and nature to some of today's most cutting-edge applications. Drawing from rare publications and artwork that span over five centuries, the book contains nearly 200 essays and over 350 illustrations-including 24 in full color-that tell the engaging story of the development of this fundamental science and its connection with human history.   Join Arthur Greenberg as he combines the ""best of the best"" from his previous works (as well as several new essays) to paint a colorful picture of chemistry's remarkable origins!

In these phases, for many phenomena, the physical length scales are substantially smaller than the unit-cell dimension. Hence, these materials offer unique combinations of properties which are mutually exclusive in conventional materials, such as metallic electric conductivity combined with low thermal conductivity, good light absorption with high-temperature stability, high metallic hardness with reduced wetting by liquids, etc. This book is the second of a series of books issued yearly as a deliverable to the European Community of the School established within the European Network of Excellence CMA. Written by reputed experts in the fields of metal physics, surface physics, surface chemistry, metallurgy, and process engineering, this book brings together expertise found inside as well as outside the network to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in CMAs.

The answer is simple: at any level, thermodynamics is usually taught as a somewhat abstruse discipline where many students get lost in a maze of difficult concepts. However, thermodynamics is not as intricate a subject as most people feel. This book fills a niche between elementary textbooks and mathematically oriented treatises, and provides readers with a distinct approach to the subject. As indicated by the title, this book explains thermodynamic phenomena and concepts in physical terms before proceeding to focus on the requisite mathematical aspects. It focuses on the effects of pressure, temperature and chemical composition on thermodynamic properties and places emphasis on rapidly evolving fields such as amorphous materials, metastable phases, numerical simulations of microsystems and high-pressure thermodynamics. Topics like redox reactions are dealt with in less depth, due to the fact that there is already much literature available. Without requiring a background in quantum mechanics, this book also illustrates the main practical applications of statistical thermodynamics and gives a microscopic interpretation of temperature, pressure and entropy. This book is perfect for undergraduate and graduate students who already have a basic knowledge of thermodynamics and who wish to truly understand the subject and put it in a broader physical perspective. The book is aimed not at theoretical physicists, but rather at practitioners with a variety of backgrounds from physics to biochemistry for whom thermodynamics is a tool which would be better used if better understood.

This book introduces non-equilibrium thermodynamics and its applications to the rheology of multiphase flows. The subject is relevant to graduate students in chemical and mechanical engineering, physics and material science. This book is divided into two parts. The first part presents the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, reviewing its essential features and showing, when possible, some applications. The second part of this book deals with how the general theory can be applied to model multiphase flows and, in particular, how to determine their constitutive relations. Each chapter contains problems at the end, the solutions of which are given at the end of the book. No prior knowledge of statistical mechanics is required; the necessary prerequisites are elements of transport phenomena and on thermodynamics.“The style of the book is mathematical, but nonetheless it remains very readable and anchored in the physical world rather than becoming too abstract. Though it is up-to-date and includes recent important developments, there is a lot of classical material in the book, albeit presented with unprecedented clarity and coherence. The first six chapters are actually a very good introduction to the theory underlying many phenomena in soft matter physics, beyond the focus on flow and transport of the later chapters of the book.” Prof Richard A.L.

The theoretical sections are supported by many illustrations, and lay emphasis on a good understanding rather than rigorous mathematics. The most important data collection techniques, and the methods of data reduction, structure solution and refinement are discussed from a practical point of view. Many tips and insights help readers to recognise and avoid possible errors and traps, and to judge the quality of results. The second edition has been considerably updated, especially the chapter on experimental methods, which is now mainly concerned with modern data collection using area-detectors. From the reviews of the first edition: ""The book provides a nice balance between describing the mathematical fundamentals and offering practical advice on how to solve a crystal structure... appropriate for an undergraduate audience (particularly in chemistry) and for graduate students or researchers who find they need a better grasp of the subject... a very helpful addition to the collection of introductory texts in X-ray crystallography. Especially for its treatment of common errors in the collection of intensity data and in the interpretation of results."" Acta Crystallographica.

The rate coefficients for dispersive processes depend on time. In the case of a chemical reaction, the time dependence of the rate coefficient, k(t), termed the specific reaction rate, is rationalized in the following way. Reactions by their very nature have to disturb reactivity distributions of the reactants in condensed media, as the more reactive species are the first ones to disappear from the system. The extent of this disturbance depends on the ratio of the rates of reactions to the rate of internal rearrangements (mixing) in the system restoring the initial distribution in reactivity of reactants. If the rates of chemical reactions exceed the rates of internal rearrangements, then the initial distributions in reactant reactivity are not preserved during the course of reactions and the specific reaction rates depend on time. Otherwise the extent of disturbance is negligible and classical kinetics, with a constant specific reaction rate, k, termed the reaction rate constant, may be valid as an approximation. In condensed media dispersive dynamical processes are endemic and this is the first monograph devoted to these processes.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Polysaccharides are the most abundant natural organic materials and polysaccharide based graft copolymers are of great importance and widely used in various fields. Natural polysaccharides have recently received more attention due to their advantages over synthetic polymers by being non-toxic, biodegradable and available at low cost. Modification of polysaccharides through graft copolymerization improves the properties of polysaccharides. Grafting is known to improve the characteristic properties of the backbones. Such properties include water repellency, thermal stability, flame resistance, dye-ability and resistance towards acid-base attack and abrasion. Polysaccharides and their graft copolymers find extensive applications in diversified fields. Applications of modified polysaccharides include drug delivery devices, controlled release of fungicides, selective water absorption from oil-water emulsions, purification of water etc.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although their presence and impact has long been known, the recent genome-wide analysis of many eukaryotic genomes has uncovered their major role in genome dynamics and function. The present book explains how to recognize and study transposable elements, e.g. by using state-of-the-art strategies based on new-generation sequencing. Moreover, the impact of transposable elements on plant genome structure and function is reviewed in detail and illustrated in examples and case studies. The book is intended both for readers familiar with the field and for newcomers. With large-scale sequencing becoming increasingly available, more and more people will come across transposable element sequences in their data, and this volume will hopefully help to convince them that transposable elements are not just ""junk"" DNA, and may actually be the most interesting and fun part of their data!

A major advantage of this concept is its independence of assumptions like one-step many-electron transfers or ‘discrete’ discharge of complex species. Therefore this monograph is a unique resource for basic electrochemical research but also for many important applications such as electrodeposition, electrorefining, or electrowinning of polyvalent metals from molten salts and other ionic media.

The discovery and use of fossil energy, represented largely by coal, natural gas, and petroleum, have drastically reduced the utilization of biomass fuels. The technologies of generating electricity using biomass, producing bioliquid fuels, and powering motor vehicles using bioalcohols and blended gasolines have been developed and practiced since the early twentieth century. Up until recently, however, development interest in biofuels had lessened due to the availability of relatively inexpensive fossil energy resources as well as the handling and transportation convenience of these conventional fuel sources. Due to the strong growth of global transportation fuel demand, sharply escalating worldwide fossil energy prices, fear over the dwindling supply of petroleum and natural gas for the near future, and credible evidence linking global warming and climate change issues with the emission of greenhouse gases, global interest and R&D efforts in renewable alternative fuels have become intense and fiercely competitive, targeting both short- and long-term solutions to alternative energy needs. Although there are a number of options and routes for energy sustainability and independence via renewable alternative energy, bioenergy and biofuels certainly possess outstanding potential to provide solutions and relief to many of the immediate, intermediate, and long-term societal needs of clean energy and their associated challenges""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Appeared in the mid 60’s as solid-state alternatives for liquid dye lasers, they recently gained a new dimension after the demonstration of organic semiconductor lasers in the 90's. More recently, new perspectives appeared at the nanoscale, with organic polariton and surface plasmon lasers. After a brief reminder to laser physics, a first chapter exposes what makes organic solid-state organic lasers specific. The laser architectures used in organic lasers are then reviewed, with a state-of-the-art review of the performances of devices with regard to output power, threshold, lifetime, beam quality etc. A survey of the recent trends in the field is given, highlighting the latest developments with a special focus on the challenges remaining for achieving direct electrical pumping of organic semiconductor lasers. A last chapter covers the applications of organic solid-state lasers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ronald Schmidt and Gary Rodrick's Food Safety Handbook provides a single, comprehensive reference on all major food safety issues. This expansive volume covers current United States and international regulatory information, food safety in biotechnology, myriad food hazards, food safety surveillance, and risk prevention.   Approaching food safety from retail, commercial, and institutional angles, this authoritative resource analyzes every step of the food production process, from processing and packaging to handling and distribution. The Handbook categorizes and defines real and perceived safety issues surrounding food, providing scientifically non-biased perspectives on issues for professional and general readers. Each part is divided into chapters, which are then organized into the following structure: Introduction and Definition of Issues; Background and Historical Significance; Scientific Basis and Implications; Regulatory, Industrial, and International Implications; and Current and Future Implications. Topics covered include:    Risk assessment and epidemiology  Biological, chemical, and physical hazards  Control systems and intervention strategies for reducing risk or preventing food hazards, such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)  Diet, health, and safety issues, with emphasis on food fortification, dietary supplements, and functional foods  Worldwide food safety issues, including European Union perspectives on genetic modification     Food and beverage processors, manufacturers, transporters, and government regulators will find the Food Safety Handbook to be the premier reference in its field.

Analysing both social and environmental components of the issues - global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain and drought - the book offers a valuable integrative approach and a detailed analysis of environmental issues in a clear, non-technical manner. Emphasising the climatological dimension common to all environmental issues, Global Environmental Issues recognises the multi-faceted nature of the issues, their common causes and the possibility of common solutions. Assessment of socio-economic, cultural amd political factors provides a balanced introduction to both the dangers and advantages of human interference with the environment. What have we done to deserve our current environmental crisis? Can we solve our current environmental problems, or is it too late? This new edition of a best selling text is completely updated and expands to include greater detail and new material such as a new section on atmospheric modelling. A glossary has been added together with a bibliography for further reading at the end of each chapter, allowing readers to develop their interest in specific areas. The interdisciplinary text will prove invaluable to students in geography, environmental studies and other courses in whcih the environmental approach is emphasised.

Such systems are important because they provide materials with novel properties, and they will be particularly useful for minimizing electronic devices. Molecular systems often form organized molecular crystals, polymers, or thin films that are significantly more complex than current materials. To provide a sound basis for understanding these levels of complexity, this book provides an analysis of the fundamentals of electronic structures, dynamic processes in condensed phases, and the unique properties of organic molecular solids and the environmental effects on these properties. Also covered are the latest methods in physical chemistry that are particularly useful for deriving and controlling the functionality of molecular systems.

The main scientific domain of the conference was the interaction between a magnetic field and a conducting fluid, which can be either an electrolyte (with low electrical conductivity) or a liquid metal (with high electrical conductivity). One of the perspectives of the conference was to facilitate the interaction between the MHD and chemical engineering communities. Thus, the connection between mass transfer in electrochemical systems and magnetic fields (sometimes called magnetoelectrolysis) was introduced for the first time as a topic of the conference. This offered a new class of problems to the MHD community. The presentations focused on four main topics related to interfacial heat and mass transfer phenomena, energetic applications, the dynamo effect and MEHD phenomena, and they encompassed both numerical and experimental studies. The invited lectures were devoted to different subjects, such as the dynamo effect, magnetoelectrolysis, instability problems, and metallurgical applications of MHD. The state of the art was discussed together with promising new orientations. This book will be of interest to researchers and advanced graduate students in physics and engineering sciences, working in MHD and related areas.

The manual includes introductory information, such as report formats (both academic and industrial), as well as a series of eleven full-length lab exercises suitable for a three-hour laboratory period.  There are also four shorter exercises suitable for a  traditional class period, and one group exercise suitable for a semester project in descriptive analysis and terminology building.  Correct use of graphs, tables and statistics is emphasized in several sections.  Each exercise includes both a student section and one for instructors and teaching assistants, which features detailed instructions with supplies, equipment, preparation procedures, ballots and data sheets.  Each instructor section also includes “keys to successful execution,” which cover common mistakes and important details, designed to give the students the maximum opportunity for a rich learning experience.  A group of statistical problem sets is included to reinforce common statistical analyses used with sensory data.  Methods encountered include discrimination, descriptive, affective/hedonic, scaling, thresholds, panelist screening, shelf life and consumer questionnaires.  Critical thinking and discussion questions are emphasized above and beyond the rote learning of a specific procedure.  For classes that may be offered to less advanced students, suggestions are made in the instructor sections on how the exercise or report can be simplified.  The exercises were compiled and refined over two decades and used in an upper level course in sensory testing at Cornell University.

It is particularly suited for the calculation of the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of solid-state materials. Recent developments allow application, in addition, to the elastic properties and phonon spectra. Due to the localized nature of the ASW basis set these properties can be easily interpreted in terms of atomic-like orbitals. The book addresses all those who want to learn about methods for electronic structure calculations and the ASW method in particular. This new edition has been thoroughly revised and extended. In particular, a chapter on the new, both very efficient and accurate spherical-wave based full potential ASW method has been added.

The applications discussed in this volume come predominantly from the fields of electrochemistry and biology. In contrast to those described in STM I, these studies may be performed in air and in liquids. The extensions of the basic technique to map other interactions are described in chapters on scanning force microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and scanning near-field optical microscopy, together with a survey of other related techniques. Also described here is the use of a scanning proximal probe for surface modification. Together, the two volumes give a comprehensive account of experimental aspects of STM. They provide essential reading and reference material for all students and researchers involved in this field. In this second edition the text has been updated and new methods are discussed.

The utility of the isotopes are ever-increasing and our sole focus is to bring out the applications of these isotopes as tracers and chronometers to a wider audience so that they can be used as powerful tools to solve environmental problems. New developments in this field remain mostly in peer-reviewed journal articles and hence our goal is to synthesize these findings for easy reference for students, faculty, regulators in governmental and non-governmental agencies, and environmental companies. While this volume maintains its rigor in terms of its depth of knowledge and quantitative information, it contains the breadth needed for wide variety problems and applications in the environmental sciences. This volume presents all of the newer and older applications of isotopes pertaining to the environmental problems in one place that is readily accessible to readers. This book not only has the depth and rigor that is needed for academia, but it has the breadth and case studies to illustrate the utility of the isotopes in a wide variety of environments (atmosphere, oceans, lakes, rivers and streams, terrestrial environments, and sub-surface environments) and serves a large audience, from students and researchers, regulators in federal, state and local governments, and environmental companies""--Publisher description.

Complete with examples from the chemical and pharmaceutical laboratory and manufacturing areas, this thoroughly updated book clearly demonstrates how to obtain reliable results by choosing the most appropriate experimental design and data evaluation methods.  Unlike other books on the subject, Statistical Methods in Analytical Chemistry, Second Edition presents and solves problems in the context of a comprehensive decision-making process under GMP rules: Would you recommend the destruction of a $100,000 batch of product if one of four repeat determinations barely fails the specification limit? How would you prevent this from happening in the first place? Are you sure the calculator you are using is telling the truth? To help you control these situations, the new edition:   Covers univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data   Features case studies from the pharmaceutical and chemical industries demonstrating typical problems analysts encounter and the techniques used to solve them   Offers information on ancillary techniques, including a short introduction to optimization, exploratory data analysis, smoothing and computer simulation, and recapitulation of error propagation   Boasts numerous Excel files and compiled Visual Basic programs-no statistical table lookups required!   Uses Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate the variability inherent in statistically indistinguishable data sets  Statistical Methods in Analytical Chemistry, Second Edition is an excellent, one-of-a-kind resource for laboratory scientists and engineers and project managers who need to assess data reliability; QC staff, regulators, and customers who want to frame realistic requirements and specifications; as well as educators looking for real-life experiments and advanced students in chemistry and pharmaceutical science.  From the reviews of Statistical Methods in Analytical Chemistry, First Edition:  ""This book is extremely valuable. The authors supply many very useful programs along with their source code. Thus, the user can check the authenticity of the result and gain a greater understanding of the algorithm from the code. It should be on the bookshelf of every analytical chemist.""-Applied Spectroscopy  ""The authors have compiled an interesting collection of data to illustrate the application of statistical methods . . . including calibrating, setting detection limits, analyzing ANOVA data, analyzing stability data, and determining the influence of error propagation.""-Clinical Chemistry  ""The examples are taken from a chemical/pharmaceutical environment, but serve as convenient vehicles for the discussion of when to use which test, and how to make sense out of the results. While practical use of statistics is the major concern, it is put into perspective, and the reader is urged to use plausibility checks.""-Journal of Chemical Education  ""The discussion of univariate statistical tests is one of the more thorough I have seen in this type of book . . . The treatment of linear regression is also thorough, and a complete set of equations for uncertainty in the results is presented . . . The bibliography is extensive and will serve as a valuable resource for those seeking more information on virtually any topic covered in the book.""-Journal of American Chemical Society  ""This book treats the application of statistics to analytical chemistry in a very practi...

With water as its only by-product and its availability in all parts of the world, hydrogen promises to be the next great fuel source.    All of the Key Aspects of Hydrogen Fuel  Hydrogen Fuel: Production, Transport, and Storage describes various aspects of hydrogen fuel, including production from both renewable and nonrenewable sources, purification, storage, transport, safety, codes, and carbon dioxide sequestration. The book examines the unique properties and uses of the hydrogen molecule, its ability to be produced from numerous energy sources, and its separation and purification. It explains how to transport hydrogen using pipelines and tankers and how to store it using compressed tanks, metal hydrides, carbon adsorbents, and chemical hydrides. The expert contributors also discuss codes and standards, monitoring techniques, and safety designs.    The Path to a Cleaner World and Energy Independence  Focusing on a clean, economical alternative to nonrenewable energy, this volume provides the latest information on the hydrogen fuel economy.

Against the tide of the general preference for empiricism and concrete policy making, this book insists on the indispensability of theoretical models which may help us to interpret social processes, including environmental change and the multi-level discourse about it. It questions why radical ecological criticism has had such little impact on contemporary society, despite the urgency of the issues it highlights, and offers a challenging theoretical critique of ecological thought itself.

As expected in Schwabl's works, the text features a compelling mathematical presentation in which all intermediate steps are derived and where numerous examples for application and exercises help the student to gain a thorough working knowledge of the subject. The treatment of relativistic wave equations and their symmetries and the fundamentals of quantum field theory lay the foundations for advanced studies in solid-state physics, nuclear and elementary particle physics. This text extends and complements Schwabl's introductory Quantum Mechanics, which covers nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and offers a short treatment of the quantization of the radiation field.

The first part describes the basic theory underlying the LCAO methods  applied to periodic systems and the use of Hartree-Fock(HF), Density Function theory(DFT) and hybrid Hamiltonians. The translation and site symmetry consideration is included to establish connection between k-space solid –state physics and real-space quantum chemistry. The inclusion of electron correlation effects for periodic systems is considered on the basis of localized crystalline orbitals. The possibilities of LCAO methods for chemical bonding analysis in periodic systems are discussed. The second part deals with the applications of LCAO methods  for calculations of bulk crystal properties, including magnetic ordering and crystal structure optimization.  In the second edition two new chapters are added in the application part II of the book.  Chapter 12  deals with the recent LCAO calculations and illustrates  the efficiency of the scalar-relativistic LCAO method for solids, containing heavy atoms. Chapter 13 deals with the symmetry properties and the recent applications of LCAO method to inorganic nanotubes. New material  is added to chapter 9 devoted to LCAO calculations of perfect-crystal properties. The possibilities of LCAO method for calculation of  the high-frequency dielectric constants of crystals and the description of phase transitions in solids are discussed. The efficiency of LCAO method in the quantum-mechanics-molecular dynamics approach to the interpretation of x-ray absorption and EXAFS spectra is illustrated. A new section is devoted to recent LCAO calculations of  electronic,  vibrational and magnetic properties of tungstates MeWO4 (Me: Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn,Cd).

Comprehensive in scope, it covers the entire subject, from its mathematical foundations to every current application, including crystallography. Beginning with a thorough presentation of the rigorous mathematical basis for group theory in chemistry, the book develops this foundation in a clear, step-by-step manner oriented to the chemist. It covers principles, including definitions, molecular symmetry, representation of groups, and quantum mechanics. Then, Chemical Applications of Group Theory illustrates how these principles are applied in a variety of chemical theories such as the molecular orbital (M.O.) theory of organic molecules -- including Woodward-Hoffmann rules; the M.O. theory of inorganic molecules and complexes, including hybridization, M-M multiple bonds, and electron counting in cluster compounds; ligand field theory; vibrational spectra; and the symmetry of crystals. Totally up-to-date, the Third Edition of this highly successful reference features end-of-chapter exercises. Chemical Applications of Group Theory is an unprecedented and invaluable resource for chemists in industry and academia. - Jacket flap.  This book aims to teach the use of symmetry arguments to the typical experimental chemist in a way that he will find meaningful and useful. At the same time I have tried to avoid that excessive and unnecessary superficiality which only leads, in the end, to incompetence and its attendant frustrations. The student who masters this book will know what he is doing, why he is doing it, and how to do it. The range of subject matter is that which, in my judgment, the great majority of organic, inorganic, and physical chemists are likely to encounter in their daily research activity. - Preface.

Water is free, there is plenty of it, plus it carries what is generally believed to be the best long-term source of green energy—hydrogen. Water for Energy and Fuel Production explores the many roles of water in the energy and fuel industry. The text not only discusses water’s use as a direct source of energy and fuel—such as hydrogen from water dissociation, methane from water-based clathrate molecules, hydroelectric dams, and hydrokinetic energy from tidal waves, off-shore undercurrents, and inland waterways—but also: Describes water’s benign application in the production of oil, gas, coal, uranium, biomass, and other raw fuels, and as an energy carrier in the form of hot water and steam Examines water’s role as a reactant, reaction medium, and catalyst—as well as steam’s role as a reactant—for the conversion of raw fuels to synthetic fuels Explains how supercritical water can be used to convert fossil- and bio-based feedstock to synthetic fuels in the presence and absence of a catalyst Employing illustrative case studies and commercial examples, Water for Energy and Fuel Production demonstrates the versatility of water as a provider of energy and fuel, conveying the message that as energy demand and environmental concerns grow, so should our vigilance in pursuing the role of water in the energy landscape.

These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration, and made possible the voyages of discovery that ensued. The molecules resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine and law; they determined what we now eat, drink, and wear. A change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous alterations in the properties of a substance-which, in turn, can result in great historical shifts.With lively prose and an eye for colorful and unusual details, Le Couteur and Burreson offer a novel way to understand the shaping of civilization and the workings of our contemporary world.

With more than 21 million people now using Prozac and other anti-depressants worldwide, this book comprises an enormous breakthrough: an all-natural method anyone can use to regain control of their physical and emotional health.Robertson, an expert in pharmacology and brain chemistry, has been using this method with remarkable success for more than twenty years. His approach uses the body's own natural chemistry to restore the brain's chemical balance and end the dangerous cycle of negative thought patterns and behaviour that cause depression to recur. With detailed instructions on developing a tailored program of diet and exercise, new techniques for understanding and breaking free of negative habits, and targeted exercises for burning up self-destructive chemicals. Natural Prozac gives every depression sufferer a new option.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hermes Trismegistus or Ostanes, as my Byzantine filter bring in front. Mather; Cleopatra with Casiopeea or Marie with Bain Marie?    Or is a story like Prometheus adventure?      Today transmutation is done. Tomorrow ...  Looking through the Rodwell eyes (that's the magic of the books with this subject) from the shoulders of giants (that's the magic of learning) I stick together few pieces of the puzzle using scientific method (that's Bibliography).     Let's have a look over content: - Ancient Science - Origin of Chemistry - Definition of the Name - Definitions of Chemical Science; Early ideas relative to the formation of the World - Thales of Miletus - Later Beliefs in his Doctrine - Anaximenes - Empedokles - Herakleitos - Anaxagoras - Demokritos - The Atomic Theory - Aristotle - The Ethereal Medium - Transmutation of the Elements - The Four-element theory - Mode of interpreting it - Cause of the absence of Natural Science among the Ancients - Practical Chemistry of the Ancients - Metallurgy: Gold, Silver, Elect rum, Copper, Bronze, Tin Iron, Lead, Silver - Colors used for Painting and Dyeing - Glass - Certain Minerals known to the Ancients - Miscellaneous Processes...and this is only the beginning.    Magic is not missing until Chemistry is born. Or is still present?    ""The term alchemy itself comes from two roots: al, which is Arabic for “the,” and chemeia It is unclear what chemeia actually means. There were two forms of the term in Greek: chemeia and chymia. The former refers to the process of extracting juice, while the later has to do with deriving metals from ore. For both forms, the transmutative processes comprise the common element, the transformation of a given substance into a higher one. We might, therefore, think of alchemy as the art of transmutation."" (Jung and the Alchemical Imagination; Jeffrey Raff)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These nanodimensional structures greatly accelerate biological reactions. The chirality of the reactants also has a strong influence on the process, but its importance in such biological reactions has only recently begun to be understood. This book explores the influence of chirality on reaction mechanisms in such biological nanospaces. The text addresses the influence of the chirality of amino acid and sugar in the active sites of transferase, oxidoreductases, hydrolases, lysases, isomerase, ligases, and other systems. It also covers ribosomal architecture""--Provided by publisher.  ""Discusses the relationship of molecular chirality and biology.

Exploring Environmental Issues provides a key to understanding our potential crisis.  The concise, introductory text presents a review of current environmental issues using a geographical approach that stresses the interrelationships between environment and societies.Environmental concerns are seldom new. The text begins by placing the issues and approaches in a historical framework.  The major physical and societal concerns are then considered to provide a base for understanding the nature and development of current environmental concerns. The causes, characteristics, and impacts of individual problems such as global warming, drought and atmospheric pollution are all explored.  The text concludes by evaluating potential solutions through a consideration of such elements as technology, politics, economics and planning. Emphasis throughout is placed on providing a balanced integrated approach covering both the physical, economic, political and socioeconomic causes of environmental problems as well as exploring the solutions these approaches entail.This user-friendly volume is an essential book for students and all who are concerned with the nature of contemporary environmental issues. Information is presented in a refreshing manner utilising over 170 figures and 50 photographs.  Global boxed case studies are used throughout to highlight and explore issues in more detail.  The text also contains discussion points, annotated further reading and an extensive glossary.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wiley|Language English,"This book explores the way in which quantum theory has become central to our understanding of the behaviour of atoms and molecules. It looks at the way in which this underlies so many of the experimental measurements we make, how we interpret those experiments and the language which we use to describe our results. It attempts to provide an account of the quantum theory and some of its applications to chemistry.   This book is for researchers working on experimental aspects of chemistry and the allied sciences at all levels, from advanced undergraduates to experienced research project leaders, wishing to improve, by self-study or in small research-orientated groups, their understanding of the ways in which quantum mechanics can be applied to their problems. The book also aims to provide useful background material for teachers of quantum mechanics courses and their students.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Small-scale synthesis of laboratory reagents with reaction modeling,Leonid Lerner,chemistry,First published in 2011,/works/OL16113655W?edition=ia%3Asmallscalesynthe00lern,/authors/OL638375A/Leonid_Lerner,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25001398M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English,"""The in-lab preparation of some chemical reagents provides a number of advantages over purchasing commercially-prepared samples. This volume contains a detailed description of methods for the rapid and reliable synthesis of many useful reagants that are otherwise difficult to obtain. It provides spectroscopic analyses of products, presents the thermodynamic/kinetic data of reactions, and offers a thorough analysis of the purity of the final products. Enhanced by useful diagrams and photographs, this text is a valuable reference for researchers in small or remote laboratories""--  ""When working in a small chemical laboratory attached to a non-chemistry specific project one is frequently asked to solve problems which occur in the main project. Usually one can think of several solutions and experimental testing is required to choose between the different approaches, or indeed to find an approach that works. These often require the use of small amounts of chemicals which the laboratory does not stock. Obtaining these chemicals from commercial suppliers in a suitable timeframe sometimes poses problems. This is particularly the case in isolated regions such as Australasia, when the supplier has no local stocks of hazardous substances and they have to be brought in from overseas, something which can introduce delays from several weeks to six months or more. Since there is no certainty that the substance whose acquisition is introducing the delay will form part of the ultimate solution, this delay is particularly objectionable. The primary aim of this book is therefore to provide reliable laboratory syntheses of the most common reagents whose acquisition can introduce delays due to their hazardous nature. It is apparent that there is little point in replacing delays in reagent purchase with uncertainties in their synthesis, hence the preparations presented in this book were chosen with the following criteria in mind: short duration, availability of apparatus, high yield, and high purity of the product. It was also considered necessary for the syntheses to be described in greater detail than is normally provided in the literature, since I have frequently found that omission of apparently small details can subsequently waste much time""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is not an awards list. It is not a list of the 101 'best' whiskies in the world in the opinion of a self-appointed whisky guru. It is simply a guide to the 101 whiskies that enthusiasts must seek out and try in order to complete their whisky education. Avoiding the deliberately obscure, the ridiculously limited and the absurdly expensive, whisky expert Ian Buxton recommends an eclectic selection of old favourites, stellar newcomers and mystifyingly unknown drams that simply have to be drunk. The book decodes the marketing hype and gets straight to the point; whether from India, America, Sweden, Ireland, Japan or the hills, glens and islands of Scotland, here are the 101 whiskies that you really want to try.

In particular, the book:Introduces the history, nomenclature, and working principles of extrusion technologyPresents an overview of various types of extruders as well as parts and components of an extruder for design considerationsDiscusses extruder selection and design, fluid flow problem with different types of raw materials, and heat transfer and viscous energy dissipation, with advantages and limitations for particular casesEmphasizes recent research while providing an overview of trends previously reported in the literatureCovers the coinjection of food substances into an extruder die with the objective of creating defined colored patterns, adding internal flavors, and achieving other food injection applications into cereal-based extruded productsDescribes thermal and nonthermal extrusion of protein productsDiscussing the influence of design and raw materials on extruder performance and nutritional value, this book covers current and developing products from cereal-based snacks to pet food. In addition to the usual benefits of heat processing, extrusion offers the possibility of modifying and expanding the functional properties of food ingredients. Designed for both the active and future food scientist, this book is an exciting addition to a creative and ever-evolving field. ""--  ""Preface Eating and drinking foods are vital habits of human. During the centuries, different practical techniques and skills were developed by people all around the world to process foods. In recent years extrusion cooking, which is a specialized form of processing, has become a well established industrial technology, with a number of foods and feed applications. It is a high temperature, short time process being used increasingly in the food industries for the development of new products such as cereal-based snacks including dietary fiber, baby foods, pasta products, breakfast cereals, texturized protein food stuffs and modified starch from cereals. In addition to the usual benefits of heat processing, extrusion offers the possibility of modifying the functional properties of food ingredients and/or expanding them. Extrusion cooking as a continuous cooking, mixing and shaping process, is a versatile and very efficient technology in food processing. In the extruder, the food mix is thermomechanically cooked to a high temperature (usually in the range 100ʻC-180ʻC), pressure and shear stress are generated in the screw-barrel assembly. The cooked melt is then texturized and shaped in the die. Extrusion-cooked melts go from high pressure to low (atmospheric) pressure when they exit the die. This sudden pressure drop causes part of the internal moisture and the vapor pressure to flash off forming bubbles in the molten extrudate, resulting in the expansion of melt.

Evans,chemistry,First published in 2013,/works/OL19827357W?edition=ia%3Aappliedphotochem00doug,/authors/OL7555803A/Rachel_C._Evans,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27017653M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Netherlands,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 598","Applied Photochemistry encompasses the major applications of the chemical effects resulting from light absorption by atoms and molecules in chemistry, physics, medicine and engineering, and contains contributions from specialists in these key areas. Particular emphasis is placed both on how photochemistry contributes to these disciplines and on what the current developments are. The book starts with a general description of the interaction between light and matter, which provides the general background to photochemistry for non-specialists. The following chapters develop the general synthetic and mechanistic aspects of photochemistry as applied to both organic and inorganic materials, together with types of materials which are useful as light absorbers, emitters, sensitisers, etc. for a wide variety of applications.^  A detailed discussion is presented on the photochemical processes occurring in the Earth’s atmosphere, including discussion of important current aspects such as ozone depletion. Two important distinct, but interconnected, applications of photochemistry are in photocatalytic treatment of wastes and in solar energy conversion. Semiconductor photochemistry plays an important role in these and is discussed with reference to both of these areas. Free radicals and reactive oxygen species are of major importance in many chemical, biological and medical applications of photochemistry, and are discussed in depth. The following chapters discuss the relevance of using light in medicine, both with various types of phototherapy and in medical diagnostics. The development of optical sensors and probes is closely related to diagnostics, but is also relevant to many other applications, and is discussed separately.^  Important aspects of applied photochemistry in electronics and imaging, through processes such as photolithography, are discussed and it is shown how this is allowing the increasing miniaturisation of semiconductor devices for a wide variety of electronics applications and the development of nanometer scale devices. The final two chapters provide the basic ideas necessary to set up a photochemical laboratory and to characterise excited states. This book is aimed at those in science, engineering and medicine who are interested in applying photochemistry in a broad spectrum of areas. Each chapter has the basic theories and methods for its particular applications and directs the reader to the current, important literature in the field, making Applied Photochemistry suitable for both the novice and the experienced photochemist.

Heteroepitaxy represents the basis of advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices today and is considered one of the top fields in materials research. The book covers the structural and electronic properties of strained epitaxial layers, the thermodynamics and kinetics of layer growth, and the description of the major growth techniques metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy, molecular beam epitaxy and liquid phase epitaxy. Cubic semiconductors, strain relaxation by misfit dislocations, strain and confinement effects on electronic states, surface structures and processes during nucleation and growth are treated in detail. The Introduction to Epitaxy requires only little knowledge on solid-state physics. Students of natural sciences, materials science and electrical engineering as well as their lecturers benefit from elementary introductions to theory and practice of epitaxial growth, supported by pertinent references and over 200 detailed illustrations.

Nathan S. Lewis and Daniel G. Nocera Henry Dreyfus Professor of Energy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Lewis and Nocera 2006) The image on the cover is that of the solar-powered airplane Solar Impulse high over Belgium in 2011. The goal of Solar Impulse is grand: to fly both night and day relying solely upon solar energy. More broadly, however, Solar Impulse is meant to inspire: it is an innovation that has risen to a technological challenge to demonstrate that clean and sustainable energy can be achieved. It is an inspiration that is much needed when the impacts of global climate change are all around us. Based on the globally averaged temperature, 2012 was the tenth-warmest year since record-keeping began in 1880, and 2001-2012 rank among the 14 warmest years in this 133-year period. In the United States, 2012 was the warmest on record for the contiguous states and one of the most extreme with respect to temperature, precipitation, and tropical cyclones; 2013 promises to continue with respect to extreme weather events (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012). Where is this climate change coming from? Overwhelming evidence points to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases--particularly carbon dioxide--in our atmosphere, a result of our insatiable consumption of fossil fuels (Bernstein et al. 2008). While writing this text, the alarming milestone of 400 ppm atmospheric CO2 was surpassed--an ominous harbinger of climate change to come""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Introduction to lipidomics,Claude Leray,chemistry,First published in 2012,/works/OL16714701W,/authors/OL7155819A/Claude_Leray,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English,"""The first comprehensive book on lipidomics, this long-awaited work inventories the huge variety of lipid molecules present in all aspects of life. It uses sensitive analytical techniques, such as mass spectrometry, to characterize structures and simplify the association of names with their appropriate structures. Fulfilling the spirit of inclusiveness, it details structures from marine ecosystems, little known structures from bibliographic data, cultural references and context, biological functions, and possible pharmacological properties. The text is highly informative and educational while simultaneously being anecdotal and interesting to read""--  ""Preface Classification Since the origins of organic chemistry, lipids or fats were reduced to a mixture of solid greases (or tallow) and fluid oils (concept of H. Braconnot, 1815), but it was M.E. Chevreul who proposed in 1823 the first logical classification. Thus, he classified all lipids known at that time in two divisions and six kinds based on a physical property (distillation) and on a chemical property (saponification) as well as on the nature of the components of these lipids. Beside oils, greases, tallow, and waxes, Chevreul included in the concept of fat, the resins, the balsams, and volatile oils (or essential oils). One can thus say that in the light of the current data, the classification of the lipids by Chevreul is the model of that still accepted almost two centuries later. Although phosphorylated lipids were discovered in the mammalian brain and the hen egg in 1847 by the French chemist T.N. Gobley, for approximately a century after, chemists regarded lipids (""fats"") as only the simple lipids made of fatty acids and glycerol. American chemists quickly integrated the discovery of many phospholipids and glycolipids by the German physician J.L. Thudichum (1874-1884) and proposed by 1920 a unified classification of ""lipoids"" distributed in three groups the simple lipoids (greases and waxes), the complex lipoids (phospholipids and glycolipids), and the parent lipoids (fatty acids, alcohols, sterols). In 1923, French chemist G. Bertrand provided the foundations of a new nomenclature in biological chemistry and proposed the term ""lipides,"" including not only the traditional fats (glycerides) but also the ""lipoids,"" molecules with ""complex constitution,"" such as cholesterol esters or the cerebrosides""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, with most chemical engineering application problems having many variables with complex inter-relationships, meeting these optimization objectives can be challenging. This is where Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is useful to find the optimal trade-offs among two or more conflicting objectives.This book provides an overview of the recent developments and applications of MOO for modeling, design and operation of chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, energy and related processes. It then covers important theoretical and computational developments as well as specific applications such as metabolic reaction networks, chromatographic systems, CO2 emissions targeting for petroleum refining units, ecodesign of chemical processes, ethanol purification and cumene process design.Multi-Objective Optimization in Chemical Engineering: Developments and Applications is an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students in chemical engineering as well as industrial practitioners and engineers involved in process design, modeling and optimization""--  ""This book provides researchers and postgraduate students with an overview of the recent developments and novel applications of multi-objective optimization (MOO) in chemical engineering""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Self-assembly and nanotechnology systems,Yoon S. Lee,chemistry,First published in 2011,/works/OL16643799W,/authors/OL7128375A/Yoon_S._Lee,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Wiley|Language English|Pages 459,"""Nanofabrication can be viewed as a close-to-manufacturing process for nanotechnology systems, nanoassembly is an engineering platform that backs up nanofabrication, and self-assembly is one of the core scientific principles behind nanoassembly. This book provides a systematic explanation of self-assembly, nanoassembly, and nanofabrication; it then networks them together into one book. The book is divided into four parts. The first part shows the assembly building units, and how diverse their origins and structures can be. It also presents how to analyze the building unit structures in a systematic manner. This is be called segmental analysis which is used as an underlying concept for the discussions throughout the book. The second and third parts show the designs and applications of nanotechnology systems, respectively, and how to select proper assembly principles and methods. The last part shows how to select proper characterization techniques and predictive models.This book serves as a companion book and expands on the author's previous book Self-Assembly and Nanotechnology: A Force Balance Approach by using the concepts from that book as a foundation for informatic approach to self-assembly, which can be directly expanded into nanoassembly, and into nanofabrication, which provides an effective way to design/fabricate nanofabricated systems. These topics can be used to develop a variety of nanotechnology systems effectively and efficiently, which could pave a way to green nanotechnology with its potential for economically-sound and environment-friendly nanoscale processes""--Provided by publisher.

It is of growing interest to chemists and has been applied to problems in such areas as food quality control, chemical reaction monitoring, metabolite analysis, QSAR/QSPR, and toxicity. This book presents the theory of SVMs in a way that is easy to understand regardless of mathematical background. It includes simple examples of chemical and OMICS data to demonstrate the performance of SVMs and compares SVMs to other traditional classification/regression methods""--  ""Support vector machines (SVMs) seem a very promising kernel-based machine learning method originally developed for pattern recognition and later extended to multivariate regression. What distinguishes SVMs from traditional learning methods lies in its exclusive objective function, which minimizes the structural risk of the model. The introduction of the kernel function into SVMs made it extremely attractive, since it opens a new door for chemists/biologists to use SVMs to solve difficult nonlinear problems in chemistry and biotechnology through the simple linear transformation technique. The distinctive features and excellent empirical performances of SVMs have drawn the eyes of chemists and biologists so much that a number of papers, mainly concerned with the applications of SVMs, have been published in chemistry and biotechnology in recent years. These applications cover a large scope of chemical and/or biological meaningful problems, e.g. spectral calibration, drug design, quantitative structure-activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR), food quality control, chemical reaction monitoring, metabolic fingerprint analysis, protein structure and function prediction, microarray data-based cancer classification and so on. However, in order to efficiently apply this rather new technique to solve difficult problems in chemistry and biotechnology, one should have a sound in-depth understanding of what kind information this new mathematical tool could really provide and what its statistic property is. This book aims at giving a deeper and more thorough description of the mechanism of SVMs from the point of view of chemists/biologists and hence to make it easy for chemists and biologists to understand""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book provides a self-contained and rigorous account on the fundamentals and applications of the subject to chemical physics, assuming no prior knowledge of group theory. The first half of the book focuses on elementary topics, such as molecular and crystal symmetry, whilst the latter half is more advanced in nature. Discussions on more complex material such as space groups, projective representations, magnetic crystals and spinor bases, often omitted from introductory texts, is expertly dealt with. With the inclusion of numerous exercises and worked examples, this book will appeal to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students studying physical sciences and is an ideal text for use on a two-semester course.

The theory of nonlinear complex systems has become a successful problem-solving approach in the natural sciences from laser physics, quantum chaos, and meteorology to computer simulations of cell growth in biology. It is now recognized that many of our social, economic, ecological, and political problems are also of a global, complex, and nonlinear nature. And one of the most exciting contemporary topics is the idea that even the human mind is governed largely by the nonlinear dynamics of complex systems. Professor Mainzer, president of the German Society of Complex Systems and Nonlinear Dynamics, discusses, in a nontechnical language, the common framework behind these endeavors. The extended edition also analyzes the new applications of complex systems to materials science, nanotechnology, and artificial life.

It is a valuable tool for astrophysicists as well. The first chapters treat the basic principles of quantum and statistical mechanics and how to derive thermophysical properties from them. Special topics are included that are rarely found in other textbooks, such as the thermophysical and transport properties of multi-temperature gases and a novel method to compute radiative transfer. Furthermore, collision processes between different particles are discussed. Separate chapters deal with the production of high-temperature gases and with electrical emission in plasmas, as well as related diagnostic techniques.
