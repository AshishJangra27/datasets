Specifically, it examines how individual wills translate into political ideologies, investigates what social forces converge to shape governmental operations, and probes whether human polity progresses in focus from individual wills to group interests to social integrations. The book entertains five hypotheses. The first is commonsensical: where there are people there is politics. The second is analogous: humans govern themselves socially in a way that is comparable to how a body regulates itself physically. Th.

The history of the American electorate is not a litany of flukes; instead it is a pattern of tectonic plate-grinding, punctuated by a landscape-altering earthquake every generation or so. Donald Trump's electoral coalition is smashing both American political parties and its previously impenetrable political news media.The political experts called the 2016 election wrong and in the wake of the 2016 election surprise, the experts have continued to blow it - looking to predict the coming demise of the President without pausing to consider the durability of the trends and winds that swept him into office. The Great Revolt delves deep into the minds and hearts of the voters the make up this coalition. What emerges is a group of citizens who cannot be described by terms like ""angry,"" ""male,"" ""rural,"" or the often-used ""racist."" They span job descriptions, income brackets, education levels, and party allegiances. What unites them is their desire to be part of a movement larger than themselves that puts pragmatism before ideology, localism before globalism, and demands the respect it deserve from Washington. Zito and Todd have traveled on over 27,000 miles of country roads to interview more than 300 Trump voters in 10 swing counties. What they have discovered is that these voters were hiding in plain sight--ignored by both parties, the media, and the political experts all at once, ready to unite into the movement that spawned the greatest upset in recent electoral history. Deeply rooted in the culture of these Midwestern swing states, Zito and Brad Todd reframe the discussion of the ""Trump voter"" to answer the question: What next?""--  ""The history of the American electorate is not a litany of flukes; instead it is a pattern of tectonic plate-grinding, punctuated by a landscape-altering earthquake every generation or so.

The religious right is on the defensive, acceptance of gay rights is at an all-time high, social conservatives are struggling for relevance, and more Americans than ever identify as nonreligious. What does this mean for the country and the future? With these demographic shifts, can truly progressive, reason-based public policy finally gain traction? Or will America continue to carry a reputation as anti-intellectual and plutocratic, eager to cater to large corporate interests but reluctant to provide universal health care to all its citizens? Fighting Back the Right reveals a new alliance in the making, a progressive coalition committed to fighting for rational public policy in America and reversing the damage inflicted by decades of conservative dominance. David Niose, Legal Director of the American Humanist Association (AHA), examines this exciting new dynamic, covering not only the rapidly evolving culture wars but also the twists and turns of American history and politics that led to this point, and why this new alliance could potentially move the country in a direction of sanity, fairness, and human-centered public policy""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Realpolitik,John Bew,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20014997W,/authors/OL4268700A/John_Bew,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL30593828M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 395,"""Realpolitik is approaching its 160th birthday, though it has existed as a form of statecraft for centuries and is arguably as old as the conduct of foreign affairs itself. Associated with great thinkers from Machiavelli to Kissinger, it is deeply rooted in the history of diplomacy yet also remains strikingly relevant to debates on contemporary foreign policy in the Obama administration today. Despite the fact that Realpolitik has had something of a renaissance in recent years, however, it remains a surprisingly elusive notion, defying easy categorization. In this concise book, John Bew aims to address this gap, offering a history of the concept of Realpolitik in the English-speaking world: its origins as an idea; its practical application to statecraft in the recent past; and its relevance to the foreign policy challenges facing the United States and its allies in the future. Now most often associated with the conduct of foreign policy, Realpolitik has traditionally had pejorative connotations in the English-speaking world and sits uneasily alongside notions of ""enlightenment,"" ""morality"" and ""virtue."" But it has also had its defenders, admirers and exponents, who regard it as the best tool for the successful wielding of political power and the preservation of global order. As such, Realpolitik has both successes and failures to its name, as Bew's comprehensive and even-handed overview displays. Bew begins by charting the evolution of the idea through the work of important thinkers or statesmen from Machiavelli, Cardinal de Richelieu, and Thomas Hobbes up through Carl Schmitt, Kissinger, and Dennis Ross. He then examines how Realpolitik has been evoked and operationalized in US and UK foreign policy during specific episodes in the twentieth century, looking at such cases as the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, and President Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 - often taken as the archetypal instance of Realpolitik in action. Bew then uses this historical platform to look forward to emerging foreign policy challenges in a changing, multi-polar, geo-political scene - in which Realpolitik and agile statecraft seems as important as ever. Suggesting that there is a uniquely Anglo-American version of Realpolitik, which reflects an attempt (not always a successful one) to reconcile Western ideological and moral norms with purely utilitarian conceptions of the national interest, Bew argues that a more accurate and sustainable version of Anglo-American Realpolitik is one that recognizes the draw Enlightenment values and ideas. Directed at a broader audience of current policy-makers, legislators and commentators with an interest in foreign affairs, this is a brilliant introduction to an important topic from one of the field's rising stars""--  ""In this concise book, John Bew offers a history of the concept of Realpolitik in the English-speaking world: its origins as an idea; its practical application to statecraft in the recent past; and its relevance to the foreign policy challenges facing the United States and its allies in the future.

Defending white democracy,Jason Morgan Ward,political_science,First published in 2011,/works/OL15936609W,/authors/OL6941893A/Jason_Morgan_Ward,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  The University of North Carolina Press|Language English,"""After the Supreme Court ruled school segregation unconstitutional in 1954, southern white backlash seemed to explode overnight. Journalists profiled the rise of a segregationist movement committed to preserving the ""southern way of life"" through a campaign of massive resistance. In Defending White Democracy, Jason Morgan Ward reconsiders the origins of this white resistance, arguing that southern conservatives began mobilizing against civil rights some years earlier, in the era before World War II, when the New Deal politics of the mid-1930s threatened the monopoly on power that whites held in the South.  As Ward shows, years before ""segregationist"" became a badge of honor for civil rights opponents, many white southerners resisted racial change at every turn--launching a preemptive campaign aimed at preserving a social order that they saw as under siege. By the time of the Brown decision, segregationists had amassed an arsenal of tested tactics and arguments to deploy against the civil rights movement in the coming battles. Connecting the racial controversies of the New Deal era to the more familiar confrontations of the 1950s and 1960s, Ward uncovers a parallel history of segregationist opposition that mirrors the new focus on the long civil rights movement and raises troubling questions about the enduring influence of segregation's defenders.

This seasoned observer of political and diplomatic worlds shatters the myth of the inevitability of sectarian conflict and that the diplomacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran is exhausted. Instead, Banafsheh Keynoush argues in Saudi Arabia and Iran: Friends or Foes? that it has yet to be explored, by recasting the partnership from a US-centered point of view to one based on how Saudi Arabia and Iran see their roles. Who is to blame and how to fix it is part of this penetrating historic account which captivates readers through accurate, non-sensational, and objective analysis. Keynoush recounts it all: the fears, misunderstandings, prejudices, and ambitions that have hobbled efforts to build a lasting partnership, creating a work that is important to both the expert and the layperson. ""--  ""The mesmerizing story of two countries caught in history whose rivalry can destroy the world or restore its peace, this is the first book to untangle the complex relationship of Saudi Arabia and Iran by rejecting heated rhetoric and looking at the real roots of the issue to promise pathways to peace""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Corinne T. Field argues that attaining adulthood--and the associated political rights, economic opportunities, and sexual power that come with it--became a common goal for both white and African American feminists between the American Revolution and the Civil War. The idea that black men and all women were more like children than adult white men proved difficult to overcome, however, and continued to serve as a foundation for racial and sexual inequality for generations. In detailing the connections between the struggle for equality and concepts of adulthood, Field provides an essential historical context for understanding the dilemmas black and white women still face in America today, from ""glass ceilings"" and debates over welfare dependency to a culture obsessed with youth and beauty. Drawn from a fascinating past, this book tells the history of how maturity, gender, and race collided, and how those affected came together to fight against injustice.

How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,Jason Stanley,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL17929883W,/authors/OL2669375A/Jason_Stanley,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26501972M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Random House|Language English|Pages 218,"As the child of refugees of World War II Europe and a renowned philosopher and scholar of propaganda, Jason Stanley has a deep understanding of how democratic societies can be vulnerable to fascism: Nations don’t have to be fascist to suffer from fascist politics. In fact, fascism’s roots have been present in the United States for more than a century. Alarmed by the pervasive rise of fascist tactics both at home and around the globe, Stanley focuses here on the structures that unite them, laying out and analyzing the ten pillars of fascist politics—the language and beliefs that separate people into an “us” and a “them.” He knits together reflections on history, philosophy, sociology, and critical race theory with stories from contemporary Hungary, Poland, India, Myanmar, and the United States, among other nations. He makes clear the immense danger of underestimating the cumulative power of these tactics, which include exploiting a mythic version of a nation’s past; propaganda that twists the language of democratic ideals against themselves; anti-intellectualism directed against universities and experts; law and order politics predicated on the assumption that members of minority groups are criminals; and fierce attacks on labor groups and welfare. These mechanisms all build on one another, creating and reinforcing divisions and shaping a society  By uncovering disturbing patterns that are as prevalent today as ever, Stanley reveals that the stuff of politics—charged by rhetoric and myth—can quickly become policy and reality. Only by recognizing fascists politics, he argues, may we resist its most harmful effects and return to democratic ideals.   Read more Read less",37 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

Designing Disorder: Experiments and Disruptions in the City,Richard Sennett,political_science,First published in 2020,/works/OL20687620W,/authors/OL224003A/Richard_Sennett,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27972390M-M.jpg,"Publish Date Apr 29, 2021|Publisher  Alianza Editorial|Language Spanish|Pages 232","Acosados por la privatización, la planificación urbanística obsesiva, la vigilancia policial y la especulación, los espacios que habitamos se vuelven cada vez más inhóspitos, recipientes cerrados que coartan la acción y limitan la experiencia vibrante que constituía la riqueza humana de las grandes ciudades.  Cincuenta años después de la publicación de su clásico Los usos del desorden, en el que Richard Sennett alertó por primera vez sobre los efectos nocivos que la proyección de modelos preconcebidos y rígidos sobre el entorno urbano tenía sobre aquellos a los que pretendían cobijar, Sennett vuelve junto con Pablo Sendra a las tesis que guiaron este título fundamental: a saber, que la idea de un espacio urbano ordenado y planificado constituía una trampa que llevaba en su seno la semilla de la corrupción de la vida de las ciudades, y que la existencia de una cierta forma de desorden era un requisito ineludible para la gestación de una ciudadanía crítica y emancipada.  A través de lo que sus autores denominan «infraestructuras para el desorden», estas páginas plantean la urgencia de diseñar nuevas formas de intervenir en el tejido urbano que, combinando la arquitectura, la política, el urbanismo y el activismo comunitario, posibiliten los tipos de desorden que puedan generar una ciudad abierta constituida por individuos autónomos, libres y comprometidos. Espacios, en definitiva, capaces de reunir en lugar de dividir, de generar, en lugar de osificar: espacios abiertos al cambio y a la transformación radical.

Racial Barrier Falls in Heavy Turnout."" But new events quickly muted the exuberant declarations of a postracial era in America: from claims that Obama was born in Kenya and that he is not a true American, to depictions of Obama as a ""Lyin African"" and conservative cartoons that showed the new president surrounded by racist stereotypes like watermelons and fried chicken. Despite the utopian proclamations that we are now live in a color-blind, postracial country, the grim reality is that implicit racial biases are more entrenched than ever. In Wrongs of the Right, Matthew W. Hughey and Gregory S. Parks set postracial claims into relief against a background of pre- and post-election racial animus directed at Obama, his administration, and African Americans. They provide an analysis of the political Right and their opposition to Obama from the vantage point of their rhetoric, a history of the evolution of the two-party system in relation to race, social scientific research on race and political ideology, and how racial fears, coded language, and implicit racism are drawn upon and manipulated by the political Right. Racial meanings are reservoirs rich in political currency, and the Right's replaying of the race card remains a potent resource for othering the first black president in a context rife with Nativism, xenophobia, white racial fatigue, and serious racial inequality. And as Hughey and Parks show, race trumps politics and policies when it comes to political conservatives' hostility toward Obama""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Written by an international team of contributors, the book features case studies from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, North America, and Asia. Each chapter is written to a common research template examining the national social and political context, the purpose of the vigilante group, how it is organised and operates, its communications and social media strategy and its relationship to mainstream social actors and institutions, and to similar groups in other countries. The final comparative chapter explores some of the broader research issues such as under which conditions such vigiliantism emerges, flourishes or fails, policing approaches, masculinity, the role of social media, responses from the state and civil society, and the evidence of transnational co-operation or inspiration. This is a groundbreaking volume which will be of particular interest to scholars with an interest in the extreme right, social movements, political violence, policing and criminology.

In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his friends are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they are brutally interrogated for days.  When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has become a police state. He knows that no one will believe him, which leaves him one option: to take down the DHS himself. Can one brilliant teenage hacker actually fight back? Maybe, but only if he’s very careful...and if he chooses his friends well.  Homeland  A few years after the events of Little Brother, California’s economy collapses and Marcus finds himself employed by a crusading politician who promises reform. Then his former nemesis, Masha, emerges with a thumbdrive containing WikiLeaks-style evidence of government wrongdoing. When Marcus witnesses Masha’s kidnapping by the same agents who detained and tortured him earlier, he has to decide whether to save her or leak the archive that will cost his employer the election and put thousands at risk.  Surrounded by friends who consider him a hacker hero, stalked by people who look like they’re used to inflicting pain, Marcus has to act, and act fast.

This is especially true with regard to the Trump presidency. It has become difficult to have a reasonable discussion about the most controversial president in our recent history. For Trump zealots, their president has not only committed no crimes, he has done nothing wrong. For anti-Trump zealots, nothing Trump has done--even in foreign policy--is good. Everything he has done is wrong, and since it is wrong, it must necessarily be criminal. This deeply undemocratic fallacy--that political sins must be investigated and prosecuted as criminal--is an exceedingly dangerous trend. Hardening positions on both sides has been manifested by increasing demands to criminalize political differences. Both sides scream ""lock 'em up"" instead of making substantive criticisms of opposing views... The vibrant center is weakening, with traditional liberalism and conservatism becoming further apart, not just in approach, but in their respect for Constitutional norms that have served us well for more than two centuries. While Donald Trump is not the only cause of this profound division, his election drew it to the surface and made it the dominant paradigm of political debate. Unless we as a nation begin to focus again on what unites us rather than on what divides us, America might not survive the next decade.""--Publisher description.

Im Mittelpunkt der Überlegungen stehen dabei programmatische und organisatorische Planungsprobleme sowie ihre Interdependenzen. Unter diesen Aspekten interessieren vor allem die Integration der finanziellen Planungen mit einer Aufgabenplanung, deren inhaltliche und organisatorische Verzahnung mit einer Erfolgskontrolle bzw.

Mike Lofgren is back with a book perfectly pitched for the frenzied circus of the primaries. His argument this time is that for all of the backstabbing and money grubbing of the campaign season, the politicians we elect have as little ability to shift policy as Communist party apparatchiks. Welcome to Mike Lofgren's Washington, D.C.--a This Town, where the political theater that is endlessly tweeted and blogged about has nothing to do with actual decision making. The real work gets done behind the scenes by invisible bureaucrats working for the vast web of agencies that actually dictate our foreign policy, defense posture, and security decisions. Have you ever wondered why Obama's policies look so much like Bush's? Seek no further: Hillary v. Jeb is just window dressing. Actual power lies in the Deep State, Washington's shadowy power elite, in the pockets of corporate interests and dependent on the moguls of Silicon Valley, whose data-collecting systems enable the U.S. government to spy on our every move, swipe, and click. Drawing on insider knowledge gleaned in his three decades on the Hill, Lofgren offers a provocative wake-up call to Americans and urges them to fight to reinstate the basic premise of the Constitution""--  ""An acerbic, no holds barred indictment of business as usual in Washington, DC--where our elected leaders provide a fig leaf for those who really hold the levers of power--by a 28-year veteran of the Hill, the bestselling author of The Party Is Over Have you ever noticed that behind all the mud-slinging and invective there isn't much difference between the parties? For all of his big talk and promises of change, Obama is basically Bush lite. And Hillary--or Jeb--will be more of the same. We spend ten times more on the political circus leading up to elections than any other country, but what are we getting for all of that money? The truth, as Mike Lofgren reveals in this devastating takedown of beltway business, is that our elected leaders provide a fig leaf for those who really hold the levers of power, the unelected functionaries of our ever-growing bureaucracies who decide America's defense, intelligence, and foreign policy and the corporate titans who control them. If it sounds like House of Cards it's because there is more truth to that than you might care to believe. Mike Lofgren draws on his three decades on the Hill to take you behind the scenes and map out where ower is really held in Washington, in the bowels of what he calls ""the deep state.""""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is a contribution to the historiography of the post-war transformation of the French intellectual and political landscape and sheds light upon the intellectual origins and evolution of modern French humanitarianism. Covering a period of major international upheavals and domestic transformation in France, it underlines the powerful legacy of Cold War politics for international affairs since the fall of the Iron Curtain. It was joint recipient of the International Studies Association Ethics Section Book Prize (2017).

The destiny of the republic,Candice Millard,political_science,First published in 2011,/works/OL16175517W?edition=ia%3Adestinyrepublict00mill_875,/authors/OL1434583A/Candice_Millard,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25053511M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Doubleday|Language English|Pages 366,"James A. Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will, he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration, a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back. But the shot didn't kill Garfield. The drama of what happened subsequently is a powerful story of a nation in turmoil. The unhinged assassin's half-delivered strike shattered the fragile national mood of a country so recently fractured by civil war, and left the wounded president as the object of a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle for power—over his administration, over the nation's future, and, hauntingly, over his medical care. A team of physicians administered shockingly archaic treatments, to disastrous effect. As his condition worsened, Garfield received help: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, worked around the clock to invent a new device capable of finding the bullet. Meticulously researched, epic in scope, and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive, The Destiny of the Republic will stand alongside The Devil in the White City and The Professor and the Madman as a classic of narrative history. - Publisher.

How is AI shaping our understanding of ourselves and our societies? In this book Kate Crawford reveals how this planetary network is fueling a shift toward undemocratic governance and increased inequality. Drawing on more than a decade of research, award-winning science, and technology, Crawford reveals how AI is a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers behind ""automated"" services, to the data AI collects from us.    Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms, Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong. While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity, they are always systems of power. This is an urgent account of what is at stake as technology companies use artificial intelligence to reshape the world.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Uh-oh. Congress buys onto the idea and Reyes is sucked into the mother of all reality shows, The President Factor. As Reyes and his Republican counterpart tackle the challenges, the TV networks go about misusing the show's footage to satisfy their own political agendas, the slanted cable talk shows ratchet it up a notch and the current president spies on the team from the opposite party. Kinda like business as usual in DC today. Will the charismatic Hispanic candidate win? Why is one team getting malaria shots? Can Washington politics be even more absurd? Yes...to the last question.

Depending on their integration patterns, migrants could become allies of substate nationalists or could instead buttress the statewide majority and undermine substate autonomy claims. Grounded in extensive archival and interview-based research, this comparative study asks how political leaders in Quebec, Flanders and Brussels, and Scotland have responded to immigration, migrant integration and diversity, and what shapes their policy approaches over time. Barker shows that institutional and power configurations of the multilevel state, leaders' perceptions of how immigration impacts on national autonomy goals, and dynamics of competitive nation-building all shape substate responses to immigration and migrants. Barker offers a new dimension to scholarship on immigration by examining policy responses among substate nationalists and in societies already possessing deep diversity. Nationalism, Identity and the Governance of Diversity also explores the implications of political decentralization for how multilevel, multinational democracies govern diversity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a result, argues Mark Lilla in this timely book, the ideas and passions that shape today's political dramas are unintelligible to us. The reactionary is anything but a conservative. He is as radical and modern a figure as the revolutionary, someone shipwrecked in the rapidly changing present, and suffering from nostalgia for an idealized past and an apocalyptic fear that history is rushing toward catastrophe. And like the revolutionary his political engagements are motived by highly developed ideas. Lilla unveils the structure of reactionary thinking, beginning with three twentieth-century philosophers--Franz Rosenzweig, Eric Voegelin, and Leo Strauss --who attributed the problems of modern society to a break in the history of ideas and promoted a return to earlier modes of thought. He then examines the enduring power of grand historical narratives of betrayal to shape political outlooks ever since the French Revolution. These narratives are employed to serve different, and sometimes expressly opposed, ends. They appear in the writings of Europe's right-wing cultural pessimists and Maoist neocommunists, American theoconservatives fantasizing about the harmony of medieval Catholic society and radical Islamists seeking to restore a vanished Muslim caliphate. The revolutionary spirit that inspired political movements across the world for two centuries may have died out. But the spirit of reaction that rose to meet it has survived and is proving just as formidable a historical force. We live in an age when the tragicomic nostalgia of Don Quixote for a lost golden age has been transformed into a potent and sometimes deadly weapon. Mark Lilla helps us to understand why""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a result of this, the globalized Arctic has a high level of peace and stability, maintained by international cooperation between the Arctic states, northern indigenous peoples, sub-national governments and local actors. There has also been a shift from environmental protection to economic activities and, consequently, states easily trump other interests. Now, in the Arctic, these challenges require fresh thinking on a local and global scale. Regional wars, the 'war on terror', and economic crises have posed new threats to Northern security order.

The dynamism of planet Earth is especially well illustrated by the changes that have occured during the past 3 million years; during this period, cycles of climatic change have been dominant, involving fluctuations in global temperatures by as much as 10 degrees celcius, and including warm episodes similar to those of the last ten thousand years. In order to predict and manage future change caused by both natural and human agencies, contemporary research is focusing on archives of environmental data and on the response of environmental components. Natural Environmental Change offers a concise introduction to this key topic in the study of the environment, geography, and earth science. Illustrated throughout, each chapter provides a broad spectrum of international case studies from diverse regions along with guides to further reading.Introductory chapters examine theories developed to explain environmental change, and provide a summary of Earth history. The records of environmental change are then explained, as revealed by data from various archives such as ocean sediments, ice cores, terrestrial deposits (such as glacial moraines and lake sediments), tree rings, and historical and meteorological records. Final chapters detail the changes that have occured in high, middle and low latitudes, and the book concludes with a critical assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current understanding. The extensive bibliography will also prove invaluable to those pursuing courses covering environmental change.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Along with John Rawls's A Theory of Justice (1971), it is widely credited with breathing new life into the discipline in the second half of the twentieth century. This Companion presents a balanced and comprehensive assessment of Nozick's contribution to political philosophy. In engaging and accessible chapters, the contributors analyse Nozick's ideas from a variety of perspectives and explore neglected areas of the work such as his discussion of anarchism and his theory of utopia. Their detailed and illuminating picture of Anarchy, State, and Utopia, its impact and its enduring influence will be invaluable to students and scholars in both political philosophy and political theory""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, no one book has dealt with the wide range of protests nor with the terminology associated with the state and police response to it. This dictionary explores a variety of issues related to the policing of public order, protest and political violence providing a comprehensive overview of international protest since 1945. It defines the key terms associated with these activities and, through the use of a number of international case studies, it includes numerous examples of protest and dissent that have taken place across the world, and the groups and organisations which have utilized these forms of political expression.Written in an accessible style, each entry is accompanied by a list of sources and suggestions for further reading through which readers can extend their knowledge of each of the topics. This unique and in-depth resource will be an essential guide for scholars across Criminology, Criminal Justice, Policing, Political History and International Relations.

Employing numerous examples, Brian Campbell explores the development of the Roman army and the expansion of the Roman Empire from 31 BC-280 AD.When Augustus established a permanent, professional army, this implied a role for the Emperor as a military leader. Warfare and Society in Imperial Rome examines this personal association between army and emperor, and argues that the Emperor's position as commander remained much the same for the next 200 years.Dealing with issues such as the financial implications of supporting a professional army in war and peace, Brian Campbell explores the wider significance of the army and warfare in Roman life and culture.

Anarchism and Eugenics,Richard Cleminson,political_science,First published in 2019,/works/OL21207280W,/authors/OL2774826A/Richard_Cleminson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28719502M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Manchester University Press|Language English|Pages 240,"This book focuses on the apparently surprising convergence between anarchism and eugenics. By tracing the reception of eugenic ideas within five different anarchist movements –Argentina, England, France, Portugal and Spain – the book argues that, in fact, there is ample evidence for anarchist interest in, and implementation of, some form of eugenics. The author argues that this intersection between anarchism and eugenics can be understood as an emanation from anarchism’s nineteenth-century legacy, which harnessed science as a means to change the social world and an ideological commitment to voluntarism as a political praxis. Through the articulation of interest in birth control, ‘neo-Malthusianism’, freedom to choose for women and revolutionary objectives, many anarchists across these five countries provided the basis for the creation of ‘anarchist eugenics’ in the early twentieth century.

Having lived for two decades under a liberal democracy, however, he has discovered that these two political systems have a lot more in common than one might think. They both stem from the same historical roots in early modernity, and accept similar presuppositions about history, society, religion, politics, culture, and human nature.     In The Demon in Democracy, Legutko explores the shared objectives between these two political systems, and explains how liberal democracy has over time lurched towards the same goals as communism, albeit without Soviet style brutalality.     Both systems, says Legutko, reduce human nature to that of the common man, who is led to believe himself liberated from the obligations of the past. Both the communist man and the liberal democratic man refuse to admit that there exists anything of value outside the political systems to which they pledged their loyalty. And both systems refuse to undertake any critical examination of their ideological prejudices.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wie ist dieser »ethical turn« zu beurteilen? Wie gelangen die Wissenschaftler von einer behaupteten Grundlosigkeit zu Gründen für die Demokratie?  Luzia Sievi liefert eine detaillierte Analyse sowohl zu den Kritiken an der Demokratie als auch zu den Demokratieentwürfen der genannten Denker – und zeigt, welche Werte und Erkenntnisse bewirken, dass aus scharfen Kritikern starke Verfechter der Demokratie werden.

Taking care to discuss not only the main academic theories of the discipline, he also brings to light the practical problems and issues confronting the field today, and later examines the important role of organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union, as well as the influence of ethnic and religious movements and terrorist groups in shaping the way states interact.

Key thinkers who include Foucault, Baudrillard and Lyotard have challenged existing ideas about power and rationality in society. One area that has been largely immune to such developments has been urban planning.This book analyses planning from a postmodern perpective and explores alternative conceptions based on a combination of postmodern thinking and other fields of social theory. In doing so, it exposes some of the limits of postmodern social theory while providing an alternative conception of planning in the twenty-first century.This title will appeal to anyone interested in how we think and act in relation to cities, urban planning and governance.

The third chapter focuses on the world income distribution and resulting implications for poverty reduction, pro-poor growth and the evolution of global inequality. The fourth chapter estimates the welfare effects of recently negotiated Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and African countries.

Although they may disavow politics as such, civic-minded young people use every means and media at their disposal to carry out the basic tasks of citizenship. Through a mix of face-to-face and digital methods, they deliberate on important issues and debate with peers and powerbrokers, redefining some key dynamics that govern civic life in the process. In Participatory Politics, Elisabeth Soep examines the specific tactics used by young people as they experiment with civic engagement.Drawing on her scholarly research and on her work as a media producer and educator, Soep identifies five tactics that are part of effective, equitable participatory politics among young people: Pivot Your Public (mobilizing civic capacity within popular culture engagements); Create Content Worlds (using inventive and interactive storytelling that sparks sharing); Forage for Information in public data archives; Code Up (using computational thinking to design tools, platforms, and spaces for public good); and Hide and Seek (protecting privacy and information sources). After describing these tactics as they manifest themselves in a range of youth-driven activities?from the runaway spread of the video Kony 2012 to community hackathons?Soep discusses concrete ideas for cultivating the new literacies that will enable young people to participate in public life. She goes on to consider some risks associated with these participatory tactics, including simplification and sensationalism, and ways to avoid them, and concludes with implications for future research and practice.

Um diesen Defiziten begegnen zu können, wird der Versuch eines theoretischen Gegenentwurfs unternommen, der vor allem auf dem methodischen Ansatz der Österreichischen Schule fußt. Das Erklärungspotential dieses praxeologisch-eigentumsrechtlichen Theorieansatzes wird am Beispiel der Transformation des Wirtschaftssystems in Russland demonstriert. Es zeigt sich, dass nicht die sogenannte Privatisierung bestehender Unternehmensstrukturen, sondern die ungehinderte Schaffung neuer Unternehmen eine Lösung der Transformationskrise verspricht.

Contemporary cosmopolitanism,Angela Taraborrelli,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL23202450W,/authors/OL6136332A/Angela_Taraborrelli,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Bloomsbury Academic|Language English,"""Contemporary Cosmopolitanism is the first, much-needed, introduction to contemporary political cosmopolitanism. Although it has its roots in classical philosophy and politics, Cosmopolitanism has undergone a major revival in the last forty years,  stirring far-reaching and intense international debates.Cosmopolitanism is a way of thought and life which entails an  identification of the individual with the whole humankind, and implies a  moral obligation to promote social and political justice at the global  level.  Contemporary cosmopolitanism reflects a global state that is  already in itself highly cosmopolitan, and represents an attempt to  solve the new problems raised by this situation, to reappraise a number  of traditional conceptual categories in the light of changes having  already occurred or that are still taking place, to develop new ones, as  well as to encourage and guide political-institutional reform projects.Taraborrelli provides clear descriptions of the three main forms of contemporary cosmopolitanism - moral, political-legal and cultural - described through the thought of various figures representative of the more significant approaches: Appiah, Archibugi, Beitz, Benhabib, Bhabha, Held, Kaldor, Nussbaum, Pogge, Sousa Santos. This book provides a sound and comprehensive basis for the study of cosmopolitanism, ideal as a starting point for the discussion of issues of widespread interest such as human rights, global justice, migration, multiculturalism""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Liberal Democracy,Max Meyer,political_science,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501345W,/authors/OL1879957A/Max_Meyer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Springer Nature|Pages 74,"This open access book aims to show which factors have been decisive in the rise of successful countries. Never before have so many people been so well off. However, prosperity is not a law of nature; it has to be worked for. A liberal economy stands at the forefront of this success – not as a political system, but as a set of economic rules promoting competition, which in turn leads to innovation, research and enormous productivity. Sustainable prosperity is built on a foundation of freedom, equal opportunity and a functioning government. This requires a stable democracy that cannot be defeated by an autocrat. Autocrats claim that “illiberalism” is more efficient, an assertion that justifies their own power. Although autocrats can efficiently guide the first steps out of poverty, once a certain level of prosperity has been achieved, people begin to demand a sense of well-being – freedom and codetermination. Only when this is possible will they feel comfortable, and progress will continue. Respect for human rights is crucial. The rules of the free market do not lean to either the right or left politically. Liberalism and the welfare state are not mutually exclusive. The “conflict” concerns the amount of government intervention. Should there be more or less? As a lawyer, entrepreneur, and board member with over 40 years of experience in this field of conflict, the author clearly describes the conditions necessary for a country to maintain its position at the top.

Social Democratic Parties and the Working Class,Line Rennwald,political_science,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501384W,/authors/OL5861506A/Line_Rennwald,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Springer International Publishing AG|Language English,"This open access book carefully explores the relationship between social democracy and its working-class electorate in Western Europe. Relying on different indicators, it demonstrates an important transformation in the class basis of social democracy. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the working-class vote is strongly fragmented and social democratic parties face competition on multiple fronts for their core electorate – and not only from radical right parties. Starting from a reflection on ‘working-class parties’ and using a sophisticated class schema, the book paints a nuanced and diversified picture of the trajectory of social democracy that goes beyond a simple shift from working-class to middle-class parties. Following a detailed description, the book reviews possible explanations of workers' new voting patterns and emphasizes the crucial changes in parties' ideologies. It closes with a discussion on the role of the working class in social democracy's future electoral strategies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, much remains to be done to achieve fully consolidated democratic states. This study documents the weaknesses of public oversight and participation in policymaking in Hungary and Poland, two of the most advanced countries in the region. It discusses five alternative routes to accountability including European Union oversight, constitutional institutions such as presidents and courts, devolution to lower-level governments, the use of neo-corporatist bodies, and open-ended participation rights. It urges more emphasis on the fifth option, public participation. Case studies of the environmental movement in Hungary and of student groups in Poland illustrate these general points. The book reviews the United States' experience of open-ended public participation and draws some lessons for the transition countries from the strengths and weaknesses of the American system.

In Village of Immigrants, Diana R. Gordon illustrates how small-town America has been revitalized by the arrival of these newcomers in Greenport, where she lives. Greenport today boasts a population that is one-third Hispanic. Gordon contends that these immigrants have effectively saved the town's economy by taking low-skill jobs, increasing the tax base, filling schools, and creating and patronizing local businesses. Greenport's seaside beauty still attracts summer tourists, but it is only with the support of the local Latino workforce that elegant restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts are able to serve these visitors. For Gordon the picture is complex, because the wave of immigrants also presents the town with challenges to its services and institutions. Gordon's portraits of local immigrants capture the positive and the negative, with a cast of characters ranging from a Guatemalan mother of three, including one child who is profoundly disabled, to a Colombian house painter with a successful business who cannot become licensed because he remains undocumented. Village of Immigrants weaves together these people's stories, fears, and dreams to reveal an environment plagued by threats of deportation, debts owed to coyotes, low wages, and the other bleak realities that shape the immigrant experience--even in the charming seaport village of Greenport. A timely contribution to the national dialogue on immigration, Gordon's book shows the pivotal role the American small town plays in the ongoing American immigrant story--as well as how this booming population is shaping and reviving rural communities""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book explores the work of ten diplomats who were charged with negotiating conclusions to intractable conflicts in the Middle East and Balkans. The first study to combine the outlooks of practitioners and academics, Ways out of War shows how peacemaking has struggled to respond to new forms of war, especially asymmetrical warfare between state and non-state actors. It shows these diplomats straining to solve major challenges, such as negotiating with war criminals, balancing peace against justice, handling spoilers, setting the timing of peace initiatives, and building or rebuilding state structures. By focusing on these questions from individual peacemakers' points of view, Ways out of War paints a vivid picture of peacemaking, one with full scope for the play of personalities--but one, too, that is critical, comparative, and fully informed by theoretical literature. It will make compelling and essential reading for all students of negotiation and conflict resolution, as well as for any reader who takes an interest in the Balkans, the Middle East, or the ten notable diplomats at its heart""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""During the week of October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was decisively ahead of Donald Trump in most polls. Then FBI Director James Comey sent his infamous letter to Congress on October 28, saying the bureau was investigating additional emails potentially relevant to the Hillary Clinton email case. Lost in the immediate media firestorm was any thoughtful analysis of the long, complex--and in many ways, hidden--narrative that brought Comey to this irreversible moment. Now, in this losely reasoned account, Lanny J. Davis shows how Comey's misguided announcement swung a significant number of voters away from Clinton, winning Trump an Electoral College victory--and the presidency. Drawing on sources in the intelligence community and Justice Department, Davis challenges Comey's legal rationale for opening a criminal investigation of Clinton's email practices, questions whether Comey received sufficient Justice Department oversight, and cites the odd clairvoyance of Trump ally Rudolph Giuliani, who publicly predicted an ""October surprise"" was coming. Davis then proves, state by state, using authoritative polling data, how voter support for Clinton dropped after the Comey letter was made public, especially in key battleground states. Despite so many other issues in the election--Trump's behavior, the Russian hacking, Clinton's campaign missteps--after the October 28 Comey letter, everything changed. American history took a surprising turn. In his final chapter, Davis makes a strong case that an impeachment investigation of President Trump must be begun by the U.S. House of Representatives and that serious consideration should also be given to removal of Trump under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment in light of evidence of mental instability that raises the question whether he can safely discharge his duties and powers as President.""--Dust jacket.

Su obra capital, El espíritu de las leyes, sigue recordándonos la necesidad de oponer al despotismo, la esclavitud y la excesiva severidad de las leyes, la separación de poderes, el empeño por preservar una libertad responsable y la búsqueda de la felicidad personal, frente al despotismo, la esclavitud y la excesiva severidad de las leyes, entre otros atentados a la condición humana. Carmen Iglesias sitúa el pensamiento de Montesquieu en el amplio contexto de la filosofía, la ciencia y la medicina de su tiempo y lo empuja a entablar un diálogo profundo con Descartes, Newton, Spinoza o Leibniz, con el propósito de que nos percatemos no solo de su amplitud, sino también de su indiscutible actualidad.

Im Rahmen einer positiven Wirkungsanalyse wird untersucht, wie sich die Individuen an gegebene Kredithilfeprogramme anpassen und welche allokativen und distributiven Konsequenzen daraus resultieren. Um die Entscheidung zugunsten öffentlicher Kredithilfen als Subventionsform und deren verbreitete Realisierung außerhalb des Budgets zu erklären, wird der politische Prozeß in die weitere Analyse einbezogen. Dabei wird insbesondere diskutiert, inwieweit einzelne Gruppen von Subventionsnachfragern und -anbietern durch Kredithilfen und die Einschaltung außerbudgetärer Einrichtungen Verteilungsvorteile zu Lasten der Allgemeinheit erzielen können. Schließlich wird analysiert, wie durch konstitutionelle Regeln mögliche Schäden für die Allgemeinheit aufgrund von Kredithilfen und außerbudgetären Einrichtungen begrenzt werden können.

Im Buch wird die zentrale Hypothese überprüft, dass die Existenzgründungsförderung in ihrer derzeitigen Ausgestaltung erstens nicht nachhaltig zu mehr Beschäftigung beiträgt und sie zweitens den wirtschaftlichen Strukturwandel bremst. Für den Fördereffekt von Existenzgründungshilfen ist neben der Mikroebene vor allem auch die Makroebene relevant. Dem langfristig positiven Beschäftigungseffekt in den geförderten Gründungen stehen Verdrängungseffekte bei anderen Unternehmen gegenüber.

In den letzten Jahren wurde daher eine Umorientierung der Regionalpolitik auf eine Integration der Konzeption der regionalen Entwicklungspotentiale vorgeschlagen und eingeleitet. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Konzept der regionalen Entwicklungspotentiale auf seine Brauchbarkeit für regionalpolitische Maßnahmen überprüft. Dazu bedarf es zunächst einer grundlegenden Analyse der bislang praktizierten Regionalpolitik. Im Anschluß wird das Konzept der regionalen Entwicklungspotentiale in seinen verschiedenen Varianten vorgestellt, und es werden Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zur bislang praktizierten Regionalpolitik herausgearbeitet.

Diese lassen jedoch allzu oft eine hinreichende ökonomische Fundierung vermissen. Deshalb stellt sich der Autor die Aufgabe, die diversen Reformvorstellungen aufzugreifen und zu einer theoretisch fundierten Konzeption zusammenzuführen. Seine Argumentation ist dabei von einem zentralen Grundgedanken durchzogen. Da die Regionalpolitik der Zukunft auch ökologische, soziale, kulturelle und allgemein-politische Aspekte umfassen muß, sind zwei Zielrichtungen erkennbar: Sie muß die Koordination bzw. Integration raumrelevanter Politikbereiche vollziehen, und sie muß dezentralisiert werden im Sinne einer Regionalpolitik der Regionen. So wird plädiert für die Institutionalisierung von regionalen Netzwerken und Public Private Partnerships.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He reveals the natural anarchism of our everyday lives, and in doing so, enlarges the possibilities for a truly human society, in which our imaginations, our compassion, can have full play.” —Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States, from the Introduction  At the end of the nineteenth century, the network of anarchist collectives represented the first-ever global antisystemic movement and the very center of revolutionary tumult. In this groundbreaking and magisterial work, Žiga Vodovnik establishes that anarchism today is not only the most revolutionary current but, for the first time in history, the only one left. According to the author, many contemporary theoretical reflections on anarchism marginalize or neglect to mention the relevance of the anarchy of everyday life. Given this myopic (mis)conception of its essence, we are still searching for anarchism in places where the chances of actually finding it are the smallest.

Pragmatism and diversity,Stefan Neubert,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16002802W,/authors/OL5756474A/Stefan_Neubert,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""Diversity is both an unavoidable aspect of twenty-first century living and a powerful challenge to older philosophical traditions that still assume as normatively universal a set of values, ways of thinking, institutions, and habits of living that emerged within earlier eras of more homogeneous cultures, less developed technologies, and more accepted forms of linguistic, legal, religious, economic, political, and military domination. Within recent years, new styles of philosophical discourse, including deconstruction, postmodernism, feminism, post-colonialism, and critical race theory, have persuasively challenged these universalistic assumptions to reveal the important human differences they marginalize. Experience-based appreciation of the mutually educative potential of diverse standpoints as well as sober concern about the perils of our present times have led many thinkers to look for contemporary forms of pragmatism and cosmopolitanism as hospitable intellectual gathering places for urgently needed cross-difference conversations that may reflect and give substance to shared visions of democratic diversity. The eight authors in this volume engage in cross-difference conversations with other thinkers from earlier periods and other philosophical traditions, as well as with each other, in order to reconstruct pragmatism and cosmopolitanism in ways that are more attuned to our lived experience of diversity as well as our hopes for a diversity-appreciating democratic future""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book combines a theoretical discussion of how freedom and its opposites have been conceptualized in the republican tradition with a broader perspective on this tradition's impact on the representation of unfreedom in Western literature and cultural history. It thus complicates our understanding of what it means to be unfree and unveils a series of distinctions which also shape our modern notions of freedom.

Reforming the European Union,Daniel Finke,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16471597W,/authors/OL7068618A/Daniel_Finke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Princeton University Press|Language English,""" For decades the European Union tried changing its institutions, but achieved only unsatisfying political compromises and modest, incremental treaty revisions. In late 2009, however, the EU was successfully reformed through the Treaty of Lisbon. Reforming the European Union examines how political leaders ratified this treaty against all odds and shows how this victory involved all stages of treaty reform negotiations--from the initial proposal to referendums in several European countries. The authors emphasize the strategic role of political leadership and domestic politics, and they use state-of-the-art methodology, applying a comprehensive data set for actors' reform preferences. They look at how political leaders reacted to apparent failures of the process by recreating or changing the rules of the game. While domestic actors played a significant role in the process, their influence over the outcome was limited as leaders ignored negative referendums and plowed ahead with intended reforms. The book's empirical analyses shed light on critical episodes: strategic agenda setting during the European Convention, the choice of ratification instrument, intergovernmental bargaining dynamics, and the reaction of the German Council presidency to the negative referendums in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

In a groundbreaking exploration of the origins of our political order, Levin shows that our political divide did not originate (as many historians argue) in the French Revolution, but rather in the Anglo-American debate about that revolution. Burke and Paine were both utterly fascinating figures--active in politics, versed in philosophy, and two of the best, most effective and powerful political writers and polemicists in the history of the English speaking world. Levin sets the work of these two men against the dramatic history of their era and shows how they mixed theory and practice to advance their very different notions of liberty, equality, nature, history, reason, revolution, and reform. Paine believed in radical change and saw the American and French Revolutions as catalysts for creating a new society; Burke believed in a significantly more gradual approach with each generation acting merely as part of a long chain of history. These differing approaches to revolution and reform created a division that continues to shape our current political discourse--including issues ranging from gun control and abortion to welfare and economic reform""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Its staff operates throughout the world, and in recent years the ICRC has mounted large operations in the Balkans and Somalia. Yet despite its very important role its internal workings are mysterious and often secretive. This book examines the ICRC from its origins in the mid-nineteenth century up to the present day, and provides a comprehensive overview of a unique private organisation, whose governing body remains all-Swiss, but which is recognized in international law as if it were an inter-governmental organization. David Forsythe focuses on the policy making and field work of the ICRC, while not ignoring international humanitarian law.  He explores how it exercises its independence, impartiality, and neutrality to try to protect prisoners in Iraq, displaced and starving civilians in Somalia, and families separated by conflict in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Democrats in Congress and ""Occupy"" protesters across the country assert that the free market is not only unforgiving, it's morally corrupt. According to President Obama and his allies, only by allowing the government to heavily control and regulate business and by redistributing the wealth can we ensure fairness and compassion.  Exactly the opposite is true, says Father Robert A. Sirico in his thought-provoking new book, The Moral Case for a Free Economy. Father Sirico argues that a free economy actually promotes charity, selflessness, and kindness. And in The Moral Case for a Free Economy, he shows why free-market capitalism is not only the best way to ensure individual success and national prosperity but is also the surest route to a moral and socially-just society. In The Moral Case for a Free Economy,  Father Sirico shows:Why we can't have freedom without a free economy and why the best way to help the poor is to a start a businessWhy charity works-but welfare doesn'tHow Father Sirico himself converted from being a leftist colleague of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden to recognizing the merits of a free economyIn this heated presidential election year, the Left will argue that capitalism may produce winners, but it is cruel and unfair. But as Sirico proves in The Moral Case for a Free Economy, capitalism does not simply provide opportunity for material success, but it ensures a more ethical and moral society as well""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The police and the media are increasingly geared up to tackle international fixtures as occasions for the outbreak of crowd disorder. It can sometimes seem that the behaviour of the fans is more important than the game itself.Football on Trial examines some of the causes of football hooliganism as a European and world phenomenon. It casts an eye forward to the 1994 World Cup in Los Angeles and asks why soccer hooliganism has not been a problem in the USA. It also examines the connections between player violence and spectator violence, and considers the role of the media in producing soccer crowd disorder.The authors have built a world class reputation as authors of Hooligans Abroad and The Roots of Football Hooliganism, a reputation that this accessible and penetrating work can only add to.

The book examines four important traditions within the history of modern political philosophy and delves into how each of them addresses the problem of religion. Two of these traditions pursue projects of domesticating religion. The civil religion tradition, principally defined by Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, seeks to domesticate religion by putting it solidly in the service of politics. The liberal tradition pursues an alternative strategy of domestication by seeking to put as much distance as possible between religion and politics. Modern theocracy is a militant reaction against liberalism, and it reverses the relationship of subordination asserted by civil religion: it puts politics directly in the service of religion. Finally, a fourth tradition is defined by Nietzsche and Heidegger. Aspects of their thought are not just modern, but hyper-modern, yet they manifest an often-hysterical reaction against liberalism that is fundamentally shared with the theocratic tradition. Together, these four traditions compose a vital dialogue that carries us to the heart of political philosophy itself""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It's doubtful, as counter-examples and criticisms abound: malfunctioning, failures, and submissiveness to the interests of the most powerful states... As diplomats, practitioners with these institutions, and experts on their processes, the authors know this territory well. With what they deem a realist and constructive perspective, they underline the strengths and weaknesses that these international actors have created and won't abandon. Their research and investigations lead to the conclusion that despite the fact that it is possible to wage a war against the will of international institutions, it has become almost impossible to make peace without them. The choice of issues - collective security, disarmament, mediation, peace building, human security, reduction of poverty and inequalities, international criminal justice, multilateralism - make this edited volume a reference work on international organizations""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Readers will discover that the vast majority of the terminology cataloguing, defining, and naming theories, concepts, and analytical tools pertaining to the study of international relations are metaphorical in nature.

A range of views on the challenges of the social, political, legal and psychological reconstruction of bosnian society are presented in this volume. It draws on the knowledge and experiences of scholars and practitioners from Bosnia-Herzegovina and internationally, and presents an analysis of the Bosnian case as an example for the study of other mulit-ethnic societies emerging from war. By combining a theoretical analysis of multi-ethnic societies with practical examples, the book hopes to highlight the complexities and sensitivities of a political system in a multi-ethnic state, especially in a post-war setting.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Perhaps the best explanation to date of the roots of the political divide that threatens to irrevocably alter American government."" --Booklist (starred review) Behind today's headlines of billionaires taking over our government is a secretive political establishment with long, deep, and troubling roots. The capitalist radical right has been working not simply to change who rules, but to fundamentally alter the rules of democratic governance. But billionaires did not launch this movement; a white intellectual in the embattled Jim Crow South did. Democracy in Chains names its true architect--the Nobel Prize-winning political economist James McGill Buchanan--and dissects the operation he and his colleagues designed over six decades to alter every branch of government to disempower the majority. In a brilliant and engrossing narrative, Nancy MacLean shows how Buchanan forged his ideas about government in a last gasp attempt to preserve the white elite's power in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education. In response to the widening of American democracy, he developed a brilliant, if diabolical, plan to undermine the ability of the majority to use its numbers to level the playing field between the rich and powerful and the rest of us. Corporate donors and their right-wing foundations were only too eager to support Buchanan's work in teaching others how to divide America into ""makers"" and ""takers."" And when a multibillionaire on a messianic mission to rewrite the social contract of the modern world, Charles Koch, discovered Buchanan, he created a vast, relentless, and multi-armed machine to carry out Buchanan's strategy. Without Buchanan's ideas and Koch's money, the libertarian right would not have succeeded in its stealth takeover of the Republican Party as a delivery mechanism. Now, with Mike Pence as Vice President, the cause has a longtime loyalist in the White House, not to mention a phalanx of Republicans in the House, the Senate, a majority of state governments, and the courts, all carrying out the plan. That plan includes harsher laws to undermine unions, privatizing everything from schools to health care and Social Security, and keeping as many of us as possible from voting. Based on ten years of unique research, Democracy in Chains tells a chilling story of right-wing academics and big money run amok. This revelatory work of scholarship is also a call to arms to protect the achievements of twentieth-century American self-government""--   Read more Read less",10 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Spanning the 1850s through the present, and set against a backdrop of major political and cultural shifts around the world, the book demonstrates how international geopolitics, including the ascendance of liberal internationalism, established the conditions within which blacks imagined their freedom and, conversely, the ways in which various Middle Eastern groups have understood and used the African American freedom struggle to shape their own political movements. Lubin extends the framework of the black freedom struggle beyond the familiar geographies of the Atlantic world and sheds new light on the linked political, social, and intellectual imaginings of African Americans, Palestinians, Arabs, and Israeli Jews. This history of intellectual exchange, Lubin argues, has forged political connections that extend beyond national and racial boundaries.

W. Bush faced a critical turning point of history--the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War was the greatest shock to international affairs since World War II. In that perilous moment, Saddam Hussein chose to invade Kuwait, China cracked down on its own pro-democracy protesters, and regimes throughout Eastern Europe teetered between democratic change and new authoritarians. Not since FDR in 1945 had a U.S. president faced such opportunities and challenges. As the presidential historian Jeffrey Engel reveals in this page-turning history, behind closed doors from the Oval Office to the Kremlin, George H. W. Bush rose to the occasion brilliantly. Distrusted by such key allies as Margaret Thatcher and dismissed as too cautious by the press, Bush had the experience and the wisdom to use personal, one-on-one diplomacy with world leaders. Bush knew when it was essential to rally a coalition to push Iraq out of Kuwait. He managed to help unify Germany while strengthening NATO. Based on unprecedented access to previously classified documents and interviews with all of the principals, When the World Seemed New is a riveting, fly-on-the-wall account of a president with his hand on the tiller, guiding the nation through a pivotal time and setting the stage for the twenty-first century""--  ""The untold story of how George H.

By presenting a new and original data set and by presenting original essays by renowned scholars, this book lays the foundation for what will become an increasingly important focus for both economic development and international relations as well as for their intersection. This book contains four parts. The first introduces the core issues and concepts that are explored throughout the book as well as a new and original data set on regional public goods (RPGs). The second part further develops specific concepts important for understanding 21st-century RPGs: regional leadership, alliances, networks, and outcomes. The third part examines how cooperation takes place worldwide for a range of important RPGs. The fourth part discusses how public goods are produced in specific regions, stressing that each region has a distinct context and that these contexts overlap in a decentered ?multiplex? manner.

The inextricable embedment of religion in Muslim culture has forced a new generation of non-believing Muslims to face the heavy costs of abandoning their parents' religion: disowned by their families, marginalized from their communities, imprisoned, or even sentenced to death by their governments. Struggling to reconcile the Muslim society he was living in as a scientist and physician and the religion he was being raised in, Ali A. Rizvi eventually loses his faith. Discovering that he is not alone in his beliefs, he moves to North America and promises to use his new freedom of speech to represent the voices that are usually quashed before reaching the mainstream media--the Atheist Muslim. In The Atheist Muslim, we follow Rizvi as he finds himself caught between two narrative voices he cannot relate to: extreme Islam and anti-Muslim bigotry in a post-9/11 world. The Atheist Muslim recounts the journey that allows Rizvi to criticize Islam--as one should be able to criticize any set of ideas--without demonizing his entire people. Emotionally and intellectually compelling, his personal story outlines the challenges of modern Islam and the factors that could help lead it toward a substantive, progressive reformation""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Bezanson takes up an essential and timely inquiry into the Constitutional limits of the Supreme Court's power to create, interpret, and enforce one of the essential rights of American citizens. Analyzing contemporary Supreme Court decisions from the past fifteen years, Bezanson argues that judicial interpretations have fundamentally and drastically expanded the meaning and understanding of ""speech."" Bezanson focuses on judgments such as the much-discussed Citizens United case, which granted the full measure of constitutional protection to speech by corporations, and the Doe vs. Reed case in Washington state, which recognized the signing of petitions and voting in elections as acts of free speech. In each case study, he questions whether the meaning of speech has been expanded too far and critically assesses the Supreme Court's methodology in reaching and explaining its expansive conclusions""--  ""In this project Randall Bezanson examines judicial interpretations of free speech by means of a broad range of Supreme Court cases, arguing that over the past 15 years the Court has engaged in a truly revolutionary expansion of the reach of the free speech guarantee. The cases include the much-discussed Citizens United decision which granted the full measure of constitutional protection to speech by corporations; the Doe v. Reed case from Washington State that recognized the acts of signing petitions and voting in elections as acts of free speech; the Summum decision holding that the decision to select a monument for a public park and to reject another based on the government's disagreement with the monument's message is an act of government speech immunized from challenge by the First Amendment; and the Hurley and Dale cases that recognized free speech claims for messages and meanings that arose ""out of thin air"": speech without an author (a parade); and an author without a message (the Boy Scouts). As in earlier books on freedom of the press and of religion, Bezanson aims to arm the reader with the capacity to reach her or his own decision about whether the Court's conduct befitted the independent judicial branch and the consequences of its decisions for a representative democracy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For 150 years, Gotham's cosmopolitan setting created a unique interplay between anarchism's human actors and an urban space that invites constant reinvention.  Tom Goyens gathers essays that demonstrate anarchism's endurance as a political and cultural ideology and movement in New York from the 1870s to 2011. The authors cover the gamut of anarchy's emergence in and connection to the city. Some offer important new insights on German, Italian, and Yiddish- and Spanish-speaking anarchists. Others explore anarchism's influence on religion, politics, and the visual and performing arts. A concluding essay looks at Occupy Wall Street's roots in New York City's anarchist tradition.

But what are think tanks? Who funds them? And just how influential have they become?  In Think Tanks in America, Thomas Medvetz argues that the curious ambiguity of the think tank is less an accidental feature of its existence than the very key to its impact. By combining elements of more established sources of public knowledge—universities, government agencies, businesses, and the media—think tanks exert a tremendous amount of influence on the way citizens and lawmakers perceive the world, unbound by the more clearly defined roles of those other institutions. In the process, they transform the government of this country, the press, and the political role of intellectuals. Timely, succinct, and instructive, this provocative book will force us to rethink our understanding of the drivers of political debate in the United States.

As Ellen Wu shows, liberals argued for the acceptance of these immigrant communities into the national fold, charging that the failure of America to live in accordance with its democratic ideals endangered the country's aspirations to world leadership. Weaving together myriad perspectives, Wu provides an unprecedented view of racial reform and the contradictions of national belonging in the civil rights era. She highlights the contests for power and authority within Japanese and Chinese America alongside the designs of those external to these populations, including government officials, social scientists, journalists, and others. And she demonstrates that the invention of the model minority took place in multiple arenas, such as battles over zoot suiters leaving wartime internment camps, the juvenile delinquency panic of the 1950s, Hawaii statehood, and the African American freedom movement. Together, these illuminate the impact of foreign relations on the domestic racial order and how the nation accepted Asians as legitimate citizens while continuing to perceive them as indelible outsiders. By charting the emergence of the model minority stereotype, The Color of Success reveals that this far-reaching, politically charged process continues to have profound implications for how Americans understand race, opportunity, and nationhood""--   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Doch auf die Frage, was Leistung ist, folgt in der Regel Schweigen. Lars Distelhorst geht in seinem Essay dieser Leerstelle auf den Grund und vermag so eine tiefgehende Kritik an der ""Leistungsgesellschaft"" zu üben. Er zeigt: Jede Rede von Leistung mündet in einen unauflösbaren Widerspruch. Was hinter dem Leistungsbegriff liegt, ist nicht weniger als die Leere einer Gesellschaft, deren Zentrum in der Akkumulationsbewegung des Kapitals zu suchen ist, während sie die letzten Karten der Ideologie spielt.

EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC: THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCHOOL OF NURSING (PAKISTAN),Mary Eileen Norton,political_science,First published in 1985,/works/OL12262412W,/authors/OL5354936A/Mary_Eileen_Norton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1985|Pages 325,"The dissertation is an outgrowth of an Educational Consultation in Pakistan to develop a School of Nursing. The consultation took place during a three-year period, on three separate occasions in time periods ranging from three to five months duration.  The purposes of the work are to explore the critical issues involved in developing an innovative educational program for women in the nursing profession, in Pakistan; to describe the ""process"" and methods used to develop, evaluate, and provide continuity of development of academic structures, faculty, and curriculum; also to demonstrate that in this particular School of Nursing it was possible to develop an innovative educational program within the sociocultural context.  Data were collected through interviews with various academicians, nursing and women leaders; also by working in community health in the surrounding villages. During this time I was an observer-participant.  The work is intended to provide western educators with background material in educating students from similar circumstances in preparing them for careers in their own country, and understanding their learning needs while in the West. The material will also assist consultants, health planners, and administrators working in this type of environment.  The material is organized in three parts and explores the critical considerations of the setting, the learner, and the profession.  The conclusion discusses possible consequences of educational innovations such as alienation of the learner from her family. Another is the possibility of developing an elitist program. Also discussed are methods used to avoid these outcomes. Stress is also placed on continuing dialogue with Pakistani nurses to foster maximum participation in the improvement of nursing education and practice and insure continued development of skilled nursing leaders; therefore, helping improve the quality of life of the citizens.

The encyclopedia contains a detailed index as well as extensive bibliographical references.

The International Encyclopedia of Political Science provides an essential, authoritative guide to the state of political science at the start of the 21st century and for decades to come, making it an invaluable resource for a global readership, including researchers, students, citizens, and policy makers.

Political philosophy,Richard G.

Stevens is a comprehensive introduction to the nature of political philosophy. It offers definitions of philosophy and politics, showing the tension between the two and the origin of political philosophy as a means of resolution of that tension. Plato and Aristotle are examined in order to see the search for the best political order. Inquiry is then made into political philosophy's new tension brought about by the growth of revealed religion in the Middle Ages. It then examines the changes introduced by modernity and gives an overview of postmodern political thought. The book covers the most influential philosophers and directs readers to the classics of political philosophy, guiding them in studying them. It is an approachable introduction to a complex subject, not just a history of it. It is a point of entry into the subject for students and for others as well""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What outcomes are morally acceptable, and what ways of making peace should participants and observers find distasteful? Drawing on many of the wars and peaces of recent decades--wars whose muddled conduct and courses have already reshaped the political theory of warfare--this book offers a persuasive new perspective on postwar justice. It argues that wars should end in ""a better state of peace,"" a peace stabler and more just than the one before the war began. It asks: When should a war of secession end in the founding of a new country? What is a right outcome to a war fought for territory? And what kinds of political institutions can both protect vital political rights and nourish stability once the fighting ends? This lucid and groundbreaking book explores the outer limits of the idea that it is worth paying almost any price for peace""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Barton stresses the need for inclusionary political geography across hemispheres, nation-states, regions, races and ethnic groups, gender and sexuality, and for recognition that it is citizens who wield the power and shape the nation-states that shape them.

Drawing on twelve case studies from the global South, this book explore the politics of 'mediated citizenship' in which citizens are represented to the state through third party intermediaries who 'speak for' the people they represent. These intermediaries include political parties, non-governmental organisations, community-based organisations, social movements, armed non-state actors, networks or individuals. Collectively the cases show that mediation is both widely practiced and multi-directional in relations between states and key groups of citizens in the global South. Furthermore, they show how mediated forms of representation may have an important role to play in deepening democracy in the global South""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Red Fighting Blue, David A. Hopkins places the current partisan and electoral era in historical context, explains how the increased salience of social issues since the 1980s has redefined the parties' geographic bases of support, and reveals the critical role that American political institutions play in intermediating between the behavior of citizens and the outcome of public policy-making. The widening geographic gap in voters' partisan preferences, as magnified further by winner-take-all electoral rules, has rendered most of the nation safe territory for either Democratic or Republican candidates in both presidential and congressional elections - with significant consequences for party competition, candidate strategy, and the operation of government""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Peter Dale Scott, whose previous books have investigated CIA involvement in southeast Asia, the drug wars, and the Kennedy assassination, here probes how the policies of presidents since Nixon have augmented the tangled bases for the 2001 terrorist attack. Scott shows how America's expansion into the world since World War II has led to momentous secret decision making at high levels. He demonstrates how these decisions by small cliques are responsive to the agendas of private wealth at the expense of the public, of the democratic state, and of civil society. He shows how, in implementing these agendas, U.S. intelligence agencies have become involved with terrorist groups they once backed and helped create, including al Qaeda.

These movements have galvanized long-silent--or silenced--sectors of society: indigenous people, campesinos, students, the LGBT community, the unemployed, and all those left out of the promised utopia of a globalized economy. They have deployed a wide range of strategies and actions, sometimes building schools or clinics, sometimes occupying factories or fields, sometimes organizing political parties to take the reins of the state, and sometimes resisting government policies in order to protect their new-found power in community. This indispensable compilation of primary source material is organized in chapters by country, with each chapter introduced by a solidarity activist, writer, or academic with deep knowledge of the place. It addresses a wide range of issues, from fighting against mines and agribusiness to demanding equal participation through the recognition of language and culture, giving participants, students, and observers of social movements a chance to learn from their experiences.

Wood explains Marx's views from a philosophical standpoint and defends Marx against common misunderstandings and criticisms of his views. All the major philosophical topics in Marx's work are considered: the central concept of alienation; historical materialism and Marx's account of social classes; the nature and social function of morality; philosophical materialism and Marx's atheism; and Marx's use of the Hegelian dialectical method and the Marxian theory of value.The second edition has been revised to include a new chapter on capitalist exploitation and new suggestions for further reading. Wood has also added a substantial new preface which looks at Marx's thought in light of the fall of the Soviet Union and our continued ambivalence towards capitalism, exploring Marx's continuing relevance in the twenty-first century.

Leadership in a Small Town,Aaron Wildavsky,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL29404211W,/authors/OL2756396A/Aaron_Wildavsky,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Of all the questions that might be asked about political life, it would be difficult to find one of greater interest than the ancient query: who rules over whom? It appeals powerfully to our curiosity. We want to know who """"runs"""" things--who makes policy decisions in New York, Washington, London, or the town in which we live. Is it a single powerful individual, an economic elite, a series of elites, the citizens, political bosses, or some variant of these possibilities?The major purpose of this volume is to find an answer to this question for a small American city, and to extend the answer through relevant theory to American cities in general. But much more precisely, answers are sought for these interrelated questions: What are the relationships between the rulers and the ruled? How are the rulers related to each other? Are the rulers the same for all policies or do they differ from one area of policy to another? How do leaders arise, and in what way are they different from other people?The issues discussed in this volume are familiar to many towns. They range from controversies about the building of a new water system to housing and zoning codes, from charity appeals to low-income housing, from nominations and elections to industrial development and off-street parking. Wildavsky draws parallels to other community studies and formulates general propositions in support of his thesis that American communities are pluralist. And ultimately, Wildavsky is optimistic that small towns foster citizen participation, giving the population more of a chance to direct its own future. Aaron Wildavsky was, until his death in 1993, professor of political science and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and, while working on the present study, taught at Oberlin College. Transaction has posthumously published Wildavsky's complete essays and papers in five volumes. Nelson W. Polsby is Heller Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, wh""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At the heart of diplomacy, and a central theme of this book, is the art of negotiation. As well as involving choice of its most promising channels, this includes how to sustain momentum via a deadline, for the consequences of not settling by midnight on the clock of the talks usually concentrates minds. The examples included, such as the Iran nuclear talks, are mostly contemporary, but historical background to the diplomatic methods themselves is always provided. This helps to show that a rejuvenation of key features of traditional diplomacy has occurred in recent years that has gone largely unnoticed, partly because new labels have been given to old procedures, a notable instance being the rebranding of propaganda as 'public diplomacy'. Fully updated, new case studies explore lessons of the 2014 G20 summit in Brisbane, and those of the highly topical Budapest Memorandum on Ukraine. Berridge's comprehensive and invaluable text also includes new chapters on secret intelligence and economic and commercial diplomacy""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Endangered West makes the case for the continuation of Western power on as wide a global basis as is prudent. Is the survival of Western influence possible, or must we resign ourselves to its eventually being subordinated to more ruthless powers? Higley lays out the main policy lines that successful leadership will have to follow to preserve and strengthen Western societies. These include avoiding futile involvements in the internal problems of non-Western countries and preserving sufficient social order to permit public and private organizations to function. The West will also have to find a way to regularize treatment of the growing number of those who lack employment; invent new forms of useful work for Westerners to perform; inhibit large in-migrations, and discourage population growth. Above all, the West must address the threat of environmental disaster. There is no certain result in the struggle, but such measures will help to prevent a slide into despotism or a lapse into barbarism. Half the battle is to hold on to what the West has and, if possible, extend it. Progress will be made if elites and opinion leaders address societies' problems more competently. If the West's prestige is restored, world tensions may gradually subside, making meeting global problems more possible.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A sought-after commentator in France and a widely respected international scholar of radical Islam, Farhad Khosrokhavar has spent years studying the path towards radicalization, focusing particularly on the key role of prisonsbased on interviews with dozens of Islamic radicalsas incubators of a particular brand of outrage that has yielded so many attacks over the past decade. Khosrokhavar argues that the root problem of radicalization is not a particular ideology but rather a set of steps that young men and women follow, steps he distills clearly in this deeply researched account, one that spans both Europe and the United States. With insights that apply equally to far-right terrorists and Islamic radicals, Khosrokhavar argues that our security-focused solutions are pruning the branches rather than attacking the rootswhich lie in the breakdown of social institutions, the expansion of prisons, and the rise of joblessness, which create disaffected communities with a sharp sense of grievance against the mainstream.

This argument is applied to an analysis of the formation of knowledge and identity in liberalism; the book aims to demonstrate that 'othering' founds all modern knowledge and power relations and therefore that racism, colonialism, eugenics, patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, as well as all the past and present violences of modernity including slavery and genocide, are not aberrations, but built-in, structural and inevitable characteristics of liberal governing. Some of the chapters insist on the processes through which this 'othering' determines the formation of scientific knowledge, especially in the field of family planning. Despite being strongly inspired by Foucault, the book has a stab at the Anglo school of 'governmentality' studies that is accuses of a lazy and accomplice understanding of liberalism. It also volunteers a skeptical analysis of the euphoria surrounding the election of Barack Obama and of the future political effects of his mandate.

Bosworth looks at the glamour and squalor of the belle époque and the dark underbelly of modernization, the two world wars, and the far-reaching oppressions of the fascist regime, through to the 'Disneylandification' of Venice and the tourist boom, the worldwide attention of the biennale and film festival, and current threats of subsidence and flooding posed by global warming. He draws out major themes--the increasingly anachronistic but deeply embedded Catholic Church, the two faces of modernization, consumerism versus culture. Bosworth interrogates not just Venice's history but its meanings, and how the city's past has been co-opted to suit present and sometimes ulterior aims. Venice, he shows, is a city where its histories as well as its waters ripple on the surface""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book investigates how scholars from a variety of disciplines have defined and explained political development across what was formerly known as the 'age of absolutism'. It assesses whether the term still has utility as a tool of analysis and it explores the wider ramifications of the process of state-formation from the experience of central Europe from the early seventeenth century to the start of the nineteenth.

Great Policy Successes turns the spotlight on instances of public policy that are remarkably successful. It develops a framework for identifying and assessing policy successes, paying attention not just to their programmatic outcomes but also to the quality of the processes by which policies are designed and delivered, the level of support and legitimacy they attain, and the extent to which successful performance endures over time. The bulk of the book is then devoted to 15 detailed case studies of striking policy successes from around the world, including Singapore's public health system, Copenhagen and Melbourne's rise from stilted backwaters to the highly liveable and dynamic urban centres they are today, Brazil's Bolsa Familia poverty relief scheme, the US's GI Bill, and Germany's breakthrough labour market reforms of the 2000s. Each case is set in context, its main actors are introduced, key events and decisions are described, the assessment framework is applied to gauge the nature and level of its success, key contributing factors to success are identified, and potential lessons and future challenges are identified. Purposefully avoiding the kind of heavy theorizing that characterizes many accounts of public policy processes, each case is written in an accessible and narrative style ideally suited for classroom use in conjunction with mainstream textbooks on public policy design, implementation, and evaluation.

The Political Consequences of the Reformation,R. H. Murray,political_science,First published in 1960,/works/OL17943714W,/authors/OL4624412A/R._H._Murray,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1960|Publisher  Russell & Russell|Language English,"The appeal to the Bible was the soul of the Reformation. The Renaissance left the people untouched. The Reformation touched them deeply, and it touched them through the Sacred Record. Between Rome and the people there stands not only the might of the Sovereign but also the might of the Bible. The place of the infallible Church was taken by an infallible Book. The change was gain, but not all pure gain. The Bible belongs to a past age and records many types of civilisation. It records principles: it refuses to record maxims for the indolent or for those who prefer authoritative rules to guide every action in life. Therefore the reader must interpret it anew in the light of the present. Its truths are unchanged: its aspects are continually changing. That is, its interpretation must vary from age to age. The reformer asserted the priesthood of the believer, and this assertion carried with it the right to examine for oneself, regardless of any Ita scriptum est. Thus was provoked that habit of inquiry that lies at the very base of individualism. The interpretation of the Bible was left to the ever-varying necessities of the individual. Men were convinced that the salvation of each soul was dear in the sight of God, and they were convinced that nothing, and no one, must stand between the soul and its Creator. As the national State emerges, so does the individual, with all the advantages as well as all the drawbacks of his newly found liberty. - Introduction.

America's Revolutionary Mind: A Moral History of the American Revolution and the Declaration That Defined It,C. Bradley Thompson,political_science,First published in 2019,/works/OL24243596W,/authors/OL224357A/C._Bradley_Thompson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32068307M-M.jpg,"Publish Date November 5, 2019|Publisher  Encounter Books|Language English|Pages 584","America's Revolutionary Mind is the first major reinterpretation of the American Revolution since the publication of Bernard Bailyn's The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution and Gordon S. Wood's The Creation of the American Republic.  The purpose of this book is twofold: first, to elucidate the logic, principles, and significance of the Declaration of Independence as the embodiment of the American mind; and, second, to shed light on what John Adams once called the ""real American Revolution""; that is, the moral revolution that occurred in the minds of the people in the fifteen years before 1776. The Declaration is used here as an ideological road map by which to chart the intellectual and moral terrain traveled by American Revolutionaries as they searched for new moral principles to deal with the changed political circumstances of the 1760s and early 1770s. This volume identifies and analyzes the modes of reasoning, the patterns of thought, and the new moral and political principles that served American Revolutionaries first in their intellectual battle with Great Britain before 1776 and then in their attempt to create new Revolutionary societies after 1776.  The book reconstructs what amounts to a near-unified system of thought―what Thomas Jefferson called an “American mind” or what I call “America’s Revolutionary mind.” This American mind was, I argue, united in its fealty to a common philosophy that was expressed in the Declaration and launched with the words, “We hold these truths to be self-evident.”   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Published in Philadelphia in January of 1776, Common Sense sold 150,000 copies almost immediately. A powerful piece of propaganda, it attacked the idea of a hereditary monarchy, dismissed the chance for reconciliation with England, and outlined the economic benefits of independence while espousing equality of rights among citizens. Paine fanned a flame that was already burning, but many historians argue that his work unified dissenting voices and persuaded patriots that the American Revolution was not only necessary, but an epochal step in world history.

Highly-Skilled Migration : Between Settlement and Mobility,Agnieszka Weinar,political_science,First published in 2020,/works/OL23498970W,/authors/OL6096238A/Agnieszka_Weinar,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Springer Nature|Pages 108,"This open access short reader discusses the emerging patterns of sedentary migration versus mobility of the highly-skilled thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the recent literature on highly-skilled migration. Highly-skilled migrations are arguably the only non-controversial migrant category in political and public discourse. The common perception is that highly-skilled migrants are high-earners with top educational skills and that they are easy to integrate. These perceptions make them a “wanted” migrant. There seems to be however a big divide between the popular perceptions of this migration and its realities uncovered in social research. This publication closes this divide by delving deeper in the variety of experiences, discourses and realities of highly skilled migrants, thereby uncovering the inherent divides between the highly skilled migrants from the North and the South. The reader shows that these divides are constructed realities, shaped by the state policies and underpinned by social imaginary. Written in an accessible language this reader is a perfect read for academics, students and policy makers and all those unfamiliar with the topic.

The book analyses existing informal groups at the grassroots, furthering transnational solidarity in three thematic areas: disability, unemployment and immigration. Contributions assess how civic groups respond to the various crises affecting Europe, especially the economic and refugee crises, presenting new findings from a systematic comparative study conducted in eight European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and the UK). The research will be of interest to scholars, students, journalists, policy-makers and activists interested in civil society, social movements, charitable actions, altruism and solidarity, as well as European studies and the socio-economic challenges of current European crises.

The phenomenon of populism is typically seen as something adverse and, in the European context routinely related to xenophobic politics. What populism exactly is and who its main representatives are, however, often remains unclear. This text has two main aims: to identify populist parties in 21st century Europe and to explain their electoral performance. It argues that populist parties should not be dismissed as dangerous pariahs out of hand but rather that their rise tells us something about the state of representative democracy.The study has a broad scope, including populist parties of various ideological kinds - thus moving beyond examples of the 'right' - and covering long-established Western European countries as well as post-communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe. It presents the results of an innovative mixed-methods research project, combining a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) of populist parties in 31 European countries with three in-depth case studies of the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Recent years have seen an explosion of protest and concern about police brutality and repression--especially after long-held grievances in Ferguson, Missouri, erupted in months of violent protest following the police killing of Michael Brown. Much of the conversation has focused on calls for enhancing police accountability, increasing police diversity, improving police training, and emphasizing community policing. Unfortunately, none of these is likely to produce results, because they fail to get at the core of the problem. The problem is policing itself--the dramatic expansion of the police role over the last forty years. This book attempts to jog public discussion of policing by revealing the tainted origins of modern policing as a tool of social control and demonstrating how the expanded role of the police is inconsistent with community empowerment and social justice--even public safety. Drawing on first-hand research from across the globe, Alex Vitale shows how the implementation of alternatives to policing, like drug legalization, regulation, and harm reduction instead of the policing of drugs, has led to reductions in crime, spending, and injustice""--   Read more Read less",18 Want to read|3 Currently reading|3 Have read

Women and Politics in France 1958 - 2000 is an essential guide to the role of women in the political life of France under the Fifth Republic. The unique political history of France ensures that it remains an important and exceptional example of women's participation in the politics of a Western European country, and its study is essential in order to have a complete understanding of women and politics today.A new surge of interest in women and the French political arena was created by the campaign for parity in 1992 which produced constitutional reform and record numbers of women deputies and ministers. Women and Politics in France 1958 - 2000 is the first English language study to capture this new enthusiasm, providing useful, new research on women's political participation and covering the latest historical debates.This book includes discussion on: women's participation in traditional organisations including governments, representative assemblies and political parties women's participation in non-traditional organisations including new social and feminist movements definitions of broader political participation and the theoretical and strategic consequences of such attempts to redefine it attempts to increase the number of women in political institutions, including the campaign for parity and the debates which this has triggered.Women and Politics in France 1958-2000 is essential reading for anyone interested in the role of women in European politics.

He resolved to make a career out of the first and to keep the second a secret. Now, his sexual orientation is widely accepted, while his belief in government is embattled.  Frank: A Life in Politics from the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage is his account of America’s transformation―and the tale of a truly momentous career. From the battle over AIDS funding in the 1980s to the 2008 financial crisis, Barney Frank played a key role, and in this feisty and often moving memoir, he candidly discusses the satisfactions, fears, and grudges that come with elected office. He recalls the emotional toll of living in the closet while publicly crusading against homophobia. He discusses painful quarrels with allies; friendships with public figures, from Tip O’Neill to Sonny Bono; and how he found love with his husband, Jim Ready, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to enter a same-sex marriage. The result is the story of an extraordinary political life, an original argument for rebuilding trust in government, and a guide to how change really happens―composed by a master of the art.

Homo Americanus: The Rise of Totalitarian Democracy in America,Zbigniew Janowski,political_science,First published in 2021,/works/OL25921281W,/authors/OL34362A/Zbigniew_Janowski,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL34986513M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 23, 2021|Publisher  St. Augustines Press|Language English|Pages 250","What is the man who cannot be known apart from his socio-political environment? As Zbigniew Janowski asserts, one does not ask who this man is, for he does not even know himself. This man is suppressed and separated, and not by Fascism or Communism. In present-day America this has been accomplished by democracy.  “Only someone shortsighted, or someone who values equality more than freedom, would deny that today’s citizens enjoy little or no freedom, particularly freedom of speech, and even less the ability to express openly or publicly the opinions that are not in conformity with what the majority considers acceptable at a given moment. It may sound paradoxical to contemporary ears, but a fight against totalitarianism must also mean a fight against the expansion of democracy.”  Janowski all at once brazen and out of bounds states what he calls the obvious and unthinkable truth: In the United States, we are already living in a totalitarian reality. The American citizen, the Homo Americanus, is an ideological being who is no longer good or bad, reasonable or irrational, proper or improper except when measured against the objectives of the dominating egalitarian mentality that American democracy has successfully incubated. American democracy has done what other despotic regimes have likewise achieved––namely, taken hold of the individual and forced him to renounce (or forget) his greatness, pursuit of virtue and his orientation toward history and Tradition.  Homo Americanus, Janowski argues, has no mind or soul and he cannot tolerate diversity and indeed he now censors himself. Democracy is not benign, and we should fear its principles come by and applied ad hoc. It is deeply troublesome that in the way democracy moves today it gives critics no real insight into any trajectory of reason behind its motion, which is erratic and unmappable. The Homo Americanus is an ideological entity whose thought and even morality are forbidden from universal abstraction.  Janowski mounts the offensive against what the American holds most sacred, and he does so in order to save him. After exposing the danger and the damage done, Janowski makes another startling proposal. It is a “diseased collective mind” that is the source of this ideology, the liberal anti-perspective that presses man into the image of the Homo Americanus, and its grip can only be broken through the recovery of instinct. Homo Americanus cannot be free again until he is himself again. That is, until the shadow that belongs only to him is restored, and he is thereby no longer alienated from others. Despite the condemnation Janowski seems to be levying on the citizen of the United States, he betrays a great hope and confidence that the means to shake ourselves awake from the bad dream are nevertheless in hand.  Janowski’s work is the next title in St. Augustine’s Press Dissident American Thought Today Series. It occupies a controversial overlapping terrain between the philosophical descriptions of liberalism as a tradition, psychology and the fundamentally influential critiques of democracy offered by Thucydides, Jefferson, Franklin, Tocqueville, Mill, Burke and more. More anecdotal than analytical, Janowski offers the contemporary proof that the reader is right to be scandalized by democracy and his or her own likeness of the Homo Americanus. Once upon a time it was the despicable Homo Sovieticus fruit of tyranny, but now we fear democratic society too might fall and all its citizens never be found again.

It draws from a rich spectrum of regional integration theories to determine what the Union actually is and how it is developing. The book examines constitutional politics of the European Union, from the Single European Act to the Treaty of Nice and beyond. The ongoing debate on the future of Europe links together questions of democracy and legitimacy, competences and rights, and the prospects for European polity-building. The aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the emerging European polity and the questions that further treaty reform generate for the future of the regional system. The authors also assess the evolving European security architecture, the limits and possibilities of a genuine European foreign, security and defence policy, and the role of the European Union in the post-Cold War international system. Common themes involve debates about stability and instability, continuity and change, multipolarity and leadership, co-operation and discord, power capabilities and patterns of behaviour. The book traces the defining features of the 'new order' in Europe and incorporates an analysis of the post-September 11 context. This major new edition will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students with an interest in the politics and governance of contemporary Europe, as well as to those pursuing a career in international affairs.

From the DOJ to the NSA, from the EPA to the Department of Health and Human Services, Barack Obama's administration has become a labyrinth of corruption and overreach touching every aspect of Americans' lives. The People vs. Barack Obama strips away the soft media picture of the Obama administration to reveal a regime motivated by pure, unbridled power and details how each scandal has led to dozens of instances of as-yet-unprosecuted counts of espionage, involuntary manslaughter, violation of internal revenue laws, bribery, and obstruction of justice. The story of the Obama administration is a story of abuse, corruption, and venality on the broadest scale ever to spring from the office of the presidency. President Obama may be the culmination of a century of government growth--but more important, he is the apotheosis of the imperial presidency. Obama chooses when to enforce immigration laws, delays his own Obamacare proposals when it is politically convenient to do so, micromanages the economy, attacks the Supreme Court, Congress, and the sovereign states. And he proclaims that he alone is the voice of the people while encroaching on their rights. In The People vs. Barack Obama, Ben Shapiro brings Obama into the people's court and addresses each of his abuses of power""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Für die Analyse dieser Frage wird das Grundmodell von Barro und Gordon dahingehend erweitert, daß Reputation auch dann aufgebaut werden kann, wenn die Antiinflationspolitik unglaubwürdig erscheint. Hierbei treten nun allerdings reale Kosten auf, die von der erwarteten und von der gesellschaftlich präferierten Inflationsrate abhängen. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird der Erfolg der Bundesbank nicht nur auf deren Unabhängigkeit, sonden auch auf die Stabilitätskultur in Deutschland zurückgeführt. Die Europäische Zentralbank wird sich dagegen heterogenen Stabilitätsauffassungen gegenübersehen. Es wird gezeigt, daß externe Anreize eine Antiinflationspolitik sicherstellen können.

There were no survivors. Now it's happened again. But this time, two creatures have emerged from the wreckage alive . . .  One is a small being that is kind and benevolent, brimming with intense emotion and intelligence. The other, however, is an animal of remarkable strength and power. It has been brought clandestinely to our world with one sole purpose: the total extinction of all life on Earth. It is called the Destroyer of Worlds.  Only the Event Group, the most secret agency in the history of the U.S. government, is prepared to wage battle against such a creature. The Event Group is a dedicated collection of the nation's most brilliant men and women of science, philosophy and the military. Their difficult task: solving the mysteries of the past and uncovering the hidden truths behind the myths and legends propagated throughout world history. In doing so they protect America from past mistakes---and ensure that history's errors will never be repeated.  An act of war that started in New Mexico decades ago, and was covered up by another far darker organization, has been discovered by the Group at the same time as the new and seemingly identical incident threatens to wipe out the Earth's population. In the desert wastelands of the American Southwest, a battle is about to commence as the two creatures set out to fulfill their own destinies among the human race.  Led by the valiant Major Jack Collins, the Event Group wages total war in the heat-soaked sands of the desert landscape. Using the benevolent creature as an ally and resource, they combine forces with the powerful might of the U.S. military and prepare themselves for an epic battle against the most dangerous threat against human existence that history has ever seen.

Carlile,"THE POLITICAL AND MISCELLANEOUS WORKS OF THOMAS PAINE, Thomas Paine, R. Carlile, London, 1819 2 vol.  (possibly) First Collected Edition of Thomas Paine's work.  A fascinating, rich volume of original source material. This must be one of the earliest compilations of Thomas Paine's work (he died in 1809), yet I'm unable to find reliable evidence of that.  It's certainly complete with all his major works and many, many minor letters. The version of the same work (only vol. 2) on Google books has a slightly different pagination in the Letters to Washington (see below and look for the ?'s) which may be an error in the restoration of THIS volume, or a re-collation of the pages that Google scanned. No one really minds the store at Google, so it's difficult to examine their product. Full details of pages should be examined carefully by buyer and compared with your needs.  Vol. 1 has been scanned by Robart Univ. Toronto (link below)  8vo, 2 volumes 9 x 5.5, about 500 pages each (see complex pagination below)  Later grey cloth 1/4 over original grey paper boards. Professional archival restoration added new spine, glued band, new front and back archival endpapers (although original flys are retained), new front and back pastedowns all with substantial attachment of untrimmed pages.  Kind of like a bionic book - better than it was. Restoration probably in 1930s/40s based on the style & condition of the spine label and age of bookplate. In fine shape for the next 100+ years.  CONDITION NOTES: Original paper boards heavily worn at corners. Boards are straight and new binding is excellent with fine caps and clear spine title. Untrimmed pages toned at edges and occasionally foxed. Restored spine shows some toning. No marks, except for bookplate of Wayland Hyatt Smith. Page attachment and hinge strength is fine. No pages missing [except the possibility of an original (not restored) back fly on Vol. 2]. PAGINATION (original only, restoration added 1 fly front and back both volumes): - hang on, it's wild ride...

Attracting foreign direct investment is a viable way of ensuring the external financing of developing countries. Foreign direct investment flows, in turn, are determined by the decisions of multinational enterprises. One important determinant of investment decisions is the political environment of potential host countries. Political risks like expropriations, riots, revolutions or civil wars are important obstacles for investment. This book empirically analyzes the impact of political risks on foreign direct investment flows to Latin American countries. A case study of Mexico and its policy towards foreign investors offers further empirical evidence for the importance of the political environment for investment decisions of multinationals.

Examining both ancient and early modern conceptions of civic republicanism, the contributors respond to the work of thinkers ranging from Plato and Aristotle to Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and Wollstonecraft. A testament to the continuing influence of the concept and the ongoing scholarly debate which surrounds it, On Civic Republicanism addresses fundamental questions regarding democratic participation, liberal democracy, and the public good. Its essays speak to the many ways in which the idea of the republic still challenges us today.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Spanning the twentieth century, the book tracks the rise and fall of women-only state protective laws--such as maximum hour laws, minimum wage laws, and night work laws--from their roots in progressive reform through the passage of New Deal labor law to the feminist attack on single-sex protective laws in the 1960s and 1970s. Nancy Woloch considers the network of institutions that promoted women-only protective laws, such as the National Consumers' League and the federal Women's Bureau; the global context in which the laws arose; the challenges that proponents faced; the rationales they espoused; the opposition that evolved; the impact of protective laws in ever-changing circumstances; and their dismantling in the wake of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Above all, Woloch examines the constitutional conversation that the laws provoked--the debates that arose in the courts and in the women's movement. Protective laws set precedents that led to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and to current labor law; they also sustained a tradition of gendered law that abridged citizenship and impeded equality for much of the century. Drawing on decades of scholarship, institutional and legal records, and personal accounts, A Class by Herself sets forth a new narrative about the tensions inherent in women-only protective labor laws and their consequences.""--Book jacket.

External intervention, interstate war, political upheaval and interethnic violence are compounded by the vagaries of oil prices and the claims of military, nationalist and religious movements. The purpose of this book is to set this region and its conflicts in context, providing on the one hand a historical introduction to its character and problems, and on the other a reasoned analysis of its politics. In an engagement with both the study of the Middle East and the theoretical analysis of international relations, the author, who is one of the best known and most authoritative scholars writing on the region today, offers a compelling and original interpretation.  Written in a clear, accessible and interactive style, the book is designed for students, policymakers, and the general reader.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In THE ACCIDENTAL SUPERPOWER international strategist Peter Zeihan examines how geography, combined with demography and energy independence, will pave the way for one of the great turning points in history, and one in which America reasserts its global dominance. No other country has a greater network of internal waterways, a greater command of deepwater navigation, or a firmer hold on industrialization technologies than America. Zeihan argues that the future is undoubtedly bright for America, the only country with enough young adults to fill the capital-generating void that will be left behind by 2030. THE ACCIDENTAL SUPERPOWER also explores shale oil and its surprising key role in America's move towards energy independence and how it will shape (and is already shaping) American life for the next fifty years""--   Read more Read less",29 Want to read|2 Currently reading|3 Have read

Intimately reported, this is the story of the men and women who, watching their friends and lovers fall, ignored by public officials, religious leaders, and the nation at large, and confronted with shame and hatred, chose to fight for their right to live. We witness the founding of ACT UP and TAG (Treatment Action Group), the rise of an underground drug market in opposition to the prohibitively expensive (and sometimes toxic) AZT, and the gradual movement toward a lifesaving medical breakthrough. With his unparalleled access to this community David France illuminates the lives of extraordinary characters, including the closeted Wall Street trader-turned-activist; the high school dropout who found purpose battling pharmaceutical giants in New York; the South African physician who helped establish the first officially recognized buyers' club at the height of the epidemic; and the public relations executive fighting to save his own life for the sake of his young daughter. Expansive yet richly detailed, this is an insider's account of a pivotal moment in the history of American civil rights""--  ""A history of AIDS activism in New York in the early years of the plague""--   Read more Read less",17 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

He's realized that he-and all of us as fellow citizens-must fall in love with America-again.  In this book, DeMint introduces Americans all across the country who are working towards the same goal, We see example after example of Americans coming together locally in what DeMint calls the ""little platoons""-the families, churches, communities and voluntary organizations succeeding on the model that smaller is better. They are the hands-on citizens who make America the exceptional, caring and can-do country it has always been.  DeMint illustrates why each of us-regardless of political party, age, race, religion or ethnicity-must rediscover the power we represent. The country's future is at risk, not just because of constant pressure from ""the Bigs"" (big government, big banks, big labor, big Wall Street cronies etc.), but because so many of us fear it's too late to solve problems so huge and seemingly intractable. Jim DeMint is here to reassure us that this is not true.  In riveting yet plainspoken style, he tells real-life success stories and affirms the compelling truth that conservative ideas are really American ideas, and they must guide us as we turn our institutions upside-down, taking them from the top-down centrally-controlled bureaucracies they've become back to the bottom-up democratic framework the Constitution intended.  Through this heartfelt, fascinating and inspiring look inside the America of both yesterday and today, and the everyday citizens who are working tirelessly and selflessly to insure its future fulfills the promise of its beginnings, Jim DeMint is beckoning us to join him on one of the most meaningful and momentous journeys we have ever undertaken together: FALLING IN LOVE WITH AMERICA AGAIN.

WikiLeaks. The Syrian Electronic Army. Edward Snowden. Bitcoin. The Arab Spring. Digital communication technologies have thrust the calculus of global political power into a period of unprecedented complexity. In every aspect of international affairs, digitally enabled actors are changing the way the world works and disrupting the institutions that once held a monopoly on power. No area is immune: humanitarianism, war, diplomacy, finance, activism, or journalism. In each, the government departments, international organizations and corporations who for a century were in charge, are being challenged by a new breed of international actor. Online, networked and decentralized, these new actors are innovating, for both good and ill, in the austere world of foreign policy. They are representative of a wide range of 21st century global actors and a new form of 21st century power: disruptive power. In Disruptive Power, Taylor Owen provides a sweeping look at the way that digital technologies are shaking up the workings of the institutions that have traditionally controlled international affairs. The nation state system and the subsequent multinational system were founded on and have long functioned through a concentration of power in the state. Owen looks at the tools that a wide range of new actors are using to increasingly control international affairs, and how their rise changes the way we understand and act in the world. He considers the bar for success in international digital action and the negative consequences of a radically decentralized international system. What new institutions will be needed to moderate the new power structures and ensure accountability? And how can governments and corporations act to promote positive behavior in a world of disruptive innovation? Owen takes on these questions and more in this probing and sober look at the frontier of international affairs, in a world enabled by information technology and increasingly led by disruptive innovators. With cutting edge analysis of the fast-changing relationship between the declining state and increasingly powerful non-state actors, Disruptive Power is the essential road map for navigating a networked world.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In [this book], legendary television journalist Bob Schieffer examines today's journalism and those who practice it -- how they see their profession, how it has been changed by new technology, and how well they believe they are carrying out their responsibility to provide American with the information they need to be good citizens.

Under Mongol auspices various commodities, ideologies and technologies were disseminated across Eurasia. The focus of this path-breaking study is the extensive exchanges between Iran and China. The Mongol rulers of these two ancient civilizations 'shared' the cultural resources of their realms with one another. The result was a lively traffic in specialist personnel and scholarly literature between East and West. These exchanges ranged from cartography to printing, from agriculture to astronomy. The book concludes by asking why the Mongols made such heavy use of sedentary scholars and specialists in the elaboration of their court culture and why they initiated so many exchanges across Eurasia. This is a work of great erudition which crosses new scholarly boundaries in its analysis of communication and culture in the Mongol empire.

R. Reid guides a whirlwind tour ofsuccessful health care systems worldwide, revealing possible pathstoward U.S. reformIn The Healing of America, New York Timesbestselling author T. R. Reid shows how all the otherindustrialized democracies have achieved something the UnitedStates can’t seem to do: provide health care for everybody at areasonable cost.In his global quest to find a possible prescription,Reid visits wealthy, free market, industrialized democracieslike our own—including France, Germany, Japan, the U.K.,and Canada—where he finds inspiration in example. Reidshares evidence from doctors, government officials, health careexperts, and patients the world over, finding that foreign healthcare systems give everybody quality care at an affordable cost.And that dreaded monster “socialized medicine”turns out to be a myth. Many developed countries provideuniversal coverage with private doctors, private hospitals, andprivate insurance.In addition to long-established systems, Reid alsostudies countries that have carried out major health carereform. The first question facing these countries—and theUnited States, for that matter—is an ethical issue: Is healthcare a human right? Most countries have already answered witha resolute yes, leaving the United States in the murky moralbackwater with nations we typically think of as far less just thanour own.The Healing of America lays bare the moral questionat the heart of our troubled system, dissecting the misleadingrhetoric surrounding the health care debate. Reid sees problemselsewhere, too: He finds poorly paid doctors in Japan, endlesslines in Canada, mistreated patients in Britain, spartan facilitiesin France. Still, all the other rich countries operate at a lowercost, produce better health statistics, and cover everybody.In the end, The Healing of America is a good news book: Itfinds models around the world that Americans can borrow toguarantee health care for everybody who needs it.

The missing man, Robert Levinson, appeared in pictures dressed like a Guantánamo prisoner and pleaded in a video for help from the United States. Barry Meier, an award-winning investigative reporter for The New York Times, draws on years of interviews and never-before-disclosed CIA files to weave together a riveting narrative of the ex-agent's journey to Iran and the hunt to rescue him. The result is an extraordinary tale about the shadowlands between crime, business, espionage, and the law, where secrets are currency and betrayal is commonplace. Its colorful cast includes CIA operatives, Russian oligarchs, arms dealers, White House officials, gangsters, private eyes, FBI agents, journalists, and a fugitive American terrorist and assassin. Missing Man is a fast-paced story that moves through exotic locales and is set against the backdrop of the twilight war between the United States and Iran, one in which hostages are used as political pawns. Filled with stunning revelations, it chronicles a family's ongoing search for answers and one man's desperate struggle to keep his hand in the game""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He'd been on the run for weeks, his picture blazoned across newspapers all over Palestine. As leader of the Stern Gang, he had committed spectacular and murderous crimes, sparking outcry from both British and Jewish groups. An intellectual poet and mystic, Stern believed himself destined for greatness; the Jewish liberator of British Palestine. Drawn always to the margins - his writings were drenched in images of martyrdom and blood. Assistant Superintendent Geoffrey Morton, a middle-class Londoner who had swopped milk deliveries for the dangers of colonial policing, was the man tasked with stopping Stern. Seemingly so different, in fact the men had much in common - ambition, dedication and conviction in his own righteousness. The incidents of that morning would be endlessly contested but two things were clear; Morton had cornered Stern and, minutes later, shot him dead. The shots Morton fired that day would echo down the remaining years of British rule in Palestine and through the titanic events that shaped the birth of Israel. Based on revelatory research, the private archive of Morton and interviews with witnesses, The Reckoning is the first book to tell the tale of a rebel who terrorized Palstine, the lawman determined to stop him and the creation of a cult of martyrdom that destroyed any hope of compromise between Arab and Jew.

Based upon documents gathered using Access to Information requests, human rights investigations and in-country interviews, Canada in Haiti tells how Canada, the USA and France undermined the overthrow of Haiti’s elected government. In a country already the poorest in the western hemisphere, this has led to thousands of deaths, unimaginable suffering and further impoverishment. Canada in Haiti is a cry to the citizens of rich countries to understand what is being done in our name to the descendants of the world’s only successful slave rebellion.

Starting with a brief description of its history leading up to 1980, this book deals with South Korea's transition to democracy, the stunning economic development achieved since the 1960s, the 1997 financial crisis, and the economic reforms that followed and concludes with the North Korean nuclear crisis and foreign relations with regional powers. The theoretical framework of this book addresses how democratization affected all of these dimensions of South Korea. For instance, democratization allowed for the more frequent alternation of political elites from conservative to liberal and back to conservative. These elites initiated different policies for dealing with North Korea and held different views on South Korea's role in its alliance with the United States. Consequently, ideological divides in South Korean politics became more stark and the political process more combative""--Provided by publisher.

This book asserts that legitimate governance requires explanations for such trade-offs and then demonstrates that such explanations can always be found, though not for every possible choice. In so doing, John W. Patty and Elizabeth Maggie Penn use the tools of social choice theory to provide a new and discriminating theory of legitimacy. In contrast with both earlier critics and defenders of social choice theory, Patty and Penn argue that the classic impossibility theorems of Arrow, Gibbard, and Satterthwaite are inescapably relevant to, and indeed justify, democratic institutions. Specifically, these institutions exist to do more than simply make policy - through their procedures and proceedings, these institutions make sense of the trade-offs required when controversial policy decisions must be made""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But the enduring work that protests do often can't be seen in the moment. It feels powerful to march, but when and how does marching matter? In this original and richly illustrated account, activist and organizer L.A. Kauffman delves into the history of America's major demonstrations, beginning with the legendary 1963 March on Washington, to reveal what protests accomplish and how their character has shifted over time. Using the signs that demonstrators carry as rich clues to how protests are organized, Kauffman explores the nuanced relationship between the way movements are made and the impact they have. How to Read a Protest sheds new light on the catalytic power of collective action and the bottom-up, women-led model for organizing that's transforming what movements look like and what they can win""--Provided by publisher.

How did democracy come about? What characteristics must a polity possess in order to be properly dubbed democratic? What is the relationship between capitalism and democracy? What are some challenges facing democracies in the 21st century? In this thorough but concise handbook by one of America's foremost political scientists, Yale professor Dahl (Democracy and Its Critics) answers these and other questions. The book is a highly structured work organized around subtopics on the origins of democracy, the democratic idea, actual democracies and conditions that favor or impede the development of democracy. Dahl discusses the tension between citizen participation and system effectiveness, the relative strengths and weaknesses of presidential versus parliamentary systems. Some of the best sections address the tension that exists in societies (e.g., the U.S.) where a democratic system based on political equality coexists with market capitalism, which yields economic inequality. Especially helpful are short """"words about words"""" segments in which Dahl defines and clarifies terminology that is often used imprecisely (e.g., republic, representative, plurality system, etc.). Dahl's primary concern is the intersection between theory and practice, but his work is peppered with historical references to such advocates and critics of democracy as Plato, John Stuart Mill and James Madison. Dahl nimbly sketches the various issues and neatly frames controversies for the reader. His accessible style makes this an excellent introduction for novices, as well as a trusty handbook for experts and political science mavens.

Bush, possesses a nuclear arsenal built with technology from the United States and Europe, and financed with the help of America’s allies in the Muslim world. Its dictatorial president, Pervez Musharraf, faces widespread civil opposition, and militant extremists threaten his life every day. The nuclear weapons programs in North Korea and Iran, as well as Libya’s now-defunct atomic effort, relied heavily on expertise and materials provided by the nuclear smuggling network headed by Pakistan’s national hero, A.Q. Khan. The United States – from Carter and Reagan, through Bush I, Clinton, and the current president – and other Western governments knew all along that Pakistan was first developing and then exporting nuclear technology, yet consistently turned a blind eye in order to gain Pakistan’s cooperation during the Cold War and, more recently, in the war on terror. As a result of this Faustian bargain, nuclear technology has been allowed to spread far and wide, dramatically increasing the chances that terrorists or unfriendly regimes will someday get their hands on an atomic device.  David Armstrong and Joseph Trento provide a new and unrivalled perspective on the so-called A.Q. Khan nuclear black market scandal, including exclusive accounts from customs agents, intelligence analysts, and other ground-level front-line operatives. Documented in these pages are maddening experiences of official interference and breathtaking instances of indifference and incompetence. Trento and Armstrong name names and reveal stunning new information about proliferators in an expose; that is sure to generate headlines. This secret history of how the Islamic bomb was developed and how nuclear arms have proliferated is as fascinating as it is disturbing.

Or so it seems.Vice President Charlie Haskell, who will travel anywhere for a photo op, is about to cut the ribbon for the just-completed American Moonbase. The first Mars voyage is about to leave high orbit, with a woman at the helm. Below, the world is marveling at a rare solar eclipse.But all that is right is about to go disastrously wrong when an amateur astronomer discovers a new comet. Named for its discover, Tomikois a ""sun-grazer,""an interstellar wanderer with a hundred times the mass and ten times the speed of other comets. And it is headed straight for our moon.In less than five days, if scientists' predictions are right, Tomiko will crash into the moon, shattering it into a cloud of superheated gas, dust, and huge chunks of rock that will rain down on the earth, causing chaos and killer storms, possibly tidal waves inundating entire cities...or worse: a single apocalyptic worldwide ""extinction event.""In the meantime, the population of Moonbase must be evacuated by a hastily assembled fleet of shuttle rockets. There isn't room, or time enough, for everyone. And the vice president, who rashly promised to be last off (""I will lock the door and turn off the lights""), is trying to figure out how to get away without eating his words.In Moonfall,McDevitt has created a disaster thriller of truly epic proportions, featuring a cast of unforgettable characters: the reluctant Russian rocket jockey entrusted with the lives of squabbling refugees; the woman chosen to be first on the moon; the scientist who must deflect the ""possum"" (POSSible IMpactors) knocked from orbit or witness the end science itself. And at the center of it all is Charlie Haskell, the career politician who discovers his own unexpected reserves of only himself and his country, but for all humankind.Moonfall,is a spellbinding tale of heroism and hope, cowardice and passion played against the awesome spectacle of human history's darkest night.

Zukunftsorientierte Industriepolitik,Guntram Hepperle,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500764W,/authors/OL8908904A/Guntram_Hepperle,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 368,"Industriepolitik ist einer der schillerndsten Begriffe der Wirtschaftswissenschaften. Überwiegend wird Industriepolitik als unzulässiger Eingriff in den marktlichen Allokationsmechanismus abgelehnt. In der wirtschaftspolitischen Praxis findet sich Industriepolitik dagegen fast ausnahmslos in jedem Land und zu jeder Zeit. Der Autor beleuchtet kritisch die Divergenz zwischen theoretischer Empfehlung und empirischer Realität. Ziel der Arbeit ist es, eine industriepolitische Konzeption zu entwickeln, die sowohl der theoretischen Kritik als auch der Tatsache, daß in der Realität stets Industriepolitik betrieben wird, Rechnung trägt. Theoretische Grundlage hierfür ist die Integration verschiedener Ansätze der Wachstums- und Wettbewerbstheorie sowie der Theorie des Strukturwandels.

Conventional wisdom certainly seems to believe so. In the aftermath of the interim nuclear deal struck in November 2013 between the Islamic Republic and the P5+1 powers (the United States, France, England, Russia, China and Germany), hopes are now running high for a historic reconciliation between Iran's clerical regime and the West.  Yet there is already ample reason for skepticism that the United States and Europe can truly curb Iran's nuclear ambitions by diplomatic means. Moreover, the current focus on Iran's nuclear program on the part of Western governments is deeply dangerous, because it fails to recognize-let alone address-Iran's other international activities, or its foreign policy ambitions. Those objectives are global in scope, and they are growing. ""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Olmsted reexamines the explosive labor disputes in the agricultural fields of Depression-era California, the cauldron that inspired a generation of artists and writers and that triggered the intervention of FDR's New Deal. Right Out of California tells how this brief moment of upheaval terrified business leaders into rethinking their relationship to American politics--a narrative that pits a ruthless generation of growers against a passionate cast of reformers, writers, and revolutionaries. Olmsted reveals how California's businessmen learned the language of populism with the help of allies in the media and entertainment industries, and in the process created a new style of politics: corporate funding of grassroots groups, military-style intelligence gathering against political enemies, professional campaign consultants, and alliances between religious and economic conservatives. The business leaders who battled for the hearts and minds of Depression-era California, moreover, would go on to create the organizations that launched the careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. A riveting history in its own right, Right Out of California is also a vital chapter in our nation's political transformation whose echoes are still felt today""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This volume aims to problematize furthermore the ways in which global discourses of democracy, modernity, emancipation, liberty, secularism, individual rights, and liberalism translate on the ground in the region""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To understand a thwarted Turkish coup, an anti-Wall Street encampment, and a packed Tahrir Square, we must first comprehend the power and the weaknesses of using new technologies to mobilize large numbers of people. Tufekci explains the nuanced trajectories of modern protests--how they form, how they operate differently from past protests, and why they have difficulty persisting in their long-term quests for change. Tufekci speaks from direct experience, combining on-the-ground interviews with insightful analysis. She describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy Movement that started in New York, and the empowering effect of tear gas in Istanbul's Gezi Park. These details from life inside social movements complete a moving investigation of authority, technology, and culture--and offer essential insights into the future of governance.

Gessen charts their paths against the machinations of the regime that would crush them all, and against the war it waged on understanding itself, which ensured the unobstructed reemergence of the old Soviet order in the form of today's terrifying and seemingly unstoppable mafia state.

Conservative Insurgency,Kurt Schlichter,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL21296498W,/authors/OL7540977A/Kurt_Schlichter,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28836180M-M.jpg,"Publish Date July 15, 2014|Publisher  Post Hill Press|Language English|Pages 280","Conservative Insurgency takes the form of an oral history of a successful struggle against progressive dominance from the perspective of the year 2041. It is not a novel; instead, it is a rallying cry and a battle plan for constitutional conservatives who feel outnumbered and outgunned by a liberal establishment that wants to make them extinct and Republican moderates who are more than happy to lose if it means they keep getting invitations to all the right parties.  Conservative Insurgency lays out the history of this struggle from the point of view of various participants as America inaugurates a new president and fully re-commits to the conservative vision of the Founders. The testimonies of the characters – politicians, academics, activist, soldiers and even a gender-indefinite performance artist who finds that liberalism is more constraining than conservatism ever could be – describe a multi-front, long-term political, social, and cultural war designed to seize society’s high ground in order to restore the Founders’ vision.  It is not a war of violence but one of persuasion and action. The weapons are not arms but arguments – though the transition is not entirely peaceful as progressives refuse to honor basic rights when it means they must give up power.  Why an insurgency? Because conservatives won’t win a stand up fight today – the enemy is too powerful, and to do so risks allowing them to destroy us forever in detail. Military history provides many useful analogies for this peaceful struggle. Remember the Vietnamese insurgents during Tet in 1968? They came out of the jungles during that holiday season in an attempt to take over the South in one fell swoop. They were annihilated, despite the best efforts of a liberal United States media to portray it to the contrary. They simply made their move far too soon. They went back underground and, seven years later, they took Saigon.  How does a force that is always “losing” end up winning? That’s the key question, and one the oral histories of the 30+ characters answers.  Author Kurt Schlichter is uniquely suited to write this book. A Townhall,com featured columnist and conservative media commentator, he was personally recruited by Andrew Breitbart to write for the conservative legend’s “Big” websites. Kurt has a large Twitter following and four consecutive Amazon kindle bestselling “Political Humor” e-books, but he is also a trial lawyer who served in the Army infantry from Operation Desert Storm to Operation Enduring Freedom in Kosovo. His background, including a masters of strategic studies from the United States Army War College, give him a unique perspective on politics, government and the strategy and tactics of an insurgent movement. His work as a stand-up comic helps give this serious subject a humorous edge.  Conservative Insurgency shows how we need to engage the enemy everywhere – politics, the media, the law, academia and, as Andrew Breitbart taught us, popular culture. From the faculty lounge to the news room to the recording studio to the boardroom, we will never again simply write-off anywhere in our society to the progressives. There can be no safe havens for those who reject the basic freedoms our Founders enshrined in the Constitution.  Conservative Insurgency is not about losing gloriously but about winning gloriously. Through the experiences of its many vivid characters, it lays out some general concepts and ideas about how to do it. They say the Tea Party is dead. Nonsense. We’re still here. We’re still ready to fight. And we’re going to fight, each in our own way, and take America back.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It seeks to engage students by illustrating the relevance of international issues to their own lives. The book is not organized around individual countries or particular governments, but around political ideas, institutions, processes, and problems. It moves progressively from examples familiar to American students to a non-Western emphasis, allowing students to learn important basic concepts and then apply them to a global setting.""--Back cover.

Los idus de octubre: Reflexiones sobre la crisis de la socialdemocracia y el futuro del PSOE,Josep Borrell,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL17719565W,/authors/OL5856054A/Josep_Borrell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26348374M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Catarata|Language Spanish|Pages 179,"La socialdemocracia europea pierde apoyo electoral, sufre una hemorragia militante, discrepancias ideológicas y divisiones internas. Esa crisis no se puede comprender a golpe de titulares o de frases huecas. Y menos aún la del PSOE que, después de facilitar una investidura sin contrapartidas del Gobierno del PP, atraviesa una grave situación. En este ensayo, Josep Borrell ofrece una detallada reflexión sobre un tema que conoce bien gracias a su formación académica y amplia trayectoria política. Combina el rigor de los datos y la precisión de la crónica con una sinceridad que le lleva a admitir que su partido “ha sufrido un gran fracaso colectivo como consecuencia de que los socialistas ‘no se han dicho la verdad’ con respecto a sus ambiciones personales y sus actitudes ante la formación de Gobierno”. La gravedad de los hechos ocurridos desde el Comité Federal del 1 de octubre del 2016 le lleva a equipararlo con los idus de marzo, cuando el asesinato del César sumió al Imperio romano en largas guerras civiles. Y desmonta las razones supuestamente patrióticas que, en la perspectiva de la cuestión catalana, se usaron para justificar la ofensiva contra la Ejecutiva de Pedro Sánchez. Analiza las disyuntivas a las que se enfrenta el PSOE desde el punto de vista del modelo de partido —más participativo y menos oligárquico—, del modelo de Estado en la perspectiva federal, en su capacidad de socializar la política y en su política de alianzas. Considera que la solución que se dé a la crisis tendrá consecuencias, no solo para el PSOE, sino para el futuro del país. Porque lo que está en juego es la elección entre dos modelos de partido y entre dos concepciones sobre cómo la socialdemocracia declinante puede reconquistar una mayoría social en sociedades que sufren el contrachoque de la globalización.

Some of us are told we live in a """"cancer cluster""""--An area with a disproportionate number of cancer deaths. During the summer months, those who live in or near urban areas are bombarded with daily smog measurements and air pollution alerts. City water supplies are frequently called health hazards. At times, it seems as though virtually everything we eat and drink is denounced as bad for us by some """"public health expert."""" Our cars burn too much gasoline; we own too many firearms; we are too fat; some of us are too skinny. Americans today are living longer than they ever have before. Why the almost daily announcements of new public health threats and proclamations of impending crises? Bennett and DiLorenzo address this question and others here. They begin by examining the large public health bureaucracy, its preoccupation with expanding governmental programs, and its concern with political issues that too often have little to do with improving public health. Then they trace the evolution of the American public health movement from its founding after the Civil War to the 1950s. They describe the transformation of public health's focus from the eradication of disease to social policy as a by-product of the 1960s. Bennett and DiLorenzo catalogue the """"radicalization"""" of the public health movement by discussing its numerous political initiatives. They include case studies of the politicization of the public health movement in America. The authors reveal various methods of statistical manipulation that certain public health researchers use to """"cook the data"""" in order to achieve politically correct results. A final chapter discusses the implications of the transformation of public health from pathology to politics. This vigorously argued analysis sees the public health movement as claiming expertise on virtually every social issue, from poverty to human rights. Students of public pol""--Provided by publisher.

We hear the inspiring voices of ordinary citizens and activists practicing a cutting-edge form of organizing developed by the nonprofit law firm, the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). Their methodology is an answer for the frustrations of untold numbers of activists who have been defeated time and again by corporate political power and legal entitlement. Instead of fighting against what we don't want, this book can teach us to create from the ground up what we do want, basing our vision in local control and law. This work is about finishing the American Revolution by giving up the illusion of democracy and forging a system of true self-governance. In addition, this is about recognizing in law, for the first time in history, that nature possesses legally enforceable rights of its own.

But safe from what, and from whom? In his 60-plus years as a trial lawyer, Gerry Spence has never represented a person accused of a crime in which the police hadn't themselves violated the law. Whether by covering up their own corrupt dealings, by the falsification or manufacture of evidence, or by the outright murder of innocent civilians, those individuals charged with upholding the law break it every day, in ways more scandalous than the courts have dared admit. The police and prosecutors won't charge or convict themselves, and so the crimes of the criminal justice system are swept under the rug. Nothing changes. Too many police officers are killers on the loose, and every uninformed American is a potential next victim. Police culture is mired in the dead weight of precedent and ruled by trigger-happy tyrants. Power will march our nation over the police state precipice unless We the People take action. The FBI's massacre of the Weaver family at Ruby Ridge; the killing of mortally-wounded Fouad Kaady by a group of police officers; the torture of teenaged Dennis Williams by cops seeking a murder confession--again and again, the question arises: When the very men and women we pay to protect us instead persecute us every day, how can we be safe? In Police State, Spence slaps a stinging indictment upon the American justice system and puts forth a plan to restore liberty and justice for all""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Laing shows how the straitjacket of conformity imposed on us all leads to intense feelings of alienation and a tragic waste of human potential. He throws into question the notion of normality, examines schizophrenia and psychotherapy, transcendence and 'us and them' thinking, and illustrates his ideas with a remarkable case history of a ten-day psychosis. 'We are bemused and crazed creatures,' Laing suggests. This outline of 'a thoroughly self-conscious and self-critical human account of man' represents a major attempt to understand our deepest dilemmas and sketch in solutions.'Everyone in contemporary psychiatry owes something to R.D. Laing' Anthony Clare, the Guardian.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Economic processes are analysed empirically and by means of regression analyses with a spatial perspective and in the framework of the new economic geography over a time span of almost two decades. The results for the manufacturing industries and for regional specialization show which economic centres played a role for the economic development of the country over time. The roles which agglomerations and regional specialization can play are discussed with a view to the problems of cohesion in Hungary, the enlarged EU and future EU accession countries. The conclusions also take into account the current political and academic debate regarding European regional policy.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Anarchy and Geography: Reclus and Kropotkin in the UK,Federico Ferretti,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL18193466W,/authors/OL5043806A/Federico_Ferretti,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26665910M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 247,"This book provides a historical account of anarchist geographies in the UK and the implications for current practice. It looks at the works of Frenchman Élisée Reclus (1830–1905) and Russian Pyotr Kropotkin (1842–1921) which were cultivated during their exile in Britain and Ireland.  Anarchist geographies have recently gained considerable interest across scholarly disciplines. Many aspects of the international anarchist tradition remain little-known and English-speaking scholarship remains mostly impenetrable to authors. Inspired by approaches in historiography and mobilities, this book links print culture and Reclus and Kropotkin’s spheres in Britain and Ireland. The author draws on primary sources, biographical links and political circles to establish the early networks of anarchist geographies. Their social, cultural and geographical context played a decisive role in the formation and dissemination of anarchist ideas on geographies of social inequalities, anti-colonialism, anti-racism, feminism, civil liberties, animal rights and ‘humane’ or humanistic approaches to socialism.  This book will be relevant to anarchist geographers and is recommended supplementary reading for individuals studying historical geography, history, geopolitics and anti-colonialism.

But not Michael Bloomberg and Carl Pope. Bloomberg, an entrepreneur and former mayor of New York City, and Pope, a lifelong environmental leader, approach climate change from different perspectives, yet they arrive at similar conclusions. Without agreeing on every point, they share a belief that cities, businesses, and citizens can lead--and win--the battle against climate change, no matter which way the political winds in Washington may shift. In Climate of Hope, Bloomberg and Pope offer an optimistic look at the challenge of climate change, the solutions they believe hold the greatest promise, and the practical steps that are necessary to achieve them. Writing from their own experiences, and sharing their own stories from government, business, and advocacy, Bloomberg and Pope provide a road map for tackling the most complicated challenge the world has ever faced. Along the way, they turn the usual way of thinking about climate change on its head: from top down to bottom up, from partisan to pragmatic, from costs to benefits, from tomorrow to today, and from fear to hope. Bloomberg and Pope explore climate change solutions that will make the world healthier and more prosperous. They aim to begin a new type of conversation on the issue that will spur bolder action by cities, businesses, and citizens--and even, someday, by Washington.""--Jacket.

The original columns were published in various newspapers and periodicals in the Northwest and Southern California during the late 1980s and early 1990s, although much of it has appeared either updated or as new material within the last few years. Although politically pertinent at the time of its publication, the original material is timeless, as pertinent and fresh today as when written. The current material is, of course, as timely as today’s and tomorrow’s headlines.    The author’s eclectic interests and broad experience have ideally prepared him to drop Chicken Little on the spin doctors who terrify the general public with their dire predictions of immanent disaster. We may no longer huddle in our backyard bomb shelters like our parents during the 1950s, but we spend millions of personal dollars “protecting” ourselves from a vast entourage of things we sincerely believe will harm us (after all, Carl Sagan said…), and we spend billions in tax dollars solving “problems” that exist primarily in the minds of agenda-driven, self-appointed experts who have managed to convince themselves and us that that acorn was a precursor to the fall of heaven itself.

Rubinstein presents a critique of the thesis, made familiar by Wiener, Sampson, Barnett and others, that Britain has failed in economic terms because of its anti-industrial and pre-modern cultural values and class system. He argues that Britain was never an industrial economy, rather a commercial and financial one whose comparative advantage always lay in that area. He examines Britain's cultural values, class system and elite structure to demonstrate that these were unusually rational and modern by comparison with the more newly industrialised powers, and that features of the class system, such as the public schools, were actually instrumental in enhancing this competitive advantage. Emphasising the importance of the City of London and addressing socialism, Keynsianism and Thatcherism, Rubinstein provides an energetic and challenging contribution to this debate.

Core factors that characterized it-political stability, ideological openness, and rapid economic growth-are unraveling. Since the 1990s, Beijing's leaders have firmly rejected any fundamental reform of their authoritarian one-party political system, even as a decades-long boom has reshaped China's economy and society. On the surface, their efforts have been a success. Political turmoil has toppled former Communist East bloc regimes, internal unrest overtaken Middle East nations, and populist movements risen to challenge established Western democracies. China, in contrast, has appeared a relative haven of stability and growth. But as [the author] shows, a closer look at China's reform era reveals a different truth. Over the past three decades, a frozen political system has fueled both the rise of entrenched interests within the Communist Party itself, and the systematic underdevelopment of institutions of governance among state and society at large. Economic cleavages have widened. Social unrest has worsened. Ideological polarization has deepened. Now, to address these looming problems, China's leaders are progressively cannibalizing institutional norms and practices that have formed the bedrock of the regime's stability in the reform era. Technocratic rule is giving way to black-box purges; collective governance sliding back towards single-man rule. The post-1978 era of 'reform and opening up' is ending. China is closing down. Uncertainty hangs in the air as a new future slouches towards Beijing to be born. End of an Era explains how China arrived at this dangerous turning point, and outlines the potential outcomes that could result.""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Feminist Five became a global cause celebre, with Hillary Clinton speaking out on their behalf and activists inundating social media with #FreetheFive messages. But the Five are only symbols of a much larger feminist movement of civil rights lawyers, labor activists, performance artists, and online warriors prompting an unprecedented awakening among China's educated, urban women. In Betraying Big Brother, journalist and scholar Leta Hong Fincher argues that the popular, broad-based movement poses the greatest challenge to China's authoritarian regime today. Through interviews with the Feminist Five and other leading Chinese activists, Hong Fincher illuminates both the difficulties they face and their ""joy of betraying Big Brother,"" as one of the Feminist Five wrote of the defiance she felt during her detention. Tracing the rise of a new feminist consciousness now finding expression through the #MeToo movement, and describing how the Communist regime has suppressed the history of its own feminist struggles, Betraying Big Brother is a story of how the movement against patriarchy could reconfigure China and the world   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Focuses on how race and class inevitably structure vastly unequal life prospects Shows how human society can be organized in a way that does not socialize children for lives of routine labour Looks towards contribution, not distribution, as a way to promote racial equality Argues that by sharing routine and complex labor, social relationships would be transformed, eliminating competition for limited opportunities to develop and contribute abilitiesA discussion board for ideas and comments relating to the book can be found at: http://howtomakeopportunityequal.blogspot.com/   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Tibet also exercises immense 'soft power' as one of the lenses through which the world views China. This book traces the origins and manifestations of the Tibetan myth, as propagated by Younghusband, Madam Blavatsky, Himmler, Acheson and Roosevelt. The authors discuss how, after WW2, Tibet-- isolated, misunderstood and with a tiny elite unschooled in political-military realities--misread the diplomacy between its two giant neighbours, India and China, forlornly hoping London or Washington might intervene. China's People's Liberation Army sought nothing less than to deconstruct traditional Tibet, unseat the Dalai Lama and 'absorb' this vast region into the People's Republic, and Lhasa succumbed to China's invasion in 1950. Drawing on declassified CIA and Chinese documents, the authors reveal Mao's collusion with Stalin to subdue Tibet, double-dealing by Nehru, the brilliant diplomacy of Chou en Lai and how Washington see-sawed between the China lobby, who insisted there be no backing for an independent Tibet, and Presidents Truman and later Eisenhower, who initiated a covert CIA programme to support the Dalai Lama and resist Chinese occupation. It is an ignoble saga with few, if any, heroes, other than ordinary Tibetans""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Like the Thought Police of George Orwell's 1984, powerful special interest groups on the left are mounting a withering assault on our rights in the name of ""social equality"". Liberty has been turned on its ear as the rights of the few restrict the freedoms of everyone.. In The New Thought Police, author Tammy Bruce, a self described lesbian feminist activist, cuts through the deluge of politically correct speech and thought codes to expose the dangerous rise of left-wing McCarthyism.

Republicans have lost four of the last six presidential races and lost the popular vote in five of the last six. In their lone victory, the party incumbent won-during wartime-by the slimmest of margins. In this fascinating and important book, Thomas Schaller examines national Republican politics since President Ronald Reagan left office in 1989. From Newt Gingrich's ascent to Speaker of the House through the defeat of Mitt Romney in 2012, Schaller traces the Republican Party's institutional transformation and its broad consequences, not only for Republicans but also for America. Gingrich's ""Contract with America"" set in motion a vicious cycle, Schaller contends: as the GOP became more conservative, it became more Congress-centered, and as its congressional wing grew more powerful, the party grew more conservative. This dangerous loop, unless broken, may signal a future of increasing radicalization, dependency on a shrinking pool of voters, and less viability as a true national party. In a thought-provoking conclusion, the author discusses repercussions of the GOP decline, among them political polarization and the paralysis of the federal government""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whether it is an explosive surge of protest calling for racial justice in the United States, a demand for democratic reform in Hong Kong or Mexico, a wave of uprisings against dictatorship in the Middle East, or a tent city on Wall Street that spreads throughout the country, when mass movements erupt onto our television screens, the media portrays them as being as spontaneous and unpredictable.  In [this book], political analysts Mark and Paul Engler uncover the organization and well-planned strategies behind such outbursts of protest, examining core principles that have been used to spark and guide moments of transformative unrest.  [This book] traces the evolution of civil resistance, providing new insights into the contributions of early experimenters such as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., groundbreaking theorists such as Gene Sharp and Frances Fox Piven, and contemporary practitioners who have toppled repressive regimes in countries such as South Africa, Serbia, and Egypt.  Drawing from discussions with activists now working to defend human rights, challenge corporate corruption, and combat climate change, the Englers show how people with few resources and little influence in conventional politics can nevertheless engineer momentous upheavals""--   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Perry's new book is a personal and scholarly exploration of the idea of human rights. Perry is one of our nation's leading authorities on the relation of morality, including religious morality, to politics and law. He seeks, in this book, todisentangle the complex idea of human rights by way of four probing and interrelated essays.* The initial essay, which is animated by Perry's skepticism about the capacity of any secular morality to offer a coherent account of the idea of human rights, suggests that the first part of the idea of human rights--the premise that every human being is ""sacred"" or ""inviolable""--is inescapablyreligious. Responding to recent criticism of ""rights talk"", Perry explicates, in his second essay, the meaning and value of talk about human rights. In his third essay, Perry asks a fundamental question about human rights: Are they universal?   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This means that we cannot be satisfied with defining transnational activists through the ways they think. The defining feature of transnationalism in this book is relational, and not cognitive. This emphasis on activism's relational structure means that even as they make transnational claims, transnational activists draw on the resources, the networks, and the opportunities in which they are embedded, and only then - if at all - on more distant transnational links. But we can no more sharply draw a line between domestic and international politics in studying transnational activism than we could ignore local politics in studying its national equivalent. Understanding the processes that link the local, the national and the international is the major undertaking of the book.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In addition, he argued that domestic fascism--rather than international communism--posed the primary threat to the nation. He even welcomed Communists into his campaign, admiring their commitment to peace. Focusing on what Wallace himself later considered his campaign's most important aspect, the troubled relationship between non-Communist progressives like himself and members of the American Communist Party, Thomas W. Devine demonstrates that such an alliance was not only untenable but, from the perspective of the American Communists, undesirable, as well""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This is a world erupting with new money and new power, changing so fast it breaks all sense of reality, where life is seen as a whirling, glamorous masquerade where identities can be switched and all values are changeable. It is a completely new type of society where nothing is true and everything is possible--yet it is also home to a new form of authoritarianism, built not on oppression but avarice and temptation. Peter Pomerantsev, ethnically Russian but raised in England, came to Moscow work in the fast-growing television and film industry. The job took him into every nook and corrupt cranny of the country: from meetings in smoky rooms with propaganda gurus through to distant mafia-towns in Siberia. As he becomes more successful in his career, he gets invited to the best parties, becomes friend to oligarchs and strippers alike, and grows increasingly uneasy as he is drawn into the mechanics of Putin's post-modern dictatorship. In Nothing is True and Everything is Possible, we meet Vitaliy, a Mafia boss proudly starring in a film about his own crimes; Zinaida, a Chechen prostitute who parties in Moscow while her sister is drawn towards becoming a Jihadi; and many more. These 21st century Russians grew up among Soviet propaganda they never believed in, became disillusioned with democracy after the fall of communism, and are now filled with a sense of cynicism and enlightenment. Pomerantsev captures the bling effervescence of oil-boom Russia, as well as the steadily deleterious effects of all this flash and cynicism on the country's social fabric. A long-nascent conflict is flaring up in Russia as a new generation of dissidents takes to the streets, determined to defy the Kremlin and fight for a society where beliefs and values actually count for something. The stories recounted in Nothing is True and Everything is Possible are wild and bizarre and lavishly entertaining, but they also reveal the strange and sober truth of a society's return from post-Soviet freedom to a new and more complex form of tyranny""--   Read more Read less",16 Want to read|2 Currently reading|5 Have read

Grit, manliness, individualism, merit, profit and providence, dominion over our environment, thrift, and above all pride in our country -- these qualities define us, and are the reason that hundreds of millions of people worldwide look to America for hope, inspiration, and opportunity. But it's precisely these virtues that now are under attack by the radical Left of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and their followers. America as we know it is eroding before our eyes and becoming what Fox News Channel personality Eric Bolling calls a ""politically correct nanny state."" The rewards for individual achievement and hard work, our basic constitutional rights, religious faith, national identity, and capitalism itself, are being replaced by a dangerous socialistic ideology that is the polar opposite of what our Founding Fathers intended America to be. It time for us to wake up and heed the clear-cut warning signs that America is heading in the wrong direction. Eric Bolling knows firsthand what makes America great. Raised in a struggling blue-collar family in Chicago, his parents showed him that hard work and firm values can get you far in life. Those values drove him as a young baseball player to being drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, then success as a New York Mercantile Exchange trader, and now his daily role on Fox News Channel. A celebration of America that is informed by Bolling personal story, Wake Up America is a call to arms for America citizens to preserve and protect our country's present and future.

After all, we have banned discrimination against women, required equal pay for equal work, and adopted family-leave legislation. But the fact is that we have a two-tiered system, where some working women have a full panoply of rights while others have few or none at all. We allow blatant discrimination by small employers. Domestic workers are cut out of our wage and overtime laws. Part-time workers, disproportionately women, are denied basic benefits. Laws are written through a process of compromise and negotiation, and in each case vulnerable workers were the bargaining chip that was sacrificed to guarantee the policy's enactment. For these workers, the system that was supposed to act as a safety net has become a sieve-and they are still falling through. Caroline Fredrickson is a powerful advocate and D.C. insider who has witnessed the legislative compromises that leave out temps, farmworkers, employees of small businesses, immigrants, and other workers who fall outside an intentionally narrow definition of ""employees."" The women in this fast-growing part of the workforce are denied minimum wage, maternity leave, health care, the right to unionize, and protection from harassment and discrimination-all within the bounds of the law. If current trends continue, their fate will be the future of all American workers. ""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The contributors examine several political phenomena, including cabinet post allocation, nominations, preelectoral coalitions, split-ticket voting, and the size of party systems and faction systems. Significantly, they also consider various ways in which the constitutional system—especially whether the head of government is elected directly or indirectly—can modify the incentives created by the electoral system. The findings presented here demonstrate that the success of electoral reform depends not only on the specification of new electoral rules per se but also on the political context—and especially the constitutional framework—within which such rules are embedded.

Jeremy Waldron explores the implications of this fundamental tenet for law, politics, society and economy in the company of John Locke, whose work Waldron regards 'as well-worked-out a theory of basic equality as we have in the canon of political philosophy'. Throughout the text, which is based on the Carlyle Lectures given in Oxford in 1999, Jeremy Waldron discusses contemporary approaches to equality and rival interpretations of Locke, and this dual agenda gives the whole an unusual degree of accessibility and intellectual excitement, of interest to philosophers, political theorists, lawyers and theologians around the world.

Set apart from the rest of the hemisphere by culture, language and history, Brazil has also been viewed by its neighbors as a potential great power, and at times, a threat. But even though domestic aspirations and foreign perceptions have held out the prospect for Brazil becoming a major power, the country has lacked the capabilities--particularly on the military and economic dimensions--to pursue a traditional path to greatness. Aspirational Power examines Brazil as a rising power. It explains Brazil's predilection for soft power through a historical analysis of Brazil's three previous attempts to achieve major power status, each of which shaped its present strategy. Though Brazil's efforts to rise have fallen short it will continue to try to overcome the obstacles to its rise, whether those obstacles are domestic or international""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

According to the Eurobarometer, which recurrently puts this question to a sample of citizens from all the countries of the Union, 'freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the EU': this is the reply given, year after year, by the majority of the interviewees. It is not the Euro, nor democracy, nor peace among nations, but free movement which epitomizes the European Union in the minds of Europeans.Ettore Recchi describes the free movement regime of the EU in terms of both its policies and the experiences of the people involved - that is, mobile European citizens. With a particular focus on their integration paths, political participation and identifications, this book draws on large cross-national surveys of this specific population carried out between 2004 and 2012, as well as in-depth interviews and aggregate statistical data from a plethora of sources.Based on an unprecedented wealth of empirical information, but also on a thorough examination of the historical and legal underpinnings of free movement rights in the EU, this is essential reading for scholars and practitioners of migration, EU studies, international relations and politics. But it offers food for thought to social and political theorists as well, helping to assess the extent to which this unique frontierless migration regime bolsters denationalization and spearheads a cosmopolitan order in the making""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Geopolitics: re-visioning world politics,John A.

Identifying and scrutinizing the central features of geopolitics from the past to the present, Agnew pays close attention to its persisting conceptual underpinnings, novel turns and shifting impacts. The book focuses on five key concepts of the modern geopolitical imagination: visualising the world as a whole; the definition of geographical areas as 'advanced' or 'primitive'; the notion of the state being the highest form of political organisation; the pursuit of primacy by competing states; and the necessity for hierarchy.  Addressing topical issues such as the re-integration of Hong Kong into China, the proposed expansion of powers of the EU at the expense of member states and the threatened break-up of states such as Canada, Spain, Russia and the UK, Agnew shows how questions of the organization of power combine with those of geographical definition and highlights the crucial geopolitical 'certainties' from as recently as ten years ago which are now either gone or in question.

Endless war corrupts absolutely. Ever since 9/11 America has fought an endless war on terror, seeking enemies everywhere and never promising peace. In Pay Any Price, James Risen reveals an extraordinary litany of the hidden costs of that war: from squandered and stolen dollars, to outrageous abuses of power, to wars on normalcy, decency, and truth. In the name of fighting terrorism, our government has done things every bit as shameful as its historic wartime abuses -- and until this book, it has worked very hard to cover them up. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus. FDR authorized the internment of thousands of Japanese Americans. Presidents Bush and Obama now must face their own reckoning.""--Jacket.

She grew up in majority-white schools, organizations, and churches, and has spent her life navigating America's racial divide as a writer, a speaker, and an expert helping organizations practice genuine inclusion. While so many institutions claim to value diversity in their mission statements, many fall short of matching actions to words. Brown highlights how white middle-class evangelicalism has participated in the rise of racial hostility, and encourages the reader to confront apathy and recognize God's ongoing work in the world.

The various contributions included in the book, selected using a peer review process, present important studies and research conducted in various countries around the globe. The majority of these studies are concerned with the analysis, modeling and formalization of the behavior of groups or committees that are in charge of making decisions of social and economic importance. Decisions in these contexts have to meet precise coherence standards and achieve a significant degree of sharing, consensus and acceptance, even in uncertain and fuzzy environments. This necessitates the confluence of several research fields, such as foundations of social choice and decision making, mathematics, complexity, psychology, sociology and economics. A large spectrum of problems that may be encountered during decision making and decision analysis in the areas of economics and the social sciences, together with a broad range of tools and techniques that may be used to solve those problems, are presented in detail in this book, making it an ideal reference work for all those interested in analyzing and implementing mathematical tools for application to relevant issues involving the economy and society.

The contributors engage in a comprehensive exploration of what is arguably the most dynamic and important region in the world. Significantly, this volume addresses the multiple manifestations of regionalism in Asia and is consequently organised thematically under the headings of: - conceptualizing the region - economic issues - political issues - strategic issues - regional organizations. As such, the handbook presents some of the key elements of the competing interpretations of this important and highly contested topic, giving the reader a chance to evaluate not just where Asian regionalism is going but also how the scholarship on Asian regionalism is analysing these trends and events.""--Publisher's description.

Vrin|Language French|Pages 270,"""Wittgenstein est un philosophe du langage, de l'esprit, et en particulier un philosophe de la subjectivité ; pas seulement de la grammaire de la première personne, ou de la logique du scepticisme, mais de la subjectivité comme exprimée dans le langage, comme articulation du dedans et du dehors : comme voix humaine. Le mythe de l'intériorité se révèle, dans cette approche, comme un mythe de l'inexpressivité : on préfère un ""privé"" inaccessible, muet, à la réalité (corporelle) et à la fatalité du vouloir-dire. C'est bien le réalisme (""la chose la plus difficile"", dit Wittgenstein) qu'on découvre alors au bout du scepticisme""--Page 4 of cover.

Judentum zwischen Anarchie und Theokratie: Eine religionspolitische Diskussion am Beispiel der Begegnung zwischen Walter Benjamin und Gershom Scholem,Gabriele Guerra,political_science,First published in 2007,/works/OL17797881W,/authors/OL5712659A/Gabriele_Guerra,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26387415M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Aisthesis Verlag|Language German|Pages 250,"In dieser Studie wird die Position von Intellektuellen deutscher Sprache und jüdischer Herkunft religionspolitisch eingeordnet. Indem gezeigt wird, wie in ihrem Denken und Schreiben religiöse und theologische Begriffe – z.B. „Gottes Reich“, „Theokratie“ „Apokalypse“ oder „Messias“ – kulturpolitisch umfunktioniert werden, lassen sich die besonderen Rollen von Walter Benjamin und Gershom Scholem – als Außenseiter schlechthin bekannt – aus ihrem religions­politischen und historischen Kontext her neu begründen. Paradigmatisch dafür wird das Phänomen des „theokratischen Anarchismus“ diskutiert, der – so Benjamin und Scholem 1919 – für sie „die sinnvollste Antwort auf die Politik“ darstelle. Aus diesem Zusammenhang heraus lässt sich eine politische Theologie des Deutsch-Judentums (hier auch am Beispiel von Ernst Bloch, György Lukács, Martin Buber, Gustav Landauer, Kurt Hiller u.a.) als eine besondere Beziehung zwischen Macht und Transzendenz, zwischen dem Einzelnen und der Gemeinschaft neu denken.

Politics to the extreme,Scott A.

American political institutions are notorious for producing gridlock under the best of circumstances. Every indication is that political elites are polarized to a degree not seen in the US since the Civil War. With parties and interests seemingly uninterested in compromise arrayed against one another, these institutions are ill-equipped to respond to these profound challenges. Data consistently illustrates the increasing ideological polarization between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. In the 95th Senate conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans overlapped in the center of the political spectrum. A decade later the degree of ideological overlap was minimal; and in the 109th Congress had all but disappeared. The result is the almost complete gridlock the country has experienced over the last decade. In Politics to the Extreme leading scholars and experts address the causes and consequences of polarization in American politics, and suggest solutions for bridging the partisan divide""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How Bernie won,Jeff Weaver,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL19748080W,/authors/OL3824212A/Jeff_Weaver,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27378518M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 378,"The brilliant manager of Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign shows how Bernie took on the entire establishment and changed modern American politics for good. When Jeff Weaver hopped in a car with Bernie Sanders in the summer of 1986, he had no idea the Vermont backroads would lead them all the way to the 2016 presidential campaign. In How Bernie Won, Weaver shows how Bernie sparked a movement that would sweep America and inspire millions. He vowed not to run a negative campaign. He would focus on policies, not personalities. He would not be beholden to big money. He would actually make America work for ordinary people. Weaver also shows how they overcame significant challenges: a media that thrived on negative campaigns. A party controlled by insiders. And a political system dependent on big money. Weaver explains how Bernie beat them all and, in doing so, went from having little national name recognition when he entered to the race to being one of the most respected and well-known people in the world by its end--because, Weaver argues, Bernie won the race. He moved the discussion from the concerns of the 1% to those of the 99%. He forced the Democrats to remember their populist roots. And he showed that an outsider with real ideas and ways to get them done could compete and win against the establishment's hand-picked candidate. From holding bags of ""Bernie buttons"" and picket-stick signs, to managing thousands of campaign workers, to looking ahead to 2020, Weaver chronicles the birth of a revolution that didn't end in November 2016. It's only just begun.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Famed trial lawyers Paul Minor and Richard (Dickie) Scruggs and renowned judge and former prosecutor Bobby DeLaughter proved to be the nexus of these scandals. Seven attorneys and a former state auditor were alleged to have attempted to bribe or to have actually bribed five state judges to rule in favor of Minor and Scruggs in several lawsuits. This is the story of how federal authorities, following up on information provided by a bank examiner and a judge who could not be bribed, toppled Minor, Scruggs, and their enablers in what was exposed as the most significant legal scandal of twenty-first-century Mississippi. James R. Crockett details the convoluted schemes that eventually put three of the judges, six of the attorneys, and the former auditor in federal prison. All of the men involved were successful professionals and three of them, Minor, Scruggs, and fellow attorney Joey Langston, were exceptionally wealthy. The stories involve power, greed, but most of all hubris. The culprits rationalized abominable choices and illicit actions to influence judicial decisions. The crimes came to light in those six years, but some crimes were committed before that. These men put themselves above the law and produced the perfect storm of bribery that ended in disgrace. The tales Crockett relates about these scandals and the actions of Paul Minor and Dickie Scruggs are almost unbelievable. Individuals willingly became their minions in power plays designed to distort the very rule of law that most of them had sworn to uphold""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book argues that although electing black legislators yields meaningful outcomes in the lives of African-American voters in the United States, drawing affirmative action districts does not impact policy outcomes for black constituents""--  ""The symbolic importance of Barack Obama's election is without question. But beyond symbolism, does the election of African-American politicians matter? Grose argues that it does and presents a unified theory of representation. Electing African-American legislators yields more federal dollars and congressional attention directed toward African-American voters. However, race and affirmative action gerrymandering have no impact on public policy passed in Congress. Grose is the first to examine a natural experiment and exceptional moment in history in which black legislators - especially in the U.S. South - represented districts with a majority of white constituents. This is the first systematic examination of the effect of a legislator's race above and beyond the effect of constituency racial characteristics. Grose offers policy prescriptions, including the suggestion that voting rights advocates, the courts, and redistricters draw ""black decisive districts,"" electorally competitive districts that are likely to elect African Americans""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With a sharp understanding of Marxist theory and labor history, Moody charts a well-reasoned course for the future of rank-and-file struggle.Kim Moody was a founder of Labor Notes and is a member of the National Union of Journalists and a senior research fellow at the Work and Employment Unit of the University of Hertfordshire. ""--  ""THIS EXPANSIVE COLLECTION, Kim Moody, one of the world's most authoritative and recognized labor writers, explores the present state and the future possibilities of the US labor movement, as well as evaluating the forces working against it. These wide-ranging, accessible essays ask the key questions: What has happened to union organizing in the United States? Is there an alternative to the strike? How does the increased presence of immigrant and women workers change the balance of forces? What strategies can workers use to counteract company ""union avoidance"" campaigns and bureaucratic ""business unionism""? What is the role of socialists in the labor movement? Drawing on his own background as a working-class radical, the works of Karl Marx, and the everyday experiences of nurses, miners, autoworkers, and more, Moody sketches a comprehensive picture of the state of US labor--and points the way forward for a rank-and-file union movement that can win real change""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet it has not been an easy path; military catastrophe, political atrophy, and economic upheavals have made regular appearances from the feudal era to the present. Today, Japan is seen as a has-been with a sluggish economy, an aging population, dysfunctional politics, and a business landscape dominated by yesterday's champions. Though it is supposed to be America's strongest ally in the Asia-Pacific region, it has almost entirely disappeared from the American radar screen. In Japan and the Shackles of the Past, R. Taggart Murphy places the current troubles of Japan in a sweeping historical context, moving deftly from early feudal times to the modern age that began with the Meiji Restoration. Combining fascinating analyses of Japanese culture and society over the centuries with hard-headed accounts of Japan's numerous political regimes, Murphy not only reshapes our understanding of Japanese history, but of Japan's place in the contemporary world. He concedes that Japan has indeed been out of sight and out of mind in recent decades, but contends that this is already changing. Political and economic developments in Japan today risk upheaval in the pivotal arena of Northeast Asia, inviting comparisons with Europe on the eve of the First World War. America's half-completed effort to remake Japan in the late 1940s is unraveling, and the American foreign policy and defense establishment is directly culpable for what has happened. The one apparent exception to Japan's malaise is the vitality of its pop culture, but it's actually no exception at all; rather, it provides critical clues to what is going on now. With insights into everything from Japan's politics and economics to the texture of daily life, gender relations, the changing business landscape, and popular and high culture, Japan and the Shackles of the Past is the indispensable guide to understanding Japan in all its complexity. - Publisher.

In this book, Bruce E. Cain argues that the reasons are an unrealistic civic ideal of a fully informed and engaged citizenry and a neglect of basic pluralist principles about political intermediaries. This book traces the tension between populist and pluralist approaches as it plays out in many seemingly distinct reform topics, such as voting administration, campaign finance, excessive partisanship, redistricting, and transparency and voter participation. It explains why political primaries have promoted partisan polarization, why voting rates are declining even as election opportunities increase, and why direct democracy is not really a grassroots tool. Cain offers a reform agenda that attempts to reconcile pluralist ideals with the realities of collective-action problems and resource disparities""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Timing and turnout,Sarah F. Anzia,political_science,First published in 2013,/works/OL19987529W,/authors/OL7597378A/Sarah_F._Anzia,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 277,"""Public policy in the United States is the product of decisions made by more than 500,000 elected officials, and the vast majority of those officials are elected on days other than Election Day. And because far fewer voters turn out for off-cycle elections, that means the majority of officials in America are elected by a politically motivated minority of Americans. Sarah F. Anzia is the first to systemically address the effects of election timing on political outcomes, and her findings are eye-opening. The low turnout for off-cycle elections, Anzia argues, increases the influence of organized interest groups like teachers' unions and municipal workers. While such groups tend to vote at high rates regardless of when the election is held, the low turnout in off-cycle years enhances the effectiveness of their mobilization efforts and makes them a proportionately larger bloc. Throughout American history, the issue of election timing has been a contentious one. Anzia's book traces efforts by interest groups and political parties to change the timing of elections to their advantage, resulting in the electoral structures we have today. Ultimately, what might seem at first glance to be mundane matters of scheduling are better understood as tactics designed to distribute political power, determining who has an advantage in the electoral process and who will control government at the municipal, county, and state levels."" -- Publisher's description.

Der Beitritt erfordert von Polen sowohl die Übernahme des acquis communautaire als auch eine geeignete Vorbereitung des polnischen Telekommunikationsmarktes auf die EU-Wettbewerbsverhältnisse. Unter Berücksichtigung der verfügbaren Technologien, des Grades der bereits erfolgten rechtlichen Anpassung und auf Basis einer landesweiten Marktanalyse wird die im Sinne des Universaldienstziels definierte Unterversorgung mit Telefoninfrastruktur in ländlichen Regionen als das Kernproblem identifiziert und en detail diskutiert. Dabei werden die für Polen spezifischen Markt- und Regulierungsbedingungen untersucht sowie Politikempfehlungen formuliert, die speziell eine Verbesserung der Flächendeckung mit Telefonanschlüssen auf dem Land zum Ziel haben.

Science Policy under Thatcher,Jon Agar,political_science,First published in 2019,/works/OL20927645W,/authors/OL91392A/Jon_Agar,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  UCL Press|Language English|Pages 304,"Margaret Thatcher was prime minister from 1979 to 1990, during which time her Conservative administration transformed the political landscape of Britain. Science Policy under Thatcher is the first book to examine systematically the interplay of science and government under her leadership.    Thatcher was a working scientist before she became a professional politician, and she maintained a close watch on science matters as prime minister. Scientific knowledge and advice were important to many urgent issues of the 1980s, from late Cold War questions of defence to emerging environmental problems such as acid rain and climate change. Drawing on newly released primary sources, Jon Agar explores how Thatcher worked with and occasionally against the structures of scientific advice, as the scientific aspects of such issues were balanced or conflicted with other demands and values. To what extent, for example, was the freedom of the individual scientist to choose research projects balanced against the desire to secure more commercial applications? What was Thatcher?s stance towards European scientific collaboration and commitments? How did cuts in public expenditure affect the publicly funded research and teaching of universities?    In weaving together numerous topics, including AIDS and bioethics, the nuclear industry and strategic defence, Agar adds to the picture we have of Thatcher and her radically Conservative agenda, and argues that the science policy devised under her leadership, not least in relation to industrial strategy, had a prolonged influence on the culture of British science.

This book is the first detailed inquiry into what has been a neglected but critically important trend: the growing links between Russian actors and Western far right activists, publicists, ideologues, and politicians. The author uses a range of sources including interviews, video footage, leaked communications, official statements and press coverage in order to discuss both historical and contemporary Russia in terms of its relationship with the Western far right.  Initial contacts between Russian political actors and Western far right activists were established in the early 1990s, but these contacts were low profile. As Moscow has become more anti-Western, these contacts have become more intense and have operated at a higher level. The book shows that the Russian establishment was first interested in using the Western far right to legitimise Moscow’s politics and actions both domestically and internationally, but more recently Moscow has begun to support particular far right political forces to gain leverage on European politics and undermine the liberal-democratic consensus in the West.  Contributing to ongoing scholarly debates about Russia’s role in the world, its strategies aimed at securing legitimation of Putin’s regime both internationally and domestically, modern information warfare and propaganda, far right politics and activism in the West, this book draws on theories and methods from history, political science, area studies, and media studies and will be of interest to students, scholars, activists and practitioners in these areas.

Although the macroeconomics of effective market adjustment evolved in a similar way, the patterns of compensation delivered by neoliberal governments, and the type of actors in business and the working class that benefited from them, were remarkably different. Based on the policy-making styles and the compensatory measures employed to make market transitions politically viable, the book distinguishes three alternative models: Statist, Corporatist, and Market. Sebastian Etchemendy argues that the most decisive factors that shape adjustment paths are the type of regime and the economic and organizational power with which business and labor emerged from the inward-oriented model. The analysis spans from the origins of state, business and labor industrial actors in the 1930s and 1940s to the politics of compensation under neoliberalism across the Ibero-American world, combined with extensive field work material on Spain, Argentina, and Chile""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Soon after they agree to put up Frank's old friend Haynes, who is on the lam from a secret government project involving plutonium, they're visited by Welch, an unctuous government bureaucrat from hell. His aggressive patriotism puts Frank, Emma, and Haynes on the defensive, transforming a heartland American household into a scene of torture and promoting a radioactive brand of conformity with a dangerously long half life.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Since 1789 the far right has been an important factor in French political life and in different eras has taken on a range of guises including traditionalism, ultra-royalism, radical nationalism, anti-Semitism and fascism.This book is structured around the five main phases of extreme right activity, and the author explores key questions about each:* Counter-revolution - what was the legacy of Joseph de Maistre's writings? Anti-Third Republic protest - how was the 'new right' of the 1880s and 1890s different from the 'old right' of previous decades? Inter-war fascism - how should we characterise the phenomenon of fascisme francaise? Vichy - why did Petain and Laval collaborate with the Nazis? the  Post-war far right - what is the relationship between Poujadism, Alg'erie Fran,caise and Le Pen's FN?The Extreme Right in France, 1789 to the Present provides the key to an understanding of this vivid and long-standing feature of France's political history, with its amazing ability to reinvent itself and to appeal anew to important sections of the French population.

What if casual conversations revolved around Fox News and the decline of American values? How would you feel if you were afraid to put a political bumper sticker on your car or had to think twice about what liberal posts you liked on Facebook? These are just some of the experiences shared by liberals across twenty states and five time zones who tell their stories with honesty, warmth, and humor. Most of us have to ""talk across the aisle"" once or twice a year--when we're seated next to our conservative out-of-town uncle at Thanksgiving, say. But millions of self- identified liberals live in cities and towns--particularly away from the East and West Coasts--where they are regularly outnumbered and outvoted by conservatives. In this uplifting and completely original book, Justin Krebs, the founder of the national Living Liberally network, speaks with and tells the stories of atheists, vegetarians, environmentalists, pacifists, and old-fashioned liberals--a term he is intent on rehabilitating--from Texas to Idaho, South Carolina to Alaska. Krebs weaves these stories together to create a provocative and rollicking taxonomy of strategies for living in a diverse society, with lessons for every participant in our great democratic experiment.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Does anyone really think that politics is working--aside from those in power and behind it? Living in peace and harmony is a more natural condition than what we experience in today's conflict-driven world. We are community animals with built-in empathy, organizing best from the bottom up. The most essential and reliable features of our culture arose without top-down planning by a state that has one basic objective--to stay in power. The State Is Out of Date reassures us that politics is not the primary game in town, though it may sometimes look like the only one. This is a book for anyone who wonders why politics isn't working and what would. ""Chaos theory"" offers an alternative to government: things self-organizing into working and stable systems, inexplicably organized from the bottom up. We see the consequences that top down control and regulation has had upon our food chain, the health of the nation and its citizens, the liabilities of corporations, our personal security, and the next generation's education. They're not doing a very good job.What can we do? Where can we go from here? The State Is Out of Date puts us on the right track by pointing peacefully forward rather than backwards.

Subsequently, the book investigates the conditions under which post-accession liberalisation comes to a halt in countries once praised by the Democratisation and Europeanization literatures for their pace of reform. Particular emphasis is on the comparative aspects of research, placing Hungary in context amongst the new EU member states such as Poland, Slovenia, and Slovakia and examining trends over time.

This is especially true in developed nations, where in some societies nonbelievers now outnumber believers. Unless religion collapses completely, or undergoes a remarkable resurgence, countries across the globe must learn to carefully and effectively manage this societal mix of religious and irreligious. For in a world already deeply riven by sectarian conflict, this unprecedented demographic shift presents yet another challenge to humanity. Writing in an engaging, accessible style, philosopher and lawyer Ronald A. Lindsay develops a tightly crafted argument for secularism--specifically, that in a religiously pluralistic society, a robust, thoroughgoing secularism is the only reliable means of preserving meaningful democracy and rights of conscience. Contrary to certain political pundits and religious leaders who commonly employ the term secularism as a scare word, Lindsay uses clear, concrete examples and jargon-free language to demonstrate that secularism is the only way to ensure equal respect and protection under the law--for believers and nonbelievers alike. Although critical of some aspects of religion, Lindsay neither presents an antireligious tirade nor seeks to convert anyone to nonbelief, reminding us that secularism and atheism are not synonymous. Rather, he shows how secularism works to everyone's benefit and makes the definitive case that the secular model should be feared by none--and embraced by all""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These applications have led many to compare the blockchain to the Internet, with accompanying predictions that this technology will shift the balance of power away from centralized authorities in the field of communications, business, and even politics or law. Blockchain and the Law explores the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argues that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of what we term lex cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts.--   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Les partis politiques en France,Pascal Delwit,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL20927241W,/authors/OL60572A/Pascal_Delwit,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Editions de l'Université de Bruxelles|Pages 252,"Like European political parties, French political parties face a number of challenges and are subject to many tensions at the dawn of the twenty-first century, even though their attractiveness has never seemed so low. arrangement around the Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF) on the right, and the Socialist Party (PS) and the French Communist Party (PCF) on the left, the party system itself has even considerably evolved under the effect of the recomposition of the parliamentary right, the collapse of the Communist Party or the breakthrough of newcomers, such as the National Front or the Greens. After the sequence of presidential and legislative elections of 2012, this book analyzes in depth the state of each of the active parties in the political system. How does each of them position themselves in relation to the transformations of partisan activity? How do parties interpret the mutations they face? How do they deal with the disaffection they experience? What ideological and organizational evolutions do they know? These issues are discussed in this reference book. The authors present an original overall picture, systematically offering a party analysis at work in the French political system; which is completed by a reflection on the major transformations of the electoral geography.  À l’instar des formations politiques européennes, les partis politiques français sont confrontés à plusieurs défis et soumis à nombre de tensions à l’aube de ce XXIe siècle, alors même que leur attractivité n’a jamais semblé aussi faible.Longtemps dominée par un agencement autour du Rassemblement pour la République (RPR) et de l’Union pour la démocratie française (UDF) à droite, et du parti socialiste (PS) et du parti communiste français (PCF) à gauche, le système de partis a lui-même considérablement évolué sous l’effet de la recomposition de la droite parlementaire, de l’effondrement du parti communiste ou de la percée de nouveaux venus, tels le Front national ou Les Verts. Après la séquence des élections présidentielles et législatives de 2012, cet ouvrage analyse en profondeur l’état de chacun des partis actifs dans le système politique. Comment chacun d’entre eux se positionne-t-il au regard des transformations du fait partisan ? Comment les partis interprètent-ils les mutations auxquelles ils font face ? Comment agissent-ils face à la désaffection qu’ils subissent ? Quelles évolutions idéologiques et organisationnelles connaissent-ils ? Ces questions sont examinées dans ce livre de référence. Les auteurs présentent un tableau d’ensemble original, offrant de manière systématique une analyse des partis à l’œuvre dans le système politique français ; laquelle est complétée par une réflexion sur les grandes transformations de la géographie électorale.

The Dilemmas of Engagement,Jenny Stewart,political_science,First published in 2009,/works/OL20933092W,/authors/OL616235A/Jenny_Stewart,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  ANU Press|Pages 85,"‘Consultation’ has become something of a mantra in contemporary governance. Governments well understand that policy occurs in a highly contestable environment in which there are multiple, and often competing interests. They well recognise the political imperative to ‘engage’ stakeholders in order to manage potential conflict and, hopefully, obtain acceptance for their policies and programs. As a result, politicians and public officials frequently emphasise the need for consultation as an essential element of the deliberative processes underpinning the development of policy or the implementation of programs and services. But, moving beyond the rhetoric of consultation and engagement, how well is it done? In this monograph, Professor Jenny Stewart maps out the principal approaches used by governments to consult with and engage affected communities of interest. Stewart critically assesses the available literature and draws directly upon the experiences of political actors, bureaucrats and community sector organisations in order to identify the ‘good, bad, and the ugly’ of engagement. Through a judicious use of selected case studies, Stewart distils the essential dilemmas and contradictions inherent in many consultation strategies and highlights their relative strengths and weaknesses. This monograph is a probing and dispassionate analysis of the rationales, methodologies and outcomes of consultation and engagement. It is not intended to be a ‘cookbook’ or a ‘how to’ manual for those consulting or the consulted. Nevertheless, there is much here for the policy practitioner, the researcher and members of those ‘communities of interest’ who might, one day, find themselves the target of engagement.

Moeglichkeiten zur Fortsetzung der Gemeindefinanzreform,Grete Albers,political_science,First published in 1986,/works/OL23498162W,/authors/OL8908157A/Grete_Albers,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1986|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 327,"Das bestehende Gefüge kommunaler Steuern mit der Gewerbesteuer als einem Eckpfeiler des Gemeindesteuersystems wird essentiellen Besteuerungsgrundsätzen nicht gerecht, so dass eine Reform unausweichlich erscheint. Dabei stellt sich die Frage, ob es zweckmässig ist, die Gewerbesteuer durch eine Wertschöpfungsteuer oder eine allgemeine Verbrauchsteuer zu ersetzen. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht auf der Grundlage zweier Sonderauswertungen der Statistischen Landesämter Schleswig-Holstein und Hessen für das Jahr 1978 u.a., inwieweit die (partielle) Substitution der Gewerbesteuer durch eine Wertschöpfung- oder (und) eine Verbrauchsteuer die Verteilung der Steueraufbringungskraft innerhalb und zwischen Gemeindegrössenklassen verändert.

Ten Global Trends Every Smart Person Should Know,Ronald Bailey,political_science,First published in 2020,/works/OL21874583W,/authors/OL575718A/Ronald_Bailey,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Cato Institute|Language English|Pages 197,"Think the world is getting worse? You're wrong: the world is, for the most part, not getting worse. But 58 percent of folks in 17 countries that were surveyed in 2016 thought the world is either getting worse or staying the same rather than getting better. Americans were even more glum: 65 percent thought the world is getting worse and only 6 percent thought it was getting better. The uncontroversial data on major global trends in this book will persuade you that this dark view of the prospects for humanity and the natural world is, in large part, badly mistaken. World population will peak at 8 to 9 billion before the end of this century as the global fertility rate continues its fall from 6 children per woman in 1960 to the current rate of 2.4. The global absolute poverty rate has fallen from 42 percent in 1981 to 8.6 percent today. Satellite data show that forest area has been expanding since 1982. Natural resources are becoming ever cheaper and more abundant. Since 1900, the average life expectancy has more than doubled, reaching more than 72 years. Of course, major concerns such as climate change, marine plastic pollution, and declining wildlife populations are still with us, but many of these problems are already in the process of being ameliorated as a result of the favorable economic, social, and technological trends that are documented in this book.

Studies in Law and Politics,Harold Laski,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL21357319W,/authors/OL8174141A/Harold_Laski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""The essays that comprise Studies in Law and Politics are by and large academic. But Laski had a purpose in addition to the purely scholarly: he was eagerly pursuing possibilities for social and political change. Laski sought tirelessly for opportunities to act on those possibilities and, as is the case throughout his work, his academic and political purposes have no clear boundary between them. Studies in Law of Politics was published at a crucial juncture in Laski's ideological metamorphosis. During this period he had become increasingly worried that socialists might not be able to achieve the growth of working-class power. Although the essays contained in the volume cover a wide range of topics, and a wide span of time since the mid-1920s, he brought them into unity by a common approach. Though he does not make his unifying premise immediately evident to his readers, he clearly meant to chart the growth of power of those who had previously been without influence. His goal also was to identify the problems facing growth in a highly modernized society. Studies in Law and Politics reveals Laski's growing realization that the road to socialism might be more difficult than what he had believed when he wrote his pluralist works. The book reflects the mind of a thinker who was not content to write exclusively as an academic or a political activist. His view was that, while progressive reforms have been achieved in the past, they are not easily accomplished, and obstacles to further reforms should not be underestimated. This sober work offers much insight into Laski's intellectual development, as well as the times about which he wrote.""--Provided by publisher.

In The Muslim Question in Europe, Peter O'Brien challenges the popular notion that the hostilities concerning immigration—which continues to provoke debates about citizenship, headscarves, secularism, and terrorism—are a clash between ""Islam and the West."" Rather, he explains, the vehement controversies surrounding European Muslims are better understood as persistent, unresolved intra-Europeantensions.  O'Brien contends that the best way to understand the politics of state accommodation of European Muslims is through the lens of three competing political ideologies: liberalism, nationalism, and postmodernism. These three broadly understood philosophical traditions represent the most influential normative forces in the politics of immigration in Europe today. He concludes that Muslim Europeans do not represent a monolithic anti-Western bloc within Europe. Although they vehemently disagree among themselves, it is along the same basic liberal, nationalist, and postmodern contours as non-Muslim Europeans.

This first volume, The Roots of Terrorism, examines the underlying causes of terrorism and details concrete measures for addressing them. The study of these roots and risk factors of terrorism needs to be an essential component of any counter-terrorist strategy. If we do not understand the challenge we face, how can we ever hope to thwart it? The essays-written by some of the world's leading experts on terrorism-will cover the psychological, political, religious, economic and cultural factors that can contribute to the rise of terrorist movements and motivate individual terrorists.       Analyzing the threat and where it comes from, The Roots of Terrorism not only    examines what makes terrorists tick, but also what can be done to prevent their emergence. While many have explored the conscious and sub-conscious motivations of terrorists, few have spelled out what policymakers in liberal democracies can do to address these concerns. These essay, thus, represent not only the state of the art in the study of the causes of terrorism, but are uniquely practical in their approach. Contributors include: Jerrold Post, Martha Crenshaw, Tedd Gurr, Mark Jeurgensmeyer, John Esposito, and Jessica Stern and many others.

Beyond the global culture war,Adam Kempton Webb,political_science,First published in 2006,/works/OL13664379W?edition=ia%3Abeyondglobalcult00webb_442,/authors/OL6520029A/Adam_Kempton_Webb,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24275878M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"Beyond the Global Culture War is a broad-ranging political, historical, and philosophical account of the clash between liberal modernity and the forces that resist it. The book starts by identifying four ethoses, or self-understandings, that have contended in all civilizations through history. It shows that liberal modernity amounts to an upending of history, the disruptive rise of one of those four ethoses to unprecedented dominance in public culture. In its first third, the book traces how the ethos that underlies liberalism managed to break past age-old checks on it, through a series of ideological maneuvers between the late nineteenth and mid twentieth centuries. Then it turns to the global culture war today. On one side is the liberal vision of an ""end of history,"" of markets, moral relativism, and technocratic rule. On the other is the strident backlash from Islamists, populists, the Christian Right, Chinese and Hindu nationalists, and the like.The book argues that    today's resistance is doomed to fail for two reasons. First, all versions of it are insular, and lack the universal appeal that would let them meet global liberal culture on its own scale. Second, they have a peculiar moralizing flatness that means they cannot draw on the rich high-culture currents of the past civilizations they claim to defend. The book's final chapters lay out an alternative vision of a truly cosmopolitan and multidimensional challenge to the global liberal order. That vision involves a partnership between plain folk and virtue-cultivating strata, to avert history's dead-end and forge a post-liberal global polity. The book is distinctive in its cross-cultural breadth, covering issues from Western and non-Western settings, both pre-modern and modern. It also stakes out an original intellectual and political position: critical of capitalism and technocracy, sympathetic to traditional virtues and the legacies of past civilizations, and avowedly cosmopolitan in scope and vision.

Such alienation is unhealthy, as it threatens both sufficient civilian control of the military and the long-standing ideal of the citizen soldier. Nowhere is this issue more predominant than at many major universities, which began turning their backs on the military during the chaotic years of the Vietnam War. Arms and the University probes various dimensions of this alienation, as well recent efforts to restore a closer relationship between the military and the university. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, Donald Alexander Downs and Ilia Murtazashvili show how a military presence on campus in the form of ROTC (including a case study of ROTC,♯s̥ return to Columbia and Harvard universities), military history, and national security studies can enhance the civic and liberal education of non-military students, and in the process help to bridge the civil-military gap""-- Provided by publisher.

This book explores the critical role that local knowledge plays in public policy processes as well as its role in the co-production of policy relevant knowledge with the scientific and professional communities.    The authors consider the mechanisms used by local organisations and the constraints and opportunities they face, exploring what the knowledge-to-policy process means, who is involved and how different communities can engage in the policy process.     Ten diverse case studies are used from around Indonesia, addressing issues such as forest management, water resources, maritime resource management and financial services. By making extensive use of quotes from the field, the book allows the reader to ?hear? the perspectives and beliefs of community members around local knowledge and its effects on individual and community life.""

Am Beispiel der Regionalpolitik in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern untersucht die Arbeit die institutionellen Strukturen in Europa und Deutschland. Regionalpolitik wird durch konstruktivistische Politikkonzeptionen geprägt und im Rahmen eines verflochtenen politischen Systems geplant und implementiert. Dies führt zur Zentralisierung der Entscheidungskompetenzen, zu massivem rent-seeking-Verhalten und somit zur ineffizienten Allokation knapper Mittel. Durch eine ordnungspolitische Reform der Regionalpolitik, die Entscheidungskompetenzen radikal dezentralisiert, könnte ihre Effektivität erheblich erhöht werden.

Eine Analyse zeigt, daß diesen Vermeidungsstrategien mit den bestehenden Steuergesetzen nicht ausreichend begegnet werden kann.

Dynamics of Power in Dutch Integration Politics,Justus Uitermark,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL21471539W,/authors/OL7342405A/Justus_Uitermark,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Amsterdam University Press|Pages 256,"Integration politics in the Netherlands has changed dramatically between 1990 and 2005. Whereas ethnic and religious differences were hitherto pacified through accommodation, a new and increasingly powerful current in Dutch politics problematized the presence of minorities. This development represents a challenge to sociologists and political scientists: how to map and explain drastic changes? Arguing that extant approaches are better at explaining continuity than change, this book develops a relational discourse analysis to understand dynamic power relations in national as well as local politics.  De manier waarop integratie, moslims en minderheden werd besproken en bestuurd veranderde drastisch tussen 1990 en 2005. Maar hoe veranderde het integratiedebat precies, en waarom? En hoe werkten die veranderingen door in het beleid van steden als Amsterdam en Rotterdam? Dit boek gebruikt nieuwe methodes en data om die vragen te beantwoorden. Een analyse van opinieartikelen laat zien dat culturalisten (debatdeelnemers die stellen dat onze 'verlichte', 'liberale', Nederlandse cultuur moet worden beschermd tegen etnische en Islamitische minderheidsculturen) hechtere relaties onderhouden en meer achter hun leiders staan dan hun (talrijke maar gefragmenteerde) tegenstanders. De veranderende machtsverhoudingen in het debat blijken niet één op één door te werken in het lokale beleid. In de periode dat Leefbaar Rotterdam de gemeenteraad domineerde (2002-2006) zijn migrantenorganisaties over de hele linie eerder versterkt dan verzwakt. In het door de sociaal-democraten gedomineerde Amsterdam daarentegen had slechts een klein aantal organisaties invloed en toegang tot subsidies. Dynamics of Power in Dutch Integration Politics gaat niet alleen in op deze verrassende resultaten maar ontwikkelt ook een theoretische aanpak - gebaseerd op het werk van Jeffrey Alexander, Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Collins en Norbert Elias - waarmee snelle politieke omwentelingen kunnen worden ontleed en verklaard. Dit boek is gebaseerd op een proefschrift dat cum laude werd beoordeeld en beloond met de Jaarprijs Politicologie 2011 en de internationale Maria Ioannis Baganha Dissertation Award 2011.

For centuries, farmers in the Basin have regarded rice as “white gold”, reflecting its centrality to their food security and well-being. In the past four decades, rice has also become a commercial crop of great importance to Mekong farmers, augmenting but not replacing its role in securing their subsistence. This book is based on collaborative research to (a) compare the current situation and trajectories of rice farmers within and between different regions of the Lower Mekong, (b) explore the value chains linking rice farmers with new technologies and input and output markets within and across national borders, and (c) understand the changing role of government policies in facilitating the on-going evolution of commercial rice farming. An introductory section places the research in geographical and historical context. Four major sections deal in turn with studies of rice farming, value chains, and policies in Northeast Thailand, Central Laos, Southeastern Cambodia, and the Mekong Delta. The final section examines the implications for rice policy in the region as a whole.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Es wird gezeigt, daß die Wahl des optimalen Wechselkurssystems von der relativen Gewichtung der beiden Zielsetzungen «Aufrechterhaltung der internationalen Wettbewerbsfähigkeit» und «makroökonomische Stabilisierung» sowie dem Offenheitsgrad der Volkswirtschaft abhängt. Den Ergebnissen der theoretischen Analyse werden die Erfahrungen der zehn mittel- und osteuropäischen EU-Beitrittskandidaten gegenübergestellt.

The Anarchist Imagination: Anarchism Encounters the Humanities and the Social Sciences,Carl Levy,political_science,First published in 2019,/works/OL20077662W,/authors/OL2466066A/Carl_Levy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27257667M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 265,"This is a broad ranging introduction to twenty-first-century anarchism which includes a wide array of theoretical approaches as well as a variety of empirical and geographical perspectives. The book demonstrates how the anarchist imagination has influenced the humanities and social sciences including anthropology, art, feminism, geography, international relations, political science, postcolonialism, and sociology.  Drawing on a long historical narrative that encompasses the 'waves' of anarchist movements from the classical anarchists (1840s to 1940s), post-war wave of student, counter-cultural and workers' control anarchism of the 1960s and 1970s to the DIY politics and Temporary Autonomous Zones of the 1990s right up to the Occupy! Movement and beyond, the aim of this volume is to cover the humanities and the social sciences in an era of anarchist revival in academia. Anarchist philosophy and anarchistic methodologies have re-emerged in a range of disciplines from Organization Studies, to Law, to Political Economy to Political Theory and International Relations, and Anthropology to Cultural Studies. Anarchist approaches to freedom, democracy, ethics, violence, authority, punishment, homelessness, and the arbitration of justice have spawned a broad array of academic publications and research projects. But this volume remembers an older story, in other words, the continuous role of the anarchist imagination as muse, provocateur, goading adversary, and catalyst in the stimulation of research and creative activity in the humanities and social sciences from the middle of the nineteenth century to today.  This work will be essential reading for scholars and students of anarchism, the humanities, and the social sciences.

This book fills a gap in the literature on violent conflict, evaluating a region that contains all the modern ingredients for instability and aggression. Bringing together leading experts on war and security, the book addresses current debates in international relations about power, interests, globalisation, and the politics of identity as major drivers of contemporary war. Incidents such as the 2008 Russo-Georgian conflict, the wars in Chechnya, and Russia's struggles over national identity and resources with the Ukraine and Moldova over the Crimea and the Trans-Dneister are all thoroughly examined. With new issues like energy security, terrorism and transnational crime, and older tensions between East and West threatening to deepen once more, this is an important contribution to the international security literature""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This new generation, formed primarily by people who in the late 1960s were still under the age of thirty, challenged traditional politics and embraced organized violence and transnational strategies as the only ways of achieving social change in their countries during the Cold War. This lasted for more than a decade, beginning in Uruguay as a result of the rise of authoritarianism in Brazil and Argentina, and expanding with Che Guevara's Bolivia campaign in 1966. These coordination efforts reached their highest point in Buenos Aires from 1973 to 1976, until the military coup d'etat in Argentina eliminated the last refuge for these groups. Aldo Marchesi offers the first in-depth, regional and transnational study of the militant left in Latin America during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.

The crime resonated deeply with America's bitter history of violence against minorities, and something about Matt Shepard himself struck a chord with people across the nation. Although the details of the tragedy are familiar to most people, the complex and ever-shifting context of the killing is not. ""Losing Matt Shepard"" explores why the murder still haunts us--and why it should.  Beth Loffreda is uniquely qualified to write this account. As a professor new to the state and a straight faculty advisor to the campus Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Association, she is both an insider and outsider to the events. She draws upon her own penetrating observations as well as dozens of interviews with students, townspeople, police officers, journalists, state politicians, activists, and gay and lesbian residents to make visible the knot of forces tied together by the fate of this young man.  This book shows how the politics of sexuality--perhaps now the most divisive issue in America's culture wars--unfolds in a remote and sparsely populated area of the country. Loffreda brilliantly captures daily life since October 1998 in Laramie, Wyoming--a community in a rural, poor, conservative, and breathtakingly beautiful state without a single gay bar or bookstore. Rather than focus only on Matt Shepard, she presents a full range of characters, including a panoply of locals (both gay and straight), the national gay activists who quickly descended on Laramie, the indefatigable homicide investigators, the often unreflective journalists of the national media, and even a cameo appearance by Peter, Paul, and Mary.  Loffreda courses through a wide ambit of events: from the attempts by students and townspeople to rise above the anti-gay theatrics of defrocked minister Fred Phelps to the spontaneous, grassroots support for Matt at the university's homecoming parade, from the emotionally charged town council discussions about bias crimes legislation to the tireless efforts of the investigators to trace that grim night's trail of evidence. Charting these and many other events, ""Losing Matt Shepard"" not only recounts the typical responses to Matt's death but also the surprising stories of those whose lives were transformed but ignored in the media frenzy.

And yet, six years later, she has reemerged as an even more powerful and influential figure, a formidable stateswoman and the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, marking one of the great political comebacks in history. The story of Hillary's phoenixlike rise is at the heart of HRC, a riveting political biography that journeys into the heart of ""Hillaryland"" to discover a brilliant strategist at work. Masterfully unfolded by Politico's Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes from more than two hundred top-access interviews with Hillary's intimates, colleagues, supporters, and enemies, HRC portrays a seasoned operator who negotiates political and diplomatic worlds with equal savvy. Loathed by the Obama team in the wake of the primary, Hillary worked to become the president's greatest ally, their fates intertwined in the work of reestablishing America on the world stage. HRC puts readers in the room with Hillary during the most intense and pivotal moments of this era, as she mulls the president-elect's offer to join the administration, pulls the strings to build a coalition for his war against Libya, and scrambles to deal with the fallout from the terrible events in Benghazi--all while keeping one eye focused on 2016. HRC offers a rare look inside the merciless Clinton political machine, as Bill Clinton handled the messy business of avenging Hillary's primary loss while she tried to remain above the partisan fray. Exploring her friendships and alliances with Robert Gates, David Petraeus, Leon Panetta, Joe Biden, and the president himself, Allen and Parnes show how Hillary fundamentally transformed the State Department through the force of her celebrity and her unparalleled knowledge of how power works in Washington. Filled with deep reporting and Game Change-esque storytelling, this remarkable portrait of the most important female politician in American history is an essential inside look at the woman who may be our next president""--  ""An examination of the strategy behind Hillary Clinton's political revitalization and her comeback in the US and abroad""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The European Union and military force,Per M.

In this insightful work, Per M. Norheim-Martinsen argues that, since the EU is not a state but nevertheless does embody some non-intergovernmental characteristics, neither EU studies nor strategic studies is sufficient for fully understanding the Policy itself. Combining the two fields, the author utilises the instrumentality and clarity of the strategic approach, while retaining an understanding of the unique character of the EU as a strategic actor. In so doing, he provides a fruitful conceptual framework for analysing the development of the CSDP, how it functions in practice and how it will continue to evolve in the face of the challenges which lie ahead. This book will appeal to scholars and advanced students of European studies, international relations and strategic studies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As always, Chomsky presents his ideas vividly and accessibly, with uncompromising principle and clarifying insight.

Esta perspectiva, central en la teoría clásica y en gran medida arrinconada por tendencias posteriores, constituye el punto de partida de Modelos de partido. Utilizando aportaciones que pertenecen a diversas tradiciones disciplinares, Angelo Panebianco lleva a cabo una investigación histórico-comparada de las vicisitudes de un cierto número de partidos políticos europeos. Avanza nuevas hipótesis sobre la relación entre partidos y entorno, sobre el fenómeno de la burocratización y sobre los factores políticos en juego en las transformaciones organizativas de los partidos.

Die mit der Erweiterung einhergehende zunehmende Heterogenität der ökonomischen Strukturen innerhalb der Europäischen Union lässt auf eine gleichermaßen zunehmende Pluralität der politischen Interessen der Mitgliedstaaten schließen, so dass in der erweiterten Union unter Umständen andere Interessen dominieren und andere einflussreiche Ländergruppen existieren können als dies in der alten EU der Fall war. Für ausgewählte Politikbereiche zeigt die empirische Analyse, dass sich in der erweiterten Europäischen Union verschiedene Ländergruppen mit relativ heterogenen politischen Interessen gegenüberstehen, wodurch der politische Entscheidungsprozess auf europäischer Ebene durch die Erweiterung aller Voraussicht nach deutlich erschwert werden wird.

Powers chronicles this forced march toward conformity in an expose; of the illiberal tactics deployed to shut down debate on some of the most important issues of the day. How is it that liberalism, once associated with open-mindedness and reason, has become a vehicle for irrational prejudice, ideological conformity, and the marginalization of dissent?

Bullying is an urgent topic on many minds and lips today. After the ""It Gets Better"" program was sanctioned by Obama himself, the left turned bullying into one of its most beloved pet issues. But what they seem to have missed is that their own modus operandi relies on exactly that: bullying. Bullying is the liberals' go-to tactic. They decry their opponents through fear, threat of force, and rhetorical intimidation on every major issue facing America. Anti-American bullies portray our country as a force for evil in the world, a great maw of global nastiness, chewing up portions of our population on behalf of their corporate overlords. Race bullies like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson incite riots ending in murder, trump up charges against innocent district attorneys, or threaten violence to small towns in Florida, while calling anyone who disagrees with them racists. And there's much, much more. These are the most despicable people in America. And what makes them even more vile is that as they bully their opponents, they claim to be victims. They call their opponents uncivil while engaging in some of the most vulgar tactics against anyone they disagree with. But no more. Political prodigy and editor-in-chief of Breitbart.com Ben Shapiro takes on these bullies and provides a compelling tour of the left's bullying tendencies on all of today's top political issues""--  ""From the editor-at-large of Breitbart.com, a timely and compelling look at how liberals use bullying toward their opponents on today's top political issues""--   Read more Read less",10 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Vinson, an Air Force Sergeant with a crypto-security clearance. In 1963 Sergeant Vinson was working for the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). On November 22 he personally and accidentally became involved in an activity connected with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The involvement of elements of the CIA are clearly set forth including the forced transfer of Vinson to a secret CIA base in Nevada called Site (Area) 51. Compelled to remain silent due to a secrecy agreement, Vinson went public after the passage of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) Act in 1993. Finding it impossible to obtain assistance from government agencies including the FBI and Department of Justice, this book is his story.

These trends mirror the experience of the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. Reinventing Collapse examines the circumstances of the demise of the Soviet superpower and offers clear insights into how we might prepare for coming events.  Rather than focusing on doom and gloom, Reinventing Collapse suggests that there is room for optimism if we focus our efforts on personal and cultural transformation. With characteristic dry humor, Dmitry Orlov identifies three progressive stages of response to the looming crisis:  Mitigation—alleviating the impact of the coming upheaval Adaptation—adjusting to the reality of changed conditions Opportunity—flourishing after the collapse He argues that by examining maladaptive parts of our common cultural baggage, we can survive, thrive, and discover more meaningful and fulfilling lives, in spite of steadily deteriorating circumstances.  This challenging yet inspiring work is a must-read for anyone concerned about energy, geopolitics, international relations, and life in a post-Peak Oil world.

Leo Strauss and His Catholic Readers,Geoffrey M.

It will be of particular interest to Catholics and scholars of other religious traditions. Strauss had a great deal of interaction with his contemporary Catholic scholars, and many of his students or their students teach or have taught at Catholic colleges and universities in America. Leo Strauss and His Catholic Readers brings together work by scholars from two continents, some of whom knew Strauss, one of whom was his student at the University of Chicago. The first section of essays considers Catholic responses to Strauss's project of recovering Classical natural right as against modern individual rights. Some of the authors suggest that his approach can be a fruitful corrective to an uncritical reception of modern ideas. Nevertheless, most point out that the Catholic cannot accept all of Strauss's project. The second section deals with areas of overlap between Strauss and Catholics. Some of the chapters explore encounters with his contemporary scholars while others turn to more current concerns. The final section approaches the theological-political question itself, a question central to both Strauss's work and that of the Catholic intellectual tradition. This section of the book considers the relationship of Strauss's work to Christianity and Christian commitments at a broader level. Because Christianity does not have an explicit political doctrine, Christians have found themselves as rulers, subjects, and citizens in a variety of political regimes. Leo Strauss's return to Platonic political philosophy can provide a useful lens through which his Catholic readers can assess what it means for there to be a best regime.

The end of greatness,Aaron David Miller,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL19986557W,/authors/OL1187889A/Aaron_David_Miller,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English|Pages 280,"""There is one thing that has haunted all of America's modern presidents: Americans' expectations of greatness in the man and the office. While it was impossible for the Framers of the Constitution to predict the circumstances that would make America the greatest and most consequential power on Earth, the Founders never intended this spotlight on the presidency. Venerating our past great presidents has always been safe, compelling, and inspiring. But when it also tempts us with the possibilities of their return, it may not be so benign. The End of Greatness offers a new way to appreciate and evaluate the presidency, a mode of understanding that gives conventional achievement ratings their place but ultimately makes the counterintuitive argument that, in expecting greatness, we have made goodness simply impossible. This book looks at the concept of greatness in presidents--the ways in which it is essential to a nation and the ways in which it has been detrimental. Miller argues that greatness in presidents is an overrated virtue, one that eclipses--and perhaps even thwarts--the real contributions of our presidents""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It covers a wide range of countries and cultures from advanced Western democracies and beyond. The research tools employed include quantitative and qualitative content analyses, comparative case studies, document analysis, opinion surveys, elite interviews and a combination of various methods. Employing different research strategies and theoretical approaches, this book sheds new light on key concepts in the literature on comparative political communication research, such as professionalization, personalization and globalization. It also investigates processes of change and transformation, such as negativization of campaigns, internationalization of campaign coverage, professionalization of government communication, democratization, commercialization of the media and transnationalization of national public spheres.

Alter egos,Mark Landler,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20028263W?edition=ia%3Aalteregoshillary0000land,/authors/OL7607882A/Mark_Landler,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27208312M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Random House|Language English|Pages 406,"""The deeply reported story of two supremely ambitious figures, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton--archrivals who became partners for a time, trailblazers who share a common sense of their historic destiny but hold very different beliefs about how to project American power. In Alter Egos, veteran New York Times White House correspondent Mark Landler takes us inside the fraught and fascinating relationship between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton--a relationship that has framed the nation's great debates over war and peace for the past eight years. In the annals of American statecraft, theirs was a most unlikely alliance. Clinton, daughter of an anticommunist father, was raised in the Republican suburbs of Chicago in the aftermath of World War II, nourishing an unshakable belief in the United States as a force for good in distant lands. Obama, an itinerant child of the 1970s, was raised by a single mother in Indonesia and Hawaii, suspended between worlds and a witness to the less savory side of Uncle Sam's influence abroad. Clinton and Obama would later come to embody competing visions of America's role in the world: his, restrained, inward-looking, painfully aware of limits; hers, hard-edged, pragmatic, unabashedly old-fashioned. Spanning the arc of Obama's two terms, Alter Egosgoes beyond the speeches and press conferences to the Oval Office huddles and South Lawn strolls, where Obama and Clinton pressed their views. It follows their evolution from bitter rivals to wary partners, and then to something resembling rivals again, as Clinton defined herself anew and distanced herself from her old boss. In the process, it counters the narrative that, during her years as secretary of state, there was no daylight between them, that the wounds of the 2008 campaign had been entirely healed. The president and his chief diplomat parted company over some of the biggest issues of the day: how quickly to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; whether to arm the rebels in Syria; how to respond to the upheaval in Egypt; and whether to trust the Russians. In Landler's gripping account, we venture inside the Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, watch Obama and Clinton work in tandem to salvage a conference on climate change in Copenhagen, and uncover the secret history of their nuclear diplomacy with Iran--a story with a host of fresh disclosures. With the grand sweep of history and the pointillist detail of an account based on insider access--the book draws on exclusive interviews with more than one hundred senior administration officials, foreign diplomats, and friends of Obama and Clinton--Mark Landler offers the definitive account of a complex, profoundly important relationship. As Barack Obama prepares to relinquish the presidency, and Hillary Clinton makes perhaps her last bid for it, how both regard American power is a central question of our time. Advance praise for Alter Egos ""A superb journalist has brought us a vivid, page-turning, and revelatory account of the relationship between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as of their statecraft. Alter Egoswill make a signal contribution to the national debate over who should be the next American president.""--Michael Beschloss, bestselling author of Presidential Courage ""Mark Landler, one of the best reporters working in Washington today, delivers an inside account of Hillary Clinton's relationship with Barack Obama that brims with insight and high-level intrigue. It's both fun to read and eye-opening.""--Jane Mayer, bestselling author of Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right""--  ""New York Times White House correspondent Mark Landler goes behind the speeches and press conferences, to the Situation Room debates and picnic-table lunches, where Obama and Clinton honed their two competing worldviews: his, cautious, inward-looking, suffused with a sense of limits; hers, muscular, optimistic, unabashedly old-fashioned. Alter Egos is about two ambitious political archrivals from very different backgrounds who became partners for a time, trailblazers who share a common sense of their historical destiny but who hold fundamentally different beliefs about how to project American power. With all the sweep of a grand history--and enlivened by an insider's access and plenty of news--Landler digs deep into the complex relationship between these two leaders and gives us a different way to think about Obama's legacy and Clinton's promise""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Created in 1982 to counterbalance what its founders considered a liberal legal establishment, the organization has now become the conservative legal establishment, and membership is all but required for any conservative lawyer who hopes to enter politics or the judiciary. It can claim 40,000 members, including four Supreme Court Justices, dozens of federal judges, and every Republican attorney general since its inception. But its power goes even deeper. In Ideas with Consequences, Amanda Hollis-Brusky, an expert on conservative legal movements, provides the first ever comprehensive documentation of how the Federalist Society exerts its influence. Drawing from a huge trove of documents, transcripts, and interviews, she presents a series of important legal questions and explains how the Federalist Society managed to revolutionize the jurisprudence for each one. Many of these questions -- including the powers of the federal government, the individual right to bear arms, and the parameters of corporate political speech -- had long been considered settled. But the Federalist Society was able to upend the existing conventional wisdom, promoting constitutional theories that had previously been dismissed as ludicrously radical. Hollis-Brusky argues that the Federalist Society offers several of the crucial ingredients needed to accomplish this constitutional revolution. It serves as a credentialing institution for conservative lawyers and judges, legitimizes novel interpretations of the constitution through a conservative framework, and provides a judicial audience of like-minded peers, which prevents the well-documented phenomenon of conservative judges turning moderate after years on the bench. Through these functions, it is able to exercise enormous influence on important cases at every level. With unparalleled research and analysis of some of the hottest political and judicial issues of our time, Ideas with Consequences is the essential guide to the Federalist Society at a time when its power has broader implications than ever. - Publisher.

It is the first scholarly work to draw on historical anarchism to construct an international theory premised on the idea of states as anarchists. It puts forward a constructivist account of state behavior, termed 'polite anarchy', to theorize diplomacy, an area of IR which is increasingly recognized within the discipline as being under-theorized, by drawing on a contextual historical study of the idiom of politeness in the anarchist thought of the late-Enlightenment British radical, William Godwin, generally considered to be the founder of modern philosophical anarchism.

Finding magic,Sally Quinn,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL19719494W,/authors/OL394806A/Sally_Quinn,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27408166M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  HarperOne|Language English|Pages 416,"""The author, journalist, television commentator, and longtime Washington insider reflects on the spiritual quest that has brought deeper meaning to her life--and kept her grounded within the high-powered political world of Washington, D.C.'s elite--her renowned writing career, her celebrity marriage, and her legendary role as doyenne of the capital's social scene. In this emotionally involving, illuminating memoir, the legendary Washington Post journalist, author, and 'superstar hostess' (Vanity Fair) talks candidly about her life at the white-hot center of power and the surprising spiritual quest that has driven her for more than half a century. While working as a reporter, caring for a learning-disabled son with her husband, longtime Washington Post executive editor Benjamin Bradlee, reigning over the capital's social scene, and remaining intimately connected with national politics, Sally Quinn yearned to understand what truly made the world--and her life--tick. After years of searching, most of which occurring in the secular capital of the world, she came to realize that the time she spent with friends and family--the evenings of shared hospitality and intimate fellowship--provided spiritual nourishment and that this theme has been woven into all the most important moments of her life. In this spiritual memoir, Quinn speaks frankly about her varied, provocative spiritual experiences--from her Southern family of Presbyterians and psychics, to voodoo lessons from her Baptist nanny, her trials as a hospitalized military kid in Japan as the Korean War begins, to her adventures as a Post reporter and columnist and her experience as one of the first female news anchors on national television; her battles with the Nixon administration, Watergate, and other scandals that have rocked the nation; her courtship and long marriage to one of the most authoritative figures in the media; her role as the capital's most influential hostess; and her growing fascination with religious issues. This fascination led to her pioneering work in creating the most visited religious site on the web, OnFaith.co, where she reports on the unseen driving force of American life. Throughout this radiant, thoughtful, and surprisingly intimate memoir, Quinn reveals how 'it's all magic'--the many forms of what draws us together and provides meaning to all we do. Her roller coaster and irreverent but surprisingly spiritual story allows us to see how the infinite wonder of God and the values of meaningful conversation, experience, and community are available to us all. Finding Magic includes 16 pages of exclusive photographs""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Halperin and Harris tell how two families--the Bushes and the Clintons--have held the White House for a generation, and examine Hillary Clinton's prospects for extending this record in 2008. Bush's strategic genius is Karl C. Rove--arguably the most influential White House aide in history. Halperin and Harris reveal in behind-the-scenes detail what he actually does--his trade secrets for winning elections. In the case of the Clintons, the chief strategist is Bill himself. Drawing on their fifteen years reporting on and interviewing him, Halperin and Harris deconstruct and decipher the Clinton style--identifying techniques that all candidates can use in their pursuit of the White House.--From publisher description.
