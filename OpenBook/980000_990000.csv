The aim of the handbook is to treat (demonstrate) the basic methods for solving the simplest problems of classical mathematical physics. The most basic among the methods considered hrre i8 the superposition method. It allows one, based on particular linearly indepmdent HolutionH (solution ""atoms""), to obtain the solution of a given problem. To that end the ""Hupply"" of solution atoms must be complete. This method is a development of the well-known method of particular solutions from the theory of ordinar~' differelltial equations. In contrast to the case of ordinary differential equations, where the number of linearly independent 80lutions is always finite, for a linear partial differrntial equation a complete ""supply"" of solution atoms is always infinite. This infinite set of Holutions may be discrete (for example, for regular boundary vahlP problems in a bounded domain), or form a continuum (for example, in the case of problems in the whole space). In the first case the superposition method reduces to tlH' construction of a series in the indicated solution atoms with unknown coefficipnts, while in the second case the series is replaced by an integral with respect to the corm:iponding parameters (variables). This first step leads us to the general solution of the associated hOlllogeneous equation under the assumption that the set of solution atoms i;; ""complete.

But when her company goes into a tailspin, Victory falls into the arms of the ruthless cosmetics baron, Lyne Bennett. As she struggles to keep her company afloat, she learns crucial lessons about what she really wants from a relationship.One of the most powerful women in publishing, Nico O'Neilly seems to have it all -- a stellar career, a well-respected husband, and an eight-year-old daughter whom she adores. But at forty-three, Nico finds that this isn't enough. Her secret ambition is to become the first female CEO of Splatch-Verner (the multimedia company that owns her magazine), but if she's going to achieve her goal, she needs to start acting now.Wendy Healy, President of Parador Pictures, has chutzpah to spare. It’s propelled her to the very top of the cutthroat movie business, yet as she tries to bring her most important movie to the screen, her drive is not enough to save her. Selden Rose, the president of MovieTime, is secretly lobbying to oust Wendy and take over Parador; meanwhile, her twelve-year-marriage to her metrosexual househusband is falling apart. One has to go--and in a series of unconventional plot twists, Wendy finds a startling answer.Following these determined but likeable leading ladies through the ups and downs of their careers, their marriages and their affairs, Candace Bushnell shows us how three strong women stay at the top of their fields in the toughest town in the world.

But they never married. Leigh grew up without knowing her real mother-viewing the distant, romantic figure with bitterness and resentment. Her father's death, however, brought them together, as Leigh honored his deathbed request to travel to Bergen, Norway, and search out Laura Worth, the woman who had known his deepest love.   Laura, too, was haunted by the past-by the unsolved murder that had occurred on the set of her last movie, The Whisperer, where she had found the director bludgeoned to death one night. Although cleared of all guilt, she had mysteriously left the film colony forever.   When Leigh arrived in Bergen, she found Laura's life still darkened by the shadow of the crime. As a series of ""accidents"" made clear, someone was trying to destroy Laura-or drive her to self-destruction. At night in the Kalfaret house, voices would whisper ""Listen... Listen,"" just as they had in her ill-fated final film. Because she is Laura's daughter, Leigh soon finds herself a target as well, and only a climactic, terror-filled confrontation brings the long-sought answers.

EVE BENEDICT. The last of the movie goddesses, a smoky-voiced sex symbol with two Oscars, four ex-husbands, and a legion of lovers to her name. The glamorous screen star is still beautiful, still tough--and still has a heart as big as the legend that surrounds her. But Eve is a woman of mystery, whose passionate affairs and tempestuous marriages have fueled gossip columns for decades. Now she is ready to reveal her secrets to one woman... but will opening herself to Julia Summers's scrutiny endanger the only person who will tell her truth... her way?  JULIA SUMMERS. A renowned writer, as astonishingly lovely as she is private, Julia cares deeply for her young son--and not at all for a place in the spotlight. Transported from her quiet life in Connecticut to glitzy Beverly Hills, Julia hates the limelight but loves her work. But no subject is as irresistible as the glorious Eve... and no story more challenging to tell than the one nobody in Hollywood wants told. She cannot refuse the dream job Eve offers her... but can she be seduced into keeping the secrets she learns?  PAUL WINTHROP. Eve's stepson and the hottest novelist in a very hot town, Paul provokes a different kind of fantasy with his bronzed muscles and panther's grace. He has a stake in keeping Eve's image just as history has written it... but will he sacrifice the woman he's always loved for a chance to write his own happy ending?

Whitney spins a chilling tale of Lauren Castle's search for the truth behind her husband's accidental death and her famous grandmother's suicide. Two generations divide these tragic events, yet both seem curiously and inextricably linked.  In 1938, two of Hollywood's most glittering young stars, Victoria Frazer and Roger Brandt, were cast in a movie set in these mountains. Drawn to each other with a passion that was destined to cool, their ill-fated affair ended with the birth of an illegitimate daughter, Victoria's death, and the end of Roger's career. Ostracized by the movie industry, judged morally corrupt by his fans, Roger Brandt stayed on in North Carolina, but still the scandal became the stuff of Hollywood legend.  Many years later, Lauren Castle is drawn into Brandt's orbit by a more recent tragedy: the death of her filmmaker husband. Only Lauren knows that she is the daughter of Roger and Victoria's love child. As she begins to make sense of what happened to her husband and what happened in her family's past, she risks exposing herself to an evil that reaches with undiminished virulence across two generations.

At the first snowfall of the year, all the grown-ups do their usual things when a snowstorm comes, while the children are filled with wonder.''  goodreads review: When the first flakes fell from the grey sky, the postman and the farmer and the policeman and his wife scurried about doing all the practical things grownups do when a snowstorm comes. But the children laughed and danced, and caught the lacy snowflakes on their tongues. All the wonder and delight a child feels in a snowfall is caught in the pages of this book -- the frost ferns on the window sill, the snow man in the yard and the mystery and magic of a new white world. Roger Duvoisin's pictures in soft blue half-tones with briliant splashes of yellow and red emphasize the gaiety and humor as well as the poetic quality of the text.

He became a symbol of a new, rebellious generation that was sick of conventions and committed to genuine emotion and unvarnished truth. From his breakout role as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire to his mesmerizing portrayal of Don Corleone in The Godfather, he created some of the most memorable characters in American cinematic history. Brando was a paradox—intensely private but using his fame to promote worthy causes, a womanizer who clung to his childhood friends and animals. He was one of the most fiercely independent stars ever. In this book, acclaimed biographer Patricia Bosworth peels away Brando’s many layers, revealing the struggles, triumphs, and relentless ambition that transformed the irrepressible farm boy from Nebraska into a legend of American cinema.

She may have been writing the book about her late husband, aeronautical daredevil Demon Rumm, but she didn’t see the need to play host to the arrogant bad-boy actor starring in the film version’s title role. Still, for the good of the project, Kirsten agreed to share her beachfront home with the impossibly sexy screen idol.  Any other woman would do anything to be in her sandals, but Kirsten wasn’t falling for Rylan North, even if he did play his role of male lead to perfection. His down-home charm, his gentleness and virile charisma, might be seducing her in every sense of the word, but he was an actor, after all. Seducing an audience was his job. Rylan could have any woman he wanted. So why was he so desperately pretending to want her?  From the moment he saw her, Rylan North knew that Kirsten Rumm was the woman he’d been waiting all his life to cast as the star in his real-life love story. What did it matter if he was every woman’s fantasy if he couldn’t get Kirsten to so much as glance his way? He’d caught the look of past hurt behind her sky-blue eyes–a dark secret that shadowed the sparkle. Rylan was determined to find out what tragedy held this passionate woman back from a second chance at love even if it cost him his reputation, his career, and his life. But first he’d have to get Kirsten to act on her instincts . . . and to trust the flesh-and-blood man behind the fantasy.   Read more Read less",14 Want to read|0 Currently reading|7 Have read

In 2017, a routine network television investigation led to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood’s most power­ful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move, and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability, and silence victims of abuse. And it’s the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.    source: https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/ronan-farrow/catch-and-kill/9780316486668/   Read more Read less",50 Want to read|1 Currently reading|14 Have read

From Gidget's sweet-faced ""girl next door"" to the dazzling complexity of Sybil to the Academy Award-worthy ferocity and depth of Norma Rae and Mary Todd Lincoln, Field has stunned audiences time and time again with her artistic range and emotional acuity. Yet there is one character who always remained hidden: the shy and anxious little girl within. With raw honesty and the fresh, pitch-perfect prose of a natural-born writer, and with all the humility and authenticity her fans have come to expect, Field brings readers behind-the-scenes for not only the highs and lows of her star-studded early career in Hollywood, but deep into the truth of her lifelong relationships--including her complicated love for her own mother. Powerful and unforgettable, In Pieces is an inspiring and important account of life as a woman in the second half of the twentieth century.

When, at last, Belle is able to find her way back to the palace, she finds her beloved Beast lying as still as death on the ground.

As Kirk Douglas grew older, he became less impetuous and more reflective. In this poignant and inspiring new memoir, Douglas contemplates what life is all about, weighing current events from his frame of mind at ninety while summoning the passions of his younger days.    Kirk Douglas was a born storyteller, and throughout Let's Face It he tells wonderful tales and shares favorite jokes and hard-won insights. In the book, he explores the mixed blessings of growing older and looks back at his childhood, his young adulthood, and his storied, glamorous, and colorful life and career in Hollywood. He tells delightful stories of the making of such films as Spartacus, Lust for Life, Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful, and many others. He includes anecdotes about his friends Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Lauren Bacall, Ronald Reagan, Ava Gardner, Henry Kissinger, Fred Astaire, Yul Brynner, John Wayne, and Johnny Cash. He reveals the secrets that kept him and his wife, Anne, happily married for more than five decades, and talks fondly and movingly of times spent with his sons, Michael, Peter, Eric, and Joel, and his grandchildren.  Douglas's life was filled with pain as well as joy. In Let's Face It, he writes frankly for the first time about the tragic death of his son Eric from a drug overdose at age forty-five. Douglas tells what it was like to recover from several near-death episodes, including a helicopter crash, a stroke, and a cardiac event. He writes of his sadness that many of his closest friends are no longer with us; the book includes many moving stories such as one about a regular poker game at Frank Sinatra's house at which he and Anne were fixtures along with Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, and their wives. Though many of the players are gone, the game continues to this day.  In Let's Face It, Douglas reflects on how his Jewish faith became more and more important to him over the years. He offers strong opinions on everything from anti-Semitism to corporate greed, from racism to Hurricane Katrina, and from the war in Iraq to the situation in Israel. He writes about the importance in his life of the need to improve education for all children and about how we need to care more about the world and less about ourselves.

D. Eastman. It was written in 1958.  Sam, an owl, awakens one night and looks for a playmate. However, since it is the middle of the night, all the creatures are asleep. Sam then comes across a series of flying lights, one of which hits Sam in the head. It is Gus, a firefly. Gus shows Sam the trick he can do, which is he can make glowing lines in midair using his light. Sam is amazed and decides to have fun by having Gus follow him directly as he flies. Sam flies in the shape of various words; Gus finds this fun and decides to do more on his own. However, he has mischief on his mind.  First, he causes several cars to crash at an intersection by displaying ""Go left"", ""go right"", ""stop"", and ""go"" above. Sam wants to talk to him about this behavior, that it is dangerous and bad; however, Gus abandons Sam as he thinks Sam doesn't know how to have fun. Gus then continues to cause mischief; he causes several airplanes to get crossed up by displaying random directions, he causes people to overflow into a movie theater by displaying ""COME IN! FREE SHOW"" above it, and he changes a sign from ""Hot Dogs"" to ""COLD HOT DOGS"", deterring the hot dog maker's customers. The hot dog maker immediately nets Gus and puts him a jar and into his pickup truck. Sam sees this and is determined to save him.  Gus regrets not listening to Sam's warnings about having too much fun. The aforementioned pickup truck stalls on a railroad crossing with a train coming. Sam arrives at the scene and breaks the jar containing Gus, freeing him. Now free, Gus displays ""STOP"" several times in large letters. The locomotive's engineer sees Gus' messages and the truck on the tracks. The engineer applies the brake and stops the train just in time. The hot dog maker and the engineer and brakeman all call Gus a hero, and Gus and Sam fly off into the night. As dawn arrives, they must go back to their homes to sleep, since they are nocturnal. However, Gus continues to visit Sam's tree home every night to play.   Read more Read less",28 Want to read|1 Currently reading|4 Have read

Hot target: a novel,Suzanne Brockmann,picture_books,First published in 2004,/works/OL84180W?edition=ia%3Ahottargetnovel00broc_0,/authors/OL40094A/Suzanne_Brockmann,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9453779M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 28, 2004|Publisher  Ballantine Books|Language English|Pages 416","New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann knows exactly what makes hearts race and pulses pound: peril and passion. No one succeeds more brilliantly at blending these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple with the deepest emotions and the highest risks. And there's no better proof than her new novel of suspense: Hot Target aims to thrill on every level. Like most men of action, Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter never learned how to take a vacation. So when he finds himself facing a month's leave, he offers his services to Troubleshooters Incorporated. Founded by a former SEAL, the private-sector security firm is a major player in the ongoing war against terrorism, known for carrying out covert missions too volatile for official U.S. military action. But the first case Richter takes on is anything but under the radar.High-profile maverick movie producer Jane Mercedes Chadwick hasn't quite completed her newest film, but she's already courting controversy. The World War II epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a real-life hero--and the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups. But despite a relentless campaign of angry E-mails, phone calls, and smear tactics, Chadwick won't be pressured into abandoning the project. Then the harassment turns to death threats.While the FBI appears on the scene, nervous Hollywood associates call in Troubleshooters, and now Chadwick has an army of round-the-clock bodyguards, whether she likes it or not. And she definitely doesn't. But her stubbornness doesn't make FBI agent Jules Cassidy's job any easier. The fiercely independent filmmaker presents yet another emotional obstacle that Cassidy doesn't need--he's already in the midst of a personal tug-of-war with his ex-lover, while fighting a growing attraction to Chadwick's brother.Determined to succeed--and survive--on her own terms, Chadwick will face off with enemies and allies alike. But she doesn't count on the bond she forms with the quiet, capable Cosmo Richter. Yet even as their feelings bring them closer, the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter. And when all hell erupts, desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap them both in the crossfire.From the Hardcover edition.

Hyman,picture_books,First published in 1985,/works/OL5107252W?edition=ia%3Amymotherskeeper0000hyma,/authors/OL1124988A/B._D._Hyman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3020120M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1985|Publisher  Morrow|Language English|Pages 348,"An exposé of sorts, My Mother's Keeper is often compared to the 1978 book Mommie Dearest by Christina Crawford, the daughter of Joan Crawford. Published after Crawford's book, Hyman also paints a very unflattering portrait of her mother, depicting her as a self-centered, emotionally abusive alcoholic. Unlike Crawford, Hyman does not accuse her mother of any physical abuse. Indeed, she claims Davis was a battered woman and states that Davis' actor husband Gary Merrill was a violent alcoholic. Unlike Crawford's book, which was published after the death of its subject, Hyman's book and a sequel titled Narrow Is the Way were published during Davis' lifetime, thereby affording the actress an opportunity to respond to their allegations. Davis tried unsuccessfully to block publication of the books.   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

All books of the series rank around a fox family; a mother with three fox kids. 'Naschfuchs' deals with the problem of children's overweight and the consume of too much unhealthy food. So, two of the fox kids are normal weight, active and sporty. The third child is overweight, bulky and immobile. The fox mother constantly worries about her third child, because it refuses to play like its siblings, it also doesn't eat anything at family's meals (afterwards, in secret, it empties the store cupboard). The mother fears a serious illness of her child.  The turning point comes when the mother admires her two healthy kids playing in the forest. The third one also tries to play in the same way, but fails. After that it denies unhealthy food. The story comes to its happy end, with the mother finally having three slender, sporty kids.

Come heck or high water, Gracie Snow is determined to drag the legendary ex-jock Bobby Tom Denton back home to Heaven, Texas, to begin shooting his first motion picture. Despite his dazzling good looks and killer charm, Bobby Tom has reservations about being a movie star — and no plans to cooperate with a prim and bossy Ohio wallflower whom he can’t get off his mind or out of his life.

And all hell breaks loose when two unforgettable people discover love, laughter, passion — and a match that can only be made in Heaven.

Technology and information crosses countries and continents at blistering speed. Corporations thrive on being multinational and polyglot. Yet the world's estimated 244 million total migrant population, particularly those deemed 'illegal' by countries and societies, are locked in a chaotic and circular debate about borders and documents, assimilation and identity. An issue about movement seems immovable: politically, culturally and personally. Dear America: Notes Of An Undocumented Citizen is an urgent, provocative and deeply personal account from Jose Antonio Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who happens to be the most well-known undocumented immigrant in the United States. Born in the Philippines and brought to the U.S. illegally as a 12-year-old, Vargas hid in plain-sight for years, writing for some of the most prestigious news organizations in the country (The Washington Post, The New Yorker) while lying about where he came from and how he got here. After publicly admitting his undocumented status--risking his career and personal safety--Vargas has challenged the definition of what it means to be an American, and has advocated for the human rights of immigrants and migrants during the largest global movement of people in modern history. Both a letter to America and a window into Vargas's America, this book is a transformative argument about migration and citizenship, and an intimate, searing exploration on what it means to be home when the country you call your home doesn't consider you one of its own""--   Read more Read less",15 Want to read|2 Currently reading|0 Have read

Seuss scholar/collector Charles D. Cohen has hunted down seven rarely seen stories by Dr. Seuss. Originally published in magazines between 1950 and 1951, they include ""The Bear, the Rabbit, and the Zinniga-Zanniga "" (about a rabbit who is saved from a bear with a single eyelash!); ""Gustav the Goldfish"" (an early, rhymed version of the Beginner Book A Fish Out of Water);  ""Tadd and Todd"" (a tale passed down via photocopy to generations of twins); ""Steak for Supper"" (about fantastic creatures who follow a boy home in anticipation of a steak dinner); ""The Bippolo Seed"" (in which a scheming feline leads an innocent duck to make a bad decision); ""The Strange Shirt Spot"" (the inspiration for the bathtub-ring scene in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back); and ""The Great Henry McBride"" (about a boy whose far-flung career fantasies are only bested by those of the real Dr. Seuss himself). In an introduction to the collection, Cohen explains the significance these seven stories have, not only as lost treasures, but as transitional stories in Dr. Seuss's career.  With a color palette that has been enhanced beyond the limitations of the original magazines in which they appeared, this is a collection of stories that no Seuss fan (whether scholar or second-grader) will want to miss! - Publisher.

It wasn't until 1988 that Marli Renfro made news again-raped and murdered by a serial killer with a fetish for the classic Hitchcock shocker.

And if Marli was still alive, would he ever find her?The line between art and reality is blurred in this astonishing coda to one of the most memorable screen murders of all time, and to a real- life crime that one man was determined to solve.

Bei der Vorstellung, mit diesem doch sicherlich gestohlenen Ding ertappt zu werden und ins Gefängnis zu kommen, gerät er in Panik. Das Ding muss verschwinden und er schafft das nach langem Bemühen auch! Aber am nächsten Morgen erwacht Herr Igel, weil er im Mond feststeckt ... Wie diese zwei und ein Bock und eine grössere Anzahl von Mäusen das Problem mit dem Mond lösen, ist sehenswert. Diese surreale Geschichte wird mit hochkomischen hyperrealen Bildern erzählt. Es ist ein Bilderbuch im besten Sinne des Wortes, weil die Bilder mehr erzählen als der Text und einen Prolog sowie einen Epilog enthalten. Man muss so das Buch von ganz vorne bis hinten betrachten. Einfach göttlich! Ab 6 Jahren, ausgezeichnet, Monika Hedinger.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

This island nation, with a population of 20 million, has produced some of the biggest names in Hollywood and the trend shows no signs of letting up.In Aussiewood, top Australian show-biz journalists Michaela Boland and Michael Bodey take us behind the scenes to meet the stars. Nicole, Heath, Hugh and many others tell us about their backgrounds, their dreams and their fears. They describe the glamour and the business of Hollywood, how they've dealt with sudden fame and how they shot - or climbed - to the top. Some did it tough, some relatively easy; some pursued stardom with voracious ambition, for others Hollywood came knocking ...But what led to Hollywood's fascination with Australia? Is it about talent? Does it come down to economics? Or is Australia simply flavour of the month? Aussiewood goes beyond the personal stories to explore why so many have shot to stardom so quickly. It uncovers a wealth and diversity of talent, on both sides of the camera.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At sixteen, they want to run away, especially from their father who insists, “You’re a boy, so you have to act like one.” Who will Ari become?  Moving from age six to adolescence, The Name I Call Myself touchingly depicts Edward’s tender, solitary gender journey to Ari: a new life distinguished and made meaningful by self-acceptance and unconditional love. Ages 5 to 12.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Since the day he hatched, Owl dreamed of becoming a real knight. He may not be the biggest or the strongest, but his sharp nocturnal instincts can help protect the castle, especially since many knights have recently gone missing. While holding guard during Knight Night Watch, Owl is faced with the ultimate trial—a frightening intruder. It’s a daunting duel by any measure. But what Owl lacks in size, he makes up for in good ideas.  Full of wordplay and optimism, this surprising display of bravery proves that cleverness (and friendship) can rule over brawn.

Over the course of her extraordinary life and career, Audrey Hepburn captured hearts around the world and created a public image that stands as one of the most recognizable and beloved in recent memory. But despite her international fame and her tireless efforts on behalf of UNICEF, Audrey was also known for her intense privacy. With unprecedented access to studio archives, friends and colleagues who knew and loved Audrey, bestselling author Donald Spoto provides an intimate and moving account of this beautiful, elusive and talented woman.Tracing her astonishing rise to stardom, from her harrowing childhood in Nazi-controlled Holland during World War II to her years as a struggling ballet dancer in London and her Tony Award--winning Broadway debut in Gigi, Spoto illuminates the origins of Audrey's tenacious spirit and fiercely passionate nature.She would go on to star in some of the most popular movies of the twentieth century, including Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Funny Face, The Nun's Story, Breakfast at Tiffany's and My Fair Lady. A friend and inspiration to renowned designer Hubert de Givenchy, Audrey emerged as a fashion icon as well as a film legend, her influence on women's fashion virtually unparalleled to this day.But behind the glamorous public persona, Audrey Hepburn was both a different and a deeper person and a woman who craved love and affection. Donald Spoto offers remarkable insights into her professional and personal relationships with her two husbands, and with celebrities such as Gregory Peck, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, Robert Anderson, Cary Grant, Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and Ben Gazzara. The turbulent romances of her youth, her profound sympathy for the plight of hungry children, and the thrills and terrors of motherhood prepared Audrey for the final chapter in her life, as she devoted herself entirely to the charity efforts of an organization that had once come to her rescue at the end of the war: UNICEF.Donald Spoto has written a poignant, funny and deeply moving biography of an unforgettable woman. At last, Enchantment reveals the private Audrey Hepburn--and invites readers to fall in love with her all over again.""She was as funny as she was beautiful. She was a magical combination of high chic and high spirits."" --Gregory Peck""In spite of her fragile appearance, she's like steel."" --Cary Grant""Audrey was known for something which has disappeared, and that is elegance, grace and manners . . . God kissed her on the cheek, and there she was."" --Billy Wilder""There is not a woman alive who does not dream of looking like Audrey Hepburn."" --Hubert de Givenchy""Her magnetism was so extraordinary that everyone wanted to be close to her. It was as if she placed a glass barrier between herself and the world. You couldn't get behind it easily. It made her remarkably attractive."" --Stanley Donen""She has authentic charm. Most people simply have nice manners."" --Alfred LuntFrom the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Filmmakers Chase Ryan and Keith Ellison left the mission field of Indonesia for the mission field of Hollywood with a dream bigger than both of them. Now they have done the impossible: raised enough money to produce a feature film with a message that could change the world.  But as Chase and Keith begin shooting, their well-laid plans begin to unravel. With millions of dollars on the line, they make a desperate attempt to keep the film from falling apart---even as a temperamental actress, a botched production schedule, and their own insecurities leave little room for the creative and spiritual passion that once motivated them. Was God really behind this movie after all? A chance meeting and friendship with John Baxter could bring the encouragement they need to stay on mission and produce a movie that will actually change people's lives.  In the midst of the questions and the cameras, is it possible to keep things above the line and make a movie unlike anything done before---or is the risk too great for everyone?

Her sister's alcoholic husband claims that she has run off and dumped their six children at the county orphanage, and he doesn't care. Desperate to keep the family together, Susanna seeks help from her uncle Will in Westerville. Johann Giere is heir to a thriving German-American brewery in Columbus. When he helps a saloon owner take beer to Westerville, Johann expects a fight between the new saloon and the driest town in America. He doesn't expect to meet Susanna, a pretty temperance crusader who wins his sympathy. The small town erupts in gunpowder and fire, but Johann vows to help Susanna rescue her nieces and nephews. Susanna grows to admire him even as she detests his business. He finds her lovelier with every passing day, until they both face an impossible choice between passion and principle. Lovelier than Daylight is a novel of faith and grace inspired by the real Hanby family of Ohio and their role in the Westerville Whiskey Wars""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this memoir, Julie Andrews takes us from her early years with an aspiring Vaudeville mom and a loving dad, to her parents’ divorce and mother’s remarriage to a difficult stepfather. Julie has kept diaries her whole life, so every anecdote in her memoir is very fresh and immediate. There are incredible scenes of the London Blitz during WWII; at age nine, she was the only kid on the street who was able to identify the sound of the German bombers, and it was her job to warn the whole neighborhood when they were coming. She performed for the Queen at age 12, and by the time she was a young teen, she was supporting her entire family because her stepdad was an alcoholic. A few of her roles were more glamorous during this time, but she was always the performer with holes in her socks because she never had any money. At age 19, Julie tried out for the role in The Boy Friend, which was opening on Broadway in New York. She got the part, was a smash in the play, and then starred in My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison. The book carries through her role in Camelot with Richard Burton, after which her daughter was born. There are great anecdotes about the actors and actresses of her day and her voice is humorous, warm, and lively, adding up to an incredible memoir.

Beginning with the classic Live and Let Die, running through Moonraker and A View to a Kill, Moore brought his finely honed wit and wry charm to one of Hollywood's most beloved and long-lasting characters. Still, James Bond was only one in a lifetime of roles stretching back to Hollywood's studio era, and encompassing stardom in theater and television on both sides of the Atlantic. From The Saint to Maverick, Warner Brothers to MGM, Hollywood to London to extreme locations the world over, Roger Moore's story is one of the last of the classic Hollywood lives as yet untold.Until now. From the dying days of the studio system and the birth of television, to the quips of Noel Coward and David Niven, to the bedroom scenes and outtakes from the Bond movies, Moore has seen and heard it all. Nothing is left out — especially the naughty bits. The 'special effects' by which James Bond unzipped a dress with a magnet; the spectacular risks in The Spy Who Loved Me's opening scene; and Moore's preparation for facing down villains (he would imagine they all have halitosis): the stories in My Word is My Bond are priceless.Throughout his career, Moore hobnobbed with the glamorous and powerful, counting Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Seymour, and Cary Grant among his contemporaries and friends. Included are stories of a foul-mouthed Milton Berle, a surly Richard Burton, and a kindhearted Richard Kiel, infamous as Bond enemy Jaws.As much as it is Moore's own exceptional story, My Word is My Bond is a treasure trove of Hollywood history.

Now How Beautiful It Is And How Easily It Can Be Broken reveals all at once the enormous stature of Mendelsohn's achievement and demonstrates why he is considered one of our greatest critics. Writing with a lively intelligence and arresting originality, he brings his distinctive combination of scholarly rigor and conversational ease to bear across eras, cultures, and genres, from Roman games to video games. His interpretations of our most talked-about films—from the work of Pedro Almodovar to Brokeback Mountain, from United 93 and World Trade Center to 300, Marie Antoinette, and The Hours—have sparked debate and changed the way we watch movies. Just as stunning and influential are his dispatches on theater and literature, from The Producers to Jeffrey Eugenides' Middlesex, from The Lovely Bones to the works of Harold Pinter. Together these thirty brilliant and engaging essays passionately articulate the themes that have made Daniel Mendelsohn a crucial voice in today's cultural conversation: the aesthetic and indeed political dangers of imposing contemporary attitudes on the great classics; the ruinous effect of sentimentality on the national consciousness in the post-9/11 world; the vital importance of the great literature of the past for a meaningful life in the present. How Beautiful It Is And How Easily It Can Be Broken makes it clear that no other contemporary thinker is as engaged with as many aspects of our culture and its influences as Mendelsohn is, and no one practices the vanishing art of popular criticism with more acuity, humor, and feeling.

Ehon: The Artist and the Book in Japan,Roger S. Keyes,picture_books,First published in 2006,/works/OL14853520W,/authors/OL20749A/Roger_S._Keyes,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9666878M-M.jpg,"Publish Date October 30, 2006|Publisher  New York Public Library|Language English|Pages 320","Ehon - or ""picture books""- are part of an incomparable 1,200-year-old Japanese tradition. Created by artists and craftsmen, most ehon also feature essays, poems, or other texts written in beautiful, distinctive calligraphy. They are by nature collaborations: visual artists, calligraphers, writers, and designers join forces with papermakers, binders, block cutters, and printers. The books they create are strikingly beautiful, highly charged microcosms of deep feeling, sharp intensity, and extraordinary intelligence. In the elegant, richly illustrated Ehon: The Artist and the Book in Japan, renowned scholar Roger S. Keyes traces the history and evolution of these remarkable books through seventy key works, including many great rarities and unique masterpieces, from the Spencer Collection of the New York Public Library, one of the foremost collections of Japanese illustrated books in the West.  The earliest ehon were made as religious offerings or talismans, but their great flowering began in the early modern period (1600-1868) and has continued, with new media and new styles and subjects, to the present. Shiohi no tsuto (Gifts of the Ebb Tide, 1789; often called The Shell Book) by Kitagawa Utamaro, one of the supreme achievements of the ehon tradition, is reproduced in full. Michimori (ca. 1604), a luxuriously produced libretto for a No play is also featured, as are Saito- Shu-ho's cheerful Kishi empu (Mr. Ginger's Book of Love, 1803), Kamisaka Sekka's brilliant Momoyogusa (Flowers of a Hundred Worlds, 1910), and many more.  Ehon: The Artist and the Book in Japan ends with ehon by some of the most innovative practitioners of the twentieth century. Among these are Chizu (The Map, 1965), Kawada Kikuji's profound photographic requiem for Hiroshima; Yoko Tawada's and Stephan Kohler's affecting Ein Gedicht f�r ein Buch (A Poem for a Book, 1996); and Vija Celmins's and Eliot Weinberger's Hoshi (The Stars, 2005).  The magnificent ehon tradition originated in Japan and developed there under very specific conditions, but it has long since burst its bounds, like any living tradition. Ehon: The Artist and the Book in Japan suggests that when artists meet readers in these contrived, protected, focused, sacred book ""worlds,"" the possibilities for pleasure, insight, and inspiration are limitless.  Roger S. Keyes, a visiting scholar in East Asian Studies at Brown University, has written many books and articles about Japanese prints, most recently a catalogue raisonee of the prints of Katsushika Hokusai.

Years ago Anne and Howard met studying litera-ture at Columbia—she, the daughter of a British diplo-mat from London, he a boy from an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn. Now on sleek blue California evenings, Anne attends halogen-lit movie premieres on the arm of her powerful husband. But her private life is lived in the world of her garden, reading books.When one of Howard's friends, the head of a studio, asks Anne to make a reading list, she casually agrees—though, as a director reminds her, ""no one reads in Hollywood."" To her surprise, they begin calling: screen-writers; producers, from their bungalows; and agents, from their plush offices on Wilshire and Beverly. Soon Anne finds herself leading an exclusive book club for the industry elite. Emerging gradually from her seclu-sion, she guides her readers into the ideas and beauties of Donne, Yeats, Auden, and Mamet, with her brilliant and increasingly bold opinions. But when a crisis of identity unexpectedly turns an anguished Howard back toward the Orthodoxy he left behind as a young man, Anne must set out to save what she values above all else: her husband's love.At once fiercely intelligent and emotionally grip-ping, You or Someone Like You confronts the fault lines between inherited faith and personal creed, and, through the surprising transformation of one exceptional, unfor-gettable woman, illuminates literature's power to change our lives.

He ultimately came to live with a foster family, where he endured near-constant verbal and physical abuse. In his mid-teens he escaped and enlisted in the navy, where he became a man of the world, raised by the family he created for himself. Finding Fish shows how, out of this unlikely mix of deprivation and hope, an artist was born -- first as the child who painted the feelings his words dared not speak, then as a poet and storyteller who would eventually become one of Hollywood's most sought-after screenwriters. A tumultuous and ultimately gratifying tale of self-discovery written in Fisher's gritty yet melodic literary voice, Finding Fish is an unforgettable reading experience.

Sport ist herrlich,Ole Könnecke,picture_books,First published in 2017,/works/OL19735826W,/authors/OL6579811A/Ole_Könnecke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language German,"Sport ist herrlich! Fußball zum Beispiel - außer, die eigene Mannschaft schießt immer knapp neben das Tor. Dann fließen manchmal sogar Tränen. Tennis ist reizvoll, weil man sich zwischen Grundlinie und Netz viel bewegen kann. Leider meistens dann, wenn der Gegner einen gerade geschickt ausspielt. Beim Golf muss man den Ball in 18 Löcher schlagen. Wenn das nicht gelingt, kann man immerhin Bekanntschaft mit Wasserlöschern und Sandbänken machen. Und auch beim Skifahren landet man nicht immer da, wo man hinwill - aber sogar auf dem Hosenboden kommt man irgendwann unten an. Ole Könnecke stellt die schönsten Sportarten vor - oft lakonisch, manchmal lehrreich, aber immer mit Witz ins Bild gesetzt.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a Tyrannosaurus egg, Ron rolled into a Triceratops nest. He grew up calling Little T his brother and became king of the Triceratops with the promise: ""Trixies first!"" When things go sour in this dinosaur fable, Little T has to decide where his loyalty lies. Atmospheric illustrations and building tension capped off by action make King Ron of the Triceratops accessible to children considerably younger than its nominal grade level. A first-grader reading above his grade level can tackle the book (pegged at grade four) on his own. King Ron of the Triceratops includes a little explanatory ditty for those who like their parables and fables explained. The song notation includes chords for an accompanist.

Born in Brooklyn in 1893, she was the child of a former bare-knuckles boxer and an immigrant whose aspirations made her a classic stage mother. Baby Mae was performing by age five; by the time she was twenty, she was a seasoned trouper on the Keith vaudeville circuit and had begun to write her own material. When prudery squelched her as a vaudeville headline, she moved to the more cosmopolitan legitimate stage. Here, too, censors tried to shut her down, but the headlines sparked by obscenity trials for her plays Sex and The Pleasure Man catapulted her instead to box office success and Hollywood. There, in 1933, she was credited with restoring a sick box office and reviving the moribund Paramount Studio. But when bluenoses struck once again, this time the formidable Hays Office, her career suffered a blow from which it would never completely recover. This first intensive biography of Mae West focuses not on the kitsch of her later years but rather on the dynamic, creative, sexually adventurous young woman who took aggressive control of her own performances and in the process made her face and form among the world's most famous. It is also a window on the history of American urban entertainment, and especially on its love-hate relationship with sex.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Irving, a renowned obstetrician and gynecologist, and includes Mr. Irving's incisive history of abortion politics in the United States. But My Movie Business focuses primarily on the thirteen years John Irving spent adapting his novel The Cider House Rules for the screen--for four different directors.        Mr. Irving also writes about the failed effort to make his first novel, Setting Free the Bears, into a movie; about two of the films that were made from his novels (but not from his screenplays), The World According to Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire; about his slow progress at shepherding his screenplay of A Son of the Circus into production.        Not least, and in addition to its qualities as a memoir--anecdotal, comic, affectionate, and candid--My Movie Business is an insightful essay on the essential differences between writing a novel and writing a screenplay.The photographs in My Movie Business were taken by Stephen Vaughan, the still photographer on the set of The Cider House Rules--a Miramax production directed by Lasse Hallstrom, with Michael Caine in the role of Dr. Larch. Concurrently with the November 1999 release of the film, Talk Miramax Books will publish John Irving's screenplay.From the Hardcover edition.

Georgie York, once the costar of America's favorite television sitcom, has been publicly abandoned by her famous husband, her film career has tanked, her father is driving her crazy, and her public image as a spunky heroine is taking a serious beating.What should a down-on-her-luck actress do? Not go to Vegas . . . not run into her detestable former costar, dreamboat-from-hell Bramwell Shepard . . . and not get caught up in an ugly incident that leads to a calamitous elopement. Before she knows it, Georgie has a fake marriage, a fake husband, and maybe (or not) a fake sex life.It's a paparazzi free-for-all, and Georgie's nonsupporting cast doesn't help. There's Bram's punk-nightmare housekeeper, Georgie's own pushy parent, a suck-up agent, an icy studio head with a private agenda, and her ex-husband's new wife, who can't get enough of doing good deeds and saving the world — the bitch. As for Georgie's leading man, Bram's giving the performance of his life, but he's never cared about anyone except himself, and it's not exactly clear why.Two enemies find themselves working without a script in a town where the spotlight shines bright . . . and where the strongest emotions can wear startling disguises.

Tami Charles pens a poetic, lyrical text that is part love letter, part anthem, assuring readers that they always have, and always will, matter. This powerful, rhythmic lullaby reassures readers that their matter and their worth is never diminished, no matter the circumstance: through the joy and wonder of their first steps and first laughs, through the hardship of adolescent struggles, and the pain and heartbreak of current events, they always have, and always will, matter. Accompanied by illustrations by renowned artist Bryan Collier, a four-time Caldecott Honor recipient and a nine-time Coretta Scott King Award winner or honoree, All Because You Matter empowers readers with pride, joy, and comfort, reminding them of their roots and strengthening them for the days to come.  Lyrical, personal, and full of love, All Because You Matter is for the picture book audience what The Hate U Give was for YA and Ghost Boys was for middle grade: a conversation starter, a community touchstone, and a deep affirmation of worth for the young readers who need it most.

Along the way, she shares wonderfully revealing anecdotes about Marlon Brando, Meryl Streep, Dianne Keaton, Sissy Spacek, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, the Kennedy family, and many more. Funny, frank, brilliant, and altogether human, this is the real Cloris Leachman as you've never seen her before.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
