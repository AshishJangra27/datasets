With a nod to Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, and other ruthless yet highly successful managers, Dan S. Kennedy delivers the answer. In this new edition, Kennedy expands on his proven (if radical) strategies to get accountability, profitability, and productivity from employees. In his traditional No B.S. style, Kennedy kicks traditional leadership and management ideas squarely in the teeth with a realistic, straightforward assessment of the real relationship between business owners and their employees. Uncompromising strategies help managers gain iron-fisted control and get the results they demand. This take-no-prisoners advice liberates entrepreneurs to act in their best interests and insist on implementation of their objectives. And it leads to a cooperative, high-performance team when traditional textbook methods fail. Topics include learning how to hire profitable employees, taking home as much money as possible, making every employee's job a profit center, managing the powerful force of word of mouth, compressing the time between idea and action for maximum profits, and posing questions to individuals that force them to think and improve productivity""--  ""Giving a nod to Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney and other ruthless, yet highly successful, managers everywhere, Kennedy presents what it really takes to get productivity from people and by doing so, maximum profits.

How have they always done it? Strategy guru Roger Martin and Skoll Foundation CEO Sally Osberg make a compelling argument that social entrepreneurs are agents of change who recognize, in our current reality, various kinds of ""equilibria""-systems in need of change-and then advance social progress by transforming these systems, ultimately replacing what exists with a new equilibrium. Seen in this light, social entrepreneurship is not a marginal activity, but one that unleashes new value for society by releasing untapped human ambition. The book begins with a probing and useful theory of social entrepreneurship, moving through history to illuminate what it is, how it works, and the nature of its role in modern society. The authors then set out a framework for understanding how successful social entrepreneurs actually go about producing transformative change. There are four key stages: understanding the world; envisioning a better future; building a model for change; and scaling the solution. With both depth and nuance, Martin and Osberg offer rich examples and stories, and share lessons and tools applicable to everyone who aspires to drive positive change, whatever the context. Getting Beyond Better offers a bold new framework demonstrating how and why meaningful change actually happens in the world, and offering concrete lessons and a practical model for businesses, policy-makers, and civil society organizations to generate new value, again and again.

In Enterprise Information Management, editor Paul Baan and a team of expert contributors present a holistic approach to EIM, with an emphasis on action-oriented decision making.   The authors demonstrate that EIM must be promoted from the top down, in order to ensure that the entire organization is committed to establishing and supporting the systems and processes designed to capture, store, analyze, and disseminate information.  They identify three key “pillars” of applications: (1) business intelligence (the information and knowledge management process itself); (2) enterprise content management (company-wide management of unstructured information, including document management, digital asset management, records management, and web content management); and (3) enterprise search (using electronic tools to retrieve information from databases, file systems, and legacy systems).  The authors explore EIM from economic and socio-psychological perspectives, considering the “ROI” (return on information) of IT and related technological investments, and the cultural and behavioral aspects through which people and machines interact.  Illustrating concepts through case examples, the authors provide a variety of tools for managers to assess and improve the effectiveness of their EIM infrastructure, considering its implications for customer and client relations, process and system improvements, product and service innovations, and financial performance.

""Now in its second edition, Big Business, Poor Peoples finds that these corporations are damaging the lives of millions of poor people in developing countries. Looking at every sector where transnational corporations are involved, this vital book is packed with detail on how the poor are affected. The book exposes how developing countries' natural resources are being ceded to TNCs and how governments are unwilling or unable to control them. The author argues that TNCs, answerable to no one but their shareholders, have used their money, size and power to influence international negotiations and taken full advantage of the move towards privatizat ion to influence government policies. But people are fighting back : citizens, workers, and communities are exposing the corporations and looking for alternat ives.""

Complexity is killing companies' ability to innovate and adapt, and simplicity is fast becoming the competitive advantage of our time. Why Simple Wins helps leaders and their teams move beyond the feelings of frustration and futility that come with so much unproductive work in today's corporate world to create a corporate culture where valuable, essential, meaningful work is the norm. By learning how to eliminate redundancies, communicate with clarity, and make simplification a habit, individuals and companies can begin to recognize which activities are time-sucks and which create lasting value. Lisa Bodell's simplification method has several unique principles:Simplification is a skill that's available to us all, yet very few leaders use it. Simplification is the right thing to do-for our customers, for our company, and for each other. Operating with simplification as our core business model will make it easier to be respectful of each other's time. Simplification drives culture, and culture in turn drives employee engagement, customer relations, and overall productivity. This book is inspired by Bodell's passion for eliminating barriers to innovation and productivity. In it, she explains why change and innovation are so hard to achieve-and it's not what you might expect. The reality is this: we spend our days drowning in mundane tasks like meetings, emails, and reports. These are often self-created complexities that prevent us from getting to the meaningful work that truly matters. Using simple stories and techniques, Why Simple Wins shows that by using simplicity as an operating principle, we can eliminate the busy work that puts a chokehold on us every day, and instead spend time on the work that we value""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This innovative text helps you sharpen your economic intuition--an invaluable skill that helps you, as a future manager, decide which products to produce, costs to consider, and prices to charge, as well as the best hiring policy and the most effective style of organization. With its unique integrative approach, the text demonstrates that important business decisions are interdisciplinary, illustrating how different functions work together. A basic valuation model is constructed and used as the underlying economic model of the firm; each topic is then related to an element of the value maximization model--a process that shows how management integrates accounting, finance, marketing, personnel, and production functions. The text also provides an intuitive guide to marginal analysis and basic economic relations.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Energy poverty is said to occur when such amenities cannot be secured up to a socially- and physically- necessitated level. Millions of people across the world suffer from energy poverty due to a combination of financial, social and technical circumstances. Energy Poverty and Vulnerability provides novel and critical perspectives on the drivers and consequences of energy-related injustices in the home. Drawing together original research conducted by leading experts, the book offers fresh and innovative insights into the ways in which hitherto unexplored factors such as cultural norms, environmental conditions and household needs combine to shape vulnerability to energy poverty. Case studies from a wide range of countries are presented, thus providing the first globally-integrated account of a policy and research domain that has previously been divided between the Global South and North. An examination of the diverse manifestations of energy poverty is supplemented by an identification of this condition?s shared and context-specific causes. Conveying policy-relevant insights that can inform decision-making, this book can be of great interest to students and scholars of energy demand, social justice, and sustainability transitions, as well as decision-makers and practitioners who wish to find out more about this complex issue.

Providing both protection against loss and potential for exceptional profits, they are ideal for virtually any trader or investor.The Options Strategist outlines effective and easy-to-follow strategies for incorporating the power of equity options into your trading program. Starting with the basics of options and options trading, it goes on to reveal specific strategies that you can use to:Maximize your trading profits in up, down, or sideways markets Protect your portfolio against sudden market declines Take advantage of price swings, regardless of their direction Hedge your corporate stock and/or options against unforeseen events Employ advanced options techniques to take your trading success to the next level It’s time that you discovered the many benefits of equity options. Let The Options Strategist show you just how easy and profitable options investing can be and provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to give your portfolio the options advantage.Investors of all types, with portfolios of every size, are beginning to realize the protection and profit in equity options. Long seen as a volatile investment designed strictly for gamblers and high rollers, options in fact offer unique advantages to even the most conservative investor and are suitable for rounding out virtually any investment portfolio.The Options Strategist tells you everything you need to know to trade and invest with equity options. Whether you use options to aggressively increase trading profits through the power of leverage or conservatively protect the stocks in your portfolio against sudden market reversals, this hands-on, practical guide will introduce you to strategies from basic to advanced, including:Buying calls and puts Writing covered calls and puts Writing naked calls and puts Straddles Spreads Strangles Collars Combinations But more than just discussing what to do and how to do it, The Options Strategist explains why to do it. Why would an investor buy an option to purchase 100 shares of a stock instead of just buying the stock itself? Why would an investor write calls on shares of stock he or she already owns? Or write both puts and calls on that same stock? This plain-talking guidebook explains the strategic motivation behind each of these examples and dozens more, along with the rewards, risks, best outcomes, and worst outcomes for each.In addition, The Options Strategist takes an in-depth look at the theory behind options investing. Option pricing, implied and historical volatility, the Greeks, the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model: For each of these topics, key questions are asked and answered, central arguments are introduced and analyzed, and specific technical terms are demystified to underscore their practical applications (or lack thereof) for options traders and investors.

Flex offers a proactive strategy for managers to navigate and leverage diversity effectively in this new global economy, showing managers how to: understand the power gap, the social distance between you and those in the workplace of different cultures, ages, and gender; flex your management style, by stretching how you work and communicate with others, and bridging the gap with more effective communication, feedback tools and building healthy teams; and multiply the effect, by teaching these skills to others and closing the power gap with clients, customers, and partners to create innovative solutions. Creating flex in a company's management style will impact all aspects of developing the talent you have, attracting future talent and building relationships with customers in this competitive marketplace. Now, Flex: The New Playbook for Managing Across Differences shows you how.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet, there is no clear-cut and effective strategy to develop industries. This study tackles the problems facing cluster-based industrial development and suggests effective strategies for a more successful future.Based on a number of case studies and the results of six KAIZEN management training experiments, this book has found that efficient management is the key to the innovation, which, in turn, is a major engine of firm and industrial growth. The studies undertaken reveal that management training not only enhances management capacity of entrepreneurs but also serves as an effective screening device to identify promising and non-promising entrepreneurs, which enables targeted policies to support the former. KAIZEN management is found to be effective in improving production management and quality control in several countries in SSA, which supports the authors' view that the management training is an integral part of the effective industrial development strategy.This book is essential reading for scholars and researchers interested in economic development and industrial policy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Marketers need to create a mobile experience that is easily activated with the press of a thumb and that allows consumers to take action directly. Right now 80 percent of mobile marketing is just plain bad. It either doesn't work and has a high abandon rate, or doesn't fit into a brand's overall strategy. Michael Kelley is going to change all that. With his experience running top brand mobile campaigns, this book will show business owners, marketers, and advertising managers how to develop a campaign that gets results. All Thumbs provides a very simple yet practical guide to help companies ranging from small mom and pop shops to multinational corporations to build multi-level campaign-driven, mobile brand experiences designed for maximum effectiveness, while at the same time providing a strategic overview of how mobile marketing fits into an overall brand and media campaign""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How much more value can we create together in the market, together? What lies behind this ""joint value""? •  Second Law: The combination must be designed and managed to realize the joint value in reality. What partners and structures fit this goal best? How do we manage those elements that are the sources of the joint value? •  Third Law: Each participant must earn sufficient profits to reward its investment. How do we divide the joint value?

It's a place where Midwestern couples become uninhibited swingers, where shy schoolgirls morph into sexy strippers pulling in $1,000 a night, and where randy tourists come to score at more than just blackjack and craps. What happens here, stays here — and Vegas nightlife is hotter than it's ever been before.In Skin City, journalist and longtime Vegas resident Jack Sheehan goes beyond the bright lights to explore the dark thrills of the city's sex industry. Both lurid and fascinating, here is an unabashed look at the stripping, swinging, hustling, and hooking that have turned a desert gaming metropolis into the world's capital of lascivious entertainment. But more than a no-holds-barred expose, Sheehan's Skin City offers a connoisseur's catalogue of where to go for readers whose tastes run to the erotic — with everything from valuable pointers from lap dancers, call girls, and vice cops to porn star Jenna Jameson's list of her favorite Vegas strip clubs.

Regulatory hacking,Evan Burfield,business__economics,First published in 2018,/works/OL19751156W,/authors/OL7539656A/Evan_Burfield,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 310,"""Every startup wants to change the world. But the ones who truly do know something the others don't: how to make government and regulation work for them. As startups use technology to shape the way we live, work, and learn, they're taking on challenges in sectors like healthcare, infrastructure, and education, where failure is far more consequential than a humorous chat with Siri or the wrong shoes showing up on your doorstep. These startups inevitably have to face governments responsible for protecting citizens through regulation. Love it or hate it, we're entering the next era of the digital revolution: the Regulatory Era. The big winners in this era--in terms of both impact and financial return--will need a skillset you won't learn in business school or from most startup incubators: how to scale a business in an industry deeply intertwined with government. Here, for the first time, is the playbook on how to win this regulatory era. ""Regulatory hacking"" might sound like shorthand for ""cutting through red tape"", but it's really about finding a creative, strategic approach to navigating complex markets. Evan Burfield, cofounder of 1776, a Washington, DC-based venture capital firm and incubator specializing in regulated industries, has worked at the intersection of startups and government for over two decades. As an experienced entrepreneur and investor in dozens of startups operating in complex industries, Burfield has coached startups on how to understand, adapt to, and influence government regulation. Now, in Regulatory Hacking, he draws on that expertise and real startup success stories to show you how to do the same. For instance, you'll learn how... *AirBnB rallied a grassroots movement to vote No on San Francisco's Prop F, which would have restricted its business in the city. HopSkipDrive overcame safety concerns about its kids' ridesharing service by working with state government to build trust into its platform. 23andMe survived the FDA's order to stop selling its genetic testing kits by building trusted relationships with scientists who could influence the federal regulatory community. Through his fascinating case studies and interviews with startup founders, Burfield shows you how to build a compelling narrative for your startup, use it to build a grassroots movement to impact regulation, and develop influence to overcome entrenched relationships between incumbents and governments. These are just some of the tools in the book that you'll need to win the next frontier of innovation""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And here, they show companies how to create a pipeline of talent that will continuously fill their leadership needs-needs they may not even yet realize. The Leadership Pipeline delivers a proven framework for priming future leaders by planning for their development, coaching them, and measuring the results of those efforts. Moreover, the book presents a combination leadership-development/succession-planning program that ensures a steady line-up of leaders for every critical position within the company. It's an approach that bolsters the retention of intellectual capital as it eliminates the need to go outside for expensive ""stars,"" who will probably jump ship before they reach their full potential anyway.

This book--with its theory that economic and financial markets are in a continual equilibrium--is one of his books that still rings true today, given the current economic crisis. This Updated Edition clearly presents Black's classic theory on business cycles and the concept of equilibrium, and contains a new introduction by the person who knows Black best: Perry Mehrling. Mehrling goes inside Black's life to uncover what was occurring during the time Black wrote Business Cycles and Equilibrium, while also shedding light on what Black would make of today's financial and economic meltdown and how he would best advise to move forward.--From publisher description.

Mila Baker believes that most of today's leadership theories are old wines in new skins, and still rely on the leader-follower hierarchy. Yet the idea of hierarchy is breaking down everywhere in society, from politics, to religion, to social relationships--and most particularly in computers and networking. Why should leadership be any different? Baker's inspiration is the peer-to-peer model of computing, which is also mirrored in social networking and crowdsource technologies. Baker shows that a network with ""equipotent"" nodes of power--think peer leaders--are infinitely more powerful than ""client-server"" (i.e. leader-follower) networks. Yet the typical organizational design still harkens back to the days of punch-card computers. By creating organizations with leaders at all levels, architects of peer-to-peer organizations can build flexibility, resiliency and accountability. Baker still advocates the need for top level executives and senior leaders, but advises them to give up traditional notions of power and become focused on the health of the network rather than achieving personal leadership goals. Companies such as Gore and Herman Miller practice these principles and have achieved long-term success--Baker provides a structure to this approach that any organization can adapt""--  ""From a top scholar and corporate executive comes a new vision for leadership; the days of top down management are numbered, but the potential for peer-to-peer leadership is limitless""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Is culture like a ball and chain that actors must lug around as they pursue their material interests? Or, is culture like a tool-kit from which entrepreneurs can draw resources to aid them in their efforts? Or, is being immersed in a culture like wearing a pair of blinders? Or, is culture like wearing a pair of glasses with tinted lenses? Understanding the Culture of Markets explores how culture shapes economic activity and describes how social scientists (especially economists) should incorporate considerations of culture into their analysis. Although most social scientists recognize that culture shapes economic behavior and outcomes, the majority of economists are not very interested in culture. Understanding the Culture of Markets begins with a discussion of the reasons why economists are reluctant to incorporate culture into economic analysis. It then goes on to describe how culture shapes economic life, and critiques those few efforts by economists to discuss the relationship between culture and markets. Finally, building on the work of Max Weber, it outlines and defends an approach to understanding the culture of markets. In order to understand real world markets, economists must pay attention to how culture shapes economic activity. If culture does indeed color economic life, economists cannot really avoid culture. Instead, the choice that they face is not whether or not to incorporate culture into their analysis but whether to employ culture implicitly or explicitly. Ignoring culture may be possible but avoiding culture is impossible. Understanding the Culture of Markets will appeal to economists interested in how culture impacts economic life, in addition to economic anthropologists and economic sociologists. It should be useful in graduate and undergraduate courses in all of those fields""--  ""How does culture impact economic life?

For decades, people puzzled over the causes of the quakes, but by the time the nation began to recover from the Civil War, the New Madrid earthquakes had been essentially forgotten. In The Lost History of the New Madrid Earthquakes, Conevery Bolton Valencius remembers this major environmental disaster, demonstrating how events that have been long forgotten, even denied and  ridiculed as tall tales, were in fact enormously important at the time of their occurrence, and continue to affect us today. Valencius weaves together scientific and historical evidence to demonstrate the vast role the New Madrid earthquakes played in the United States in the early nineteenth century, shaping the settlement patterns of early western Cherokees and other Indians, heightening the credibility of Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa for their Indian League in the War of 1812, giving force to frontier religious revival, and spreading scientific inquiry. Moving into the present, Valencius explores the intertwined reasons -- environmental, scientific, social, and economic -- why something as consequential as major earthquakes can be lost from public knowledge, offering a cautionary tale in a world struggling to respond to global climate change amid widespread willful denial. Engagingly written and ambitiously researched -- both in the scientific literature and the writings of the time -- The Lost History of the New Madrid Earthquakes will be an important resource in environmental history, geology, and seismology, as well as history of science and medicine and early American and Native American history. - Publisher.

Similarly, South Korea is continuing to improve its environment, as well as its health care system, but struggles with gender inequality, poverty, and inequality.

Mittels einer profunden Analyse der Vermögensverteilung in Deutschland anhand der Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels wird in dieser Arbeit die gegenwärtige Verteilungssituation in Deutschland näher beleuchtet – insbesondere hinsichtlich einer Benachteiligung bestimmter sozioökonomischer Gruppen. Neben den gängigen Verfahren der Verteilungsanalyse wird ein Indikator entwickelt, mithilfe dessen eine integrierte Betrachtung der Stromgröße Einkommen und der Bestandsgröße Vermögen ermöglicht wird. Großteils ist die Konzentration der Vermögen auf divergierende Einkommenspositionen und Altersunterschiede zurückzuführen. Besonders benachteiligt sind Arbeiter und Solo-Selbstständige, Ostdeutsche, Personen mit Migrationshintergrund, kinderreiche Haushalte und Alleinerziehende. Die Evaluation des Mitarbeiterkapitalbeteiligungsgesetzes hinsichtlich der Vermögens- und verteilungspolitischen Effizienz ergibt, dass keine nennenswerte Vermögensdekonzentration zu erwarten ist.

Do you talk funny?,David Nihill,business__economics,First published in 2016,/works/OL20038449W,/authors/OL7610459A/David_Nihill,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 173,"""Public speaking can be terrifying. For David Nihill, the idea of standing in front of an audience was scarier than cliff jumping into a thorny pit of spiders and mothers-in-law. Without a parachute or advanced weaponry. Something had to change. In what doesn't sound like the best plan ever, David decided to overcome his fears by pretending to be a comedian called ""Irish Dave"" for one full year, crashing as many comedy clubs, festivals, and shows as possible. One part of the plan was at least logical: he was already Irish and already called Dave. In one year, David went from being deathly afraid of public speaking to hosting a business conference, regularly performing stand-up comedy and winning storytelling competitions in front of packed houses. And he did it by learning from some of the best public speakers in the world: stand-up comedians. Do You Talk Funny?: 7 Comedy Habits to Become a Better (and Funnier) Public Speaker shows how the key principles of stand-up comedy can be applied to your speaking engagements and presentations to make you funnier, more interesting, and better looking. (Or at least two of the three.) Whether you are preparing for a business presentation, giving a wedding toast, defending your thesis, raising money from investors, or simply want to take on something you're afraid of, this book will take you from sweaty to stage-ready. You'll learn how to: Craft a story and content that your audience will want to listen to; Find the funniest parts of your material and how to get to them faster; Deal with stage fright; Master the two most important parts of your performance: timing and delivery. Ten percent of the author's proceeds from this book will go to Arash Bayatmakou via Help Hope Live until he is fully back on his feet and thereafter to one of the many facing the same challenges after suffering a severe spinal cord injury""--   Read more Read less",11 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

A particular aim of this book is to broaden, deepen and critically reassert a postcolonial imagination in this domain. Through theoretical analysis and empirical insight, the individual chapters contribute to the defamiliarisation and decolonisation of core concepts and approaches to organizational inquiry, and offer positive alternative visions based on the assertion of indigenous knowledge. The book seeks to re-historicise the discipline and practice of management and organization studies with respect to the colonial encounter, and its lingering and changing forms. The assertion of indigenous forms of knowledge about management and organization is a central feature of Core-Periphery Relations and Organization Studies. The unfettered enunciation of indigenous perspectives is a crucial task and opportunity for challenging the core-periphery structures that constrain current disciplinary thinking about management and organization.

Using this definition, e-commerce is part of e-business-a company needs e-commerce to implement e-business. Utilizing e-commerce, however, does not mean that a company has transformed into an e-business. E-business is implemented only when a company changes its internal procedures to take advantage of the e-commerce technologies.Interest in the evolution (""e-volution"") of e-commerce into e-business is a growth field. With the early November announcement that GM and Ford were forming online marketplaces for their suppliers, they placed themselves at the center of new e-business ecosystems that will transform their entire way of doing business. Many firms are increasingly discovering opportunities to move away from simply selling products on the Internet to being able to reinvent their conventional supply chains (as in the auto makers' case) and to being able to offer custom-built products (as Dell Computers does now).

The first was Chile's experiment with peaceful socialist change under Salvador Allende; the second was the simultaneous attempt to build a computer system that would manage Chile's economy. Neither vision was fully realized—Allende's government ended with a violent military coup; the system, known as Project Cybersyn, was never completely implemented—but they hold lessons for today about the relationship between technology and politics. Drawing on extensive archival material and interviews, Medina examines the cybernetic system envisioned by the Chilean government—which was to feature holistic system design, decentralized management, human-computer interaction, a national telex network, near real-time control of the growing industrial sector, and modeling the behavior of dynamic systems. She also describes, and documents with photographs, the network's Star Trek-like operations room, which featured swivel chairs with armrest control panels, a wall of screens displaying data, and flashing red lights to indicate economic emergencies. Studying project Cybersyn today helps us understand not only the technological ambitions of a government in the midst of political change but also the limitations of the Chilean revolution. This history further shows how human attempts to combine the political and the technological with the goal of creating a more just society can open new technological, intellectual, and political possibilities. Technologies, Medina writes, are historical texts; when we read them we are reading history.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen und Solidarisches Bürgergeld - mehr als sozialutopische Konzepte,Thomas Straubhaar,business__economics,First published in 2008,/works/OL20929694W,/authors/OL912786A/Thomas_Straubhaar,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Hamburg University Press|Language German|Pages 220,"Thomas Straubhaar and Ingrid Hohenleitner outline the model of an unconditionally granted basic income. According to the authors, it can also be financed by Germany. They see the basic income as an opportunity to sustainably restructure the state budget and make the welfare state financially viable again for future generations. They show that new jobs of up to 1.17 million full-time jobs could be created, particularly in the low-wage sector. Michael Opielka sees the Althaus model as ""a kind of combination wage for all"". Part of the national income would be distributed to all. With a ""mixture of pragmatism and idealism"", the Solidarity Citizen's Income creates on the one hand a ""real"" labour market, but at the same time makes part-time work worthwhile and provides secure voluntary commitment and educational phases. With the Solidarity Citizen Income, wage differentiation in the lower income bracket no longer leads to poverty. The Solidarity Citizen Income of Dieter Althaus would be an important step on the way to more social solidarity, more subsidiarity and more (social) justice. Michael Schramm comes to this conclusion. In addition, the system of social security would be placed on an economically viable footing and the labour market and entrepreneurial forces would be stimulated.

Existing ""health insurance"" books focus only on public policy or consumers. Using the techniques outlined in this book, employers and their workers learn to save money on health insurance by migrating from group to individual plans at a total cost that is 20-60% lower for the same coverage (That's a savings of $4,000-$12,000 per year for a family of four). We are at the beginning of a huge transformation in the health insurance industry in which 120 million people are expected to move from group to individual insurance by 2025. Similar to the shift from defined benefit pensions to defined contribution 401(k) plans, the end of employer-provided health insurance will create opportunities for new entrants the way 401(k) plans led to the massive growth of Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The fundamentals of municipal bonds,Neil O'Hara,business__economics,First published in 2012,/works/OL16015215W,/authors/OL6965057A/Neil_O'Hara,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Wiley|Language English,"""The definitive new edition of the most trusted book on municipal bonds As of the end of 1998, municipal bonds, issued by state or local governments to finance public works programs, such as the building of schools, streets, and electrical grids, totaled almost $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt, a number that has only increased over time. The market for these bonds is comprised of many types of professionals--investment bankers, underwriters, traders, analysts, attorneys, rating agencies, brokers, and regulators--who are paid interest and principal according to a fixed schedule. Intended for investment professionals interested in how US municipal bonds work, The Fundamentals of Municipal Bonds, Sixth Edition explains the bond contract and recent changes in this market, providing investors with the information and tools they need to make bonds reliable parts of their portfolios.

This book supports the growing feminist literature that challenge the unrelenting focus on the suburban post-war housewife that has obscured the complexity of women's lives during this period and the gender ambiguities embedded in the post-war culture.In a first of its kind, this book provides a richer understanding of the sociology of the economics profession by presenting the oral histories of women economists who received the PhD's between 1950 and 1975. Recounting their stories about their post-war experiences as family members, students and professionals, we learn not only what it was/is like to be a woman and /or African-American in a white male dominated profession, but also how the profession operates, and what specifically is required for its improvement. By interviewing a wide range of female economists, Olsen and Emami have managed to present an impressive scope of philosophical perspectives, career paths, research interests, feminist proclivities, and observations about the profession and women's place within it.The accessible style and insightful contributions within Engendering Economics will appeal to academics and students within the fields of economics ad sociology, as well as all with an interest in gender.

Are these perhaps the small creatures that will survive and flourish after the great dinosaurs are gone? Let's hope so.' - James K. Galbraith, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs and University of Texas at Austin     'This book is simply a masterpiece on cooperativism for the xxi century. It outstandingly demonstrates why cooperatives are more resilient to the crisis and avoid falling into the dept trap and its implacable cohort of inhuman effects. A decisive contribution not only to economic democracy but also to Democracy as a political system.' - Yves Cabannes, University College London 'This is a timely and important book which both analyses current economic turmoil and shows how the crisis may foment new and more co-operative forms of enterprise. Anyone interested in advancing the cause of participatory ownership as one means of guarding against recurrent crises should read this book.'-- George Irvin, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London     'This book presents a thoughtful and exciting consideration of the roles cooperatives can play -- and should be expected to play -- today ... It deserves to be widely read and discussed within and across the boundaries that have long divided cooperative proponents and the general public.'-- Ian MacPherson, University of Victoria, Canada     'This book is a major step forward in understanding the working of co-operative economies. Its appearance could hardly have been more timely. At a point when the global financial system and the models of economic governance have been thrown into question, it shows how it is that co-operative financial systems are more crisis resistant than contemporary private banking, and how finance can be structured to service long term local and industrial growth rather than subject it to the imperative of short term profitability. More generally, the authors describe an architecture of co-operative governance that has not only been innovative and resilient but is particularly well suited to any post crisis world that is reshaped round multi stakeholder engagement.' - Robin Murray, LSE Global Governance and author of Co-operation in the Age of Google.

The present volume gives an introduction of basic concepts and methods in mathematical risk analysis, in particular of those parts of risk theory that are of special relevance to finance and insurance. Describing the influence of dependence in multivariate stochastic models on risk vectors is the main focus of the text that presents main ideas and methods as well as their relevance to practical applications. The first part introduces basic probabilistic tools and methods of distributional analysis, and describes their use to the modeling of dependence and to the derivation of risk bounds in these models. In the second, part risk measures with a particular focus on those in the financial and insurance context are presented. The final parts are then devoted to applications relevant to optimal risk allocation, optimal portfolio problems as well as to the optimization of insurance contracts.Good knowledge of basic probability and statistics as well as of basic general mathematics is a prerequisite for comfortably reading and working with the present volume, which is intended for graduate students, practitioners and researchers and can serve as a reference resource for the main concepts and techniques.

But what is it? And will it last? In Top Class Competitors Stephane Garelli - professor at IMD business school where he is also head of the World Competitiveness Centre, professor at the University of Lausanne, and former managing director of the World Economic Forum - defines competitiveness as the ability of a nation, company or individual to manage a set of disparate competencies to achieve prosperity. For instance, along with traditional policies a nation must tackle education and security to sustain economic development. Companies must manage soft issues such as brands to beat the competition. And individuals must reinvent themselves to survive. These fields of research did not exist until recently - now, competitiveness makes the link.   Top Class Competitors is a journey through the brave new world of competitiveness. What are its historical origins? How does it impact the management of a nation? How do companies thrive on it in an international environment? What is the impact on work structures and value systems? Above all, is there a competitiveness mindset? Exploring how competitiveness works, Stephane Garelli shows why competitiveness is the most powerful tool available to unleash new levels of prosperity for nations, profit for companies and success for people.

The headlines, and the statistics behind them, however, don't tell the whole story. The truth is, many women today are breadwinners; and these breadwinners are struggling. They are caught in a perfect storm of male-dominated culture at work, traditional social norms at home, and outdated schedules in the school. Mogul, Mom, & Maid takes an honest look at how women are balancing home life and career. The pressures of child rearing, coupled with an unfulfilling corporate culture, are too great to be ignored. Author Liz O'Donnell goes beyond statistics and tells the stories of women all across America who are juggling careers, motherhood, marriage, and households. Mogul, Mom, & Maid looks at the choices women are making, the options they have, and the impact these decisions have on themselves, their families, and the businesses that employ them""--  ""Mogul, Mom, & Maid takes an honest look at how women are balancing home life and career.

A great read.""  --PIETRA RIVOLI, author of The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy   ""Paul Midler takes us for a ride through the fastest-growing economy in the world, revealing what can--and sometimes does--go wrong when U.S. companies shift production to China. Working in the heart of China's export hub, in the country's southern region, he has the advantage of a front-row seat to the no-holds-barred games played between manufacturers and importers. He introduces us to a cast of real-life characters and tells his story with a mix of affection and skepticism for what is taking place in China today.

Suddenly, the ugly mudslinging between environmentalists and big business has abated, and these two previously opposed forces are now strange bedfellows in a race to head off climate change. How is this new frontier being shaped? Brian Dumaine is your guide in this intriguing look into the very near future filled with colorful and informative stories about the entrepreneurs, investors, and corporate mavericks who are managing to pull off the feat of combining economic growth and environmental protection to battle global warming. You'll read about:- The savvy investors: Why Warren Buffett is investing heavily in wind power; and why John Doerr, the venture capitalist and early backer of Google, is saying that ""green tech is bigger than the Internet and could be the biggest economic opportunity of the twenty-first century."" - The cars of the future: The competitively priced plug-in hybrids that will get 60 miles to the gallon, and the battle being waged by fifteen start-ups competing to capture the electric car market.- The fuels without fossils: New sources of energy from plants such as prairie grass and algae that could capture a big chunk of the $300 billion U.S. wholesale gasoline market.- The corporate mavericks: Companies such as Duke Energy and GE who are creating the low-carbon business models of the future, as well as cleaner ways to provide our power needs.- The energy-miser homes and buildings: The new Bank of America Tower in New York City and the green low- and middle-income homes being constructed by visionaries who were told it couldn't be done and still be affordable.- The ""thin film"" solar energy: How it is making the cost of heating a home comparable to traditional methods without emitting greenhouse gas. Plenty of obstacles still exist--among them resistance from the rich and powerful owners of the world's oil supply, developing nations such as China with their reliance on coal, and an American public reluctant to give up their McMansions, SUVs, and extreme air-conditioning. But the battle cry has been sounded. The green overhaul of the utility, energy, construction, shipping, and automobile industries is well on its way and--contrary to prevailing fears--the ultimate solutions will sustain the environment without demanding huge sacrifices to our contemporary comforts and lifestyles.From the Hardcover edition.

One of India's wealthiest men gives an insider's view into his country's dynamic transformation, revealing the forces and unique characteristics behind India's meteoric rise.The buzzword of the twenty-first century is India—and it's not just a story of software, outsourcing, and faraway call centers. With the economy soaring at 8 percent a year, India is a medical and pharmaceutical frontrunner, an R&D powerhouse, a rising manufacturing hub, and an up-and-coming cultural trendsetter in areas from fashion to film. And the world is taking note: Western companies from Lockheed Martin to McDonald's are moving in, Ford is setting up factories, Coca Cola is heading to the countryside in rickshaws, and research centers for Fortune 500 companies are popping up everywhere. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is forging close ties, as India has become a key strategic partner.Steel tycoon turned educator Vinay Rai, who now runs one of India's two private universities— with fifteen campuses nationwide—couples with geopolitical writer Melissa Rossi to map out the rising new India.

Business is about making money. Sustainability is about protecting the planet and the life forms on it. Business is measured in months, and quarters. Climate change, deforestation, and the reduction in biodiversity occur over decades or even centuries. Business is about maximising this year's profit. Sustainability often requires significant short term costs to secure a very long term benefit. It's difficult to bridge the gap. Strategy and Sustainability encourages its readers to move beyond the hype and takes a decidedly pro-business, fact based point of view, recognizing the complexity of the issues at hand and the strategic choices businesses can make. It blends the work of some of the leading academic thinkers in the field with practical examples from a variety of business sectors and geographies and offers a roadmap with which Sr. Management might think about engaging with the topic, not to save the planet but to fulfil its medium and long term responsibility to shareholders and other stakeholders""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It's a constant, in life and in business.  Its pace is increasing across the globe--and businesses and entities of all stripes must do more than keep up.  They must innovate and accelerate to succeed.  And yet people--many of the people that businesses rely on--are unnerved by change, often in ways they can't explain.  This difficulty in embracing the new hinders breakthrough change initiatives, slowing nearly 90 percent of them to a glacial pace or stopping them entirely.  It's a problem--perhaps the hardest problem--that innovative leaders face as they drive toward the future.  Now, in Stacking the Deck: An Operator's Manual for Leading Breakthrough Change, readers will find expert guidance and advice on how toeffectively and successfully lead and implement breakthrough change in their organizations--from wherever they stand.Through in-the-trenches stories of experienced leaders of bold, sweeping change in organizations from Intel to Pinkberry, from Asurion to Starbucks, Dave Pottruck, former CEO of Charles Schwab and winner of the Morningstar CEO of the Year award, walks readers through the social and emotional reality of leading others and all the ups and downs that can entail.  Stacking the Deck addresses the challenges leaders are likely to confront in driving and implementing change--and provides a 9-step plan to help leaders successfully organize and drive breakthrough change. Dave presents his nine step process for stacking the deck in favor of success developed over his more than thirty years of experience in leading many of the boldest changes in the financial services industry.Leading breakthrough change is certainly not for the faint of heart. But armed with the right insights, a time proven process, and perspective gained from leaders who have ""been there and done that"" success can be encouraged although never guaranteed. This book and its contents will help you stack the deck in favor of your ultimate success""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Great leaders realize that in order to thrive, they must overcome the epidemic of employee disengagement. Building a culture to overcome employee disengagement is even more important now than it was three years ago. When times were great, it was rather easy for leaders to overlook disengaged employees as long as the business was growing and numbers were being met. With smaller teams to perform the work, it is essential that employers get the most from employees by ensuring a culture of engagement.    As we emerge from the recession and businesses begin to hire again, employees will have options they haven't had in a few years. Employers may begin to see their best and brightest depart for other opportunities if a culture of disengagement has been allowed to exist. It will be imperative for leaders to focus on employee engagement in order to encourage good employees to stay when other opportunities arise, and to attract top talent when hiring resumes.    Engaged Leadership 2e will provide even more reasons for building a culture to overcome employee disengagement. Clint will address the impact high unemployment has had on employee engagement, and the impact it has had on those left behind doing the work of two people. He will also address the issues surrounding a lack of job security brought on by the global recession, and the growing impact of social media on employee engagement.    And finally, Clint will update the fable to make it more current, and will add on additional sections to update readers on where certain characters have ended up as a result of the current economic impact on the organization in the fable. He will also tie the updated fable to closely to Living for the Weekday, with the ultimate goal of tying the two books together in all his speaking and consulting""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However they often remain small, invisible and hampered by a lack of explicit support and license. In an increasingly knowledge-based economy, what we know, our thoughts, ideas, creativity, innovation and our willingness to share and collaborate, are critical for creating value for organisations and the individuals who work for them, and organisations are seeking ways of emulating the innovation and passion found present in start-ups and with entrepreneurs. Workplace communities provide a way to tap into this collective intelligence, engage people in a common sense of direction and provide the opportunity for unleashing 'intrepreneurship' across the organisation. The Workplace Community offers a structured, practical guide for understanding and developing creative and effective communities in the workplace, from introducing employees and managers to new ways of working, to measuring effectiveness and providing corrective interventions for those who haven't achieved the desired results.

In the face of continued urban expansion the countryside has become a major issue, its future development uncertain. Countryside Planning addresses these concerns and provides an in-depth study of the rural debate. Beginning with the key concepts and issues, the author sets out the context in which planning operates and how society has constructed its own images of the countryside. Using three theoretical perspectives the book decsribes the evolution of the current planning system and provides a basis for further discussion about the possible future for the countryside. In the wake of the recent Rural White Paper, the book includes the major issues that affect contemporary rural Britain including the current reforms of the CAP, the role of farmers as land managers, and the hypocrisy of sustainable and green tourism. Using boxed policy summaries throughout the text, as well as key question and answer sections in every chapter, the author treats policy and trends across the whole spectrum of countryside planning. Countryside Planning is an in-depth and authoritative analysis of rural policy and makes an important contribution to the countryside planning debate and the future of rural Britain.

A brand that was already established as a sign of identification and differentiation thus became a driver of social mediation to form a fictional relationship between companies and their end users. Initially, and in the end, the brand served to change the power relationships structuring commodities markets where products were sold in bulk. To account for this vast system of objects and brands, the book draws heavily on the generative trajectory of meaning stemming from the structural semiotics of Greimas obedience; it presupposes that meaning is produced by progressive enrichment from a constitutive core (core values) and gradually rises to the surface to its discursive implementation via objects and figurative elements.

Expatriates in China, aimed at both scholars and business professionals, draws from academic literature and explores the world of Western expatriates in the Chinese business context through the author's first-hand experience as an expatriate in conjunction with testimonials from interviewees. This study analyses numerous factors that can affect Western expatriates and their performance in China from the selection stage until after repatriation: pre-arrival linguistic and cultural training, expatriate recruitment and selection, culture shock, matters of international human resources management, expatriate identity issues, work practices, understanding 'the Chinese way' and the effective management of expatriate repatriation.

It traces the connections running from historical events to debates among economists, and from the ideas of academic writers to major experiments in economic policy. The treatment offers fresh perspectives on laissez faire, socialism and fascism; the Roaring Twenties, business cycle theories and the Great Depression; Institutionalism and the New Deal; the Keynesian Revolution; and war, nationalization and central planning. After 1945, the work explores the postwar revival of invisible-hand ideas; economic development and growth, with special attention to contrasting policies and thought in Germany and India; the gold standard, the interwar gold-exchange standard, the postwar Bretton Woods system and the Great Inflation; public goods and public choice; free trade versus protectionism; and finally fiscal policy and public debt""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, after capital globalization, shocks spread to markets almost immediately. Despite the increasing macroeconomic dangers that the situation generated at emerging markets in the South, nobody at the North was ready to acknowledge the pro-cyclicality of the financial system and the inner weakness of ?decontrolled? financial innovations because they were enjoying from the ?great moderation.? Monetary policy was primarily centered on price stability objectives, without considering the mounting credit and asset price booms being generated by market liquidity and the problems generated by this glut. Mainstream economists, in turn, were not majorly attracted in integrating financial factors in their models.

One out of twelve people in the world are employed by the tourism industry which contributes $6.5 trillion to the world's economy. To investigate the size and effect of this new industry, the author traveled the globe. She speaks to the Minister of Tourism of Zambia who thinks licensing foreigners to kill wild animals is a good way to make money and then to a Zambian travel guide who takes her to see the rare endangered sable antelope. She travels to Venice where community groups are fighting to stop the tourism industry from pushing them out of their homes, to France where officials have made tourism their number one industry to save their cultural heritage; and on cruises speaking to waiters who earn $60 a month, then on to Miami to interview their CEO. Her sharp depiction reveals travel as a product; nations as stewards. Seeing the tourism industry from the inside out, the world offers a dizzying range of travel options but very few quiet getaways. -- Provided by publisher.

This book, first published in French and updated here, however treats the 'new economy' as a discourse - one that is often misleading. In order to understand what happened during the internet bubble and the fuss that surrounded it, a central element - intellectual speculation - needs to be understood. New Economy, New Myth treats this speculation as a form of 'ultra-free-market' thinking. According to this line of thought, the internet and the digital revolution are acting as a sort of Trojan horse in spreading market deregulation across the globe. With so much having been written about the new economy, this book employs a mixture of academic rigour and readable prose and comes as a welcome relief. It will be an intriguing reading to those interested in the internet bubble - and the hyperbole that surrounded it.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Entrepreneurship and economic development in Hong Kong,Tony Fu-Lai Yu,business__economics,First published in 1997,/works/OL3360153W?edition=ia%3Aentrepreneurship00yuto,/authors/OL546034A/Tony_Fu-Lai_Yu,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1013310M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 240,"This is the first systematic economic study of the nature, operation and contribution of entrepreneurship to the growth of Hong Kong. From a new entrepreneurial perspective of economic development, the author argues that the success of Hong Kong is attributable principally to adaptive entrepreneurship: * product imitation, * small scale enterprise, * subcontracting, * spatial arbitrage. Using these entrepreneurial strategies, local manufacturers learned from foreign firms and imitated their products. By selling improved commodities at lower prices, they competed against the original suppliers from more advanced countries. Being alert to opportunities and responding rapidly to change, Hong Kong's entrepreneurs shifted their production activities from one product to another; from higher cost to lower cost regions; from traditional fishing and agriculture to manufacturing, and then to finance and other services. These entrepreneurial activities have brought about structural transformation in Hong Kong's economy, enabling the country to compete with advanced economies. This study concludes that any policy recommendation on economic development should be based on analysis that incorporates entrepreneurship and provides a reappraisal of the role of government in economic development.

Climate Justice - a voice for our future - responds to human adversity by mobilizing climate justice as legal justice. A first principles approach to constitutionalize legal justice helps to legitimize and realize a unified, transparent, comprehensible, accessible and responsive process that applies to all. Part one examines and unifies parameters of climate justice within the legal system. Part two develops a constitutional response to systematic system failure (injustice). Thorp then shows how to use the model to launch a process to develop an agreement applicable to all and with legal force under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The book will interest philanthropists and all interested in the future of humanity. It will appeal to climate justice movements, NGO constituencies, environmental groups, human rights advocates, governments, negotiators, businesses, and other decision-makers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But as valid as that declamation may be at a university, in the corporate world what passes for knowledge can be a killer.

The remaking of the mining industry,David Humphreys,business__economics,First published in 2015,/works/OL22313834W,/authors/OL8534485A/David_Humphreys,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""The emergence of China as a major economic power in the first decade of the millennium prompted the biggest commodity boom of modern times. Soaring prices gave rise to talk of a commodity 'super cycle' and induced a wave of resource nationalism in mineral-rich countries. It also stirred up concerns of supply shortages in mineral-consuming countries. The author, who served as chief economist at two of the world's largest mining companies during these years, describes how and why this resulted in a transformation - a 'remaking' - of the mining industry. The book tells of how the markets in which the industry operated changed, how the industry was restructured through acquisition and investment, and how a cast of new players from emerging economies arrived on the scene. With the boom now passed, the book concludes with some reflections on what the changes imply for the future of the industry and the environmental and political challenges it will face""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers Daring Greatly and The Gifts of Imperfection tells us what it takes to get back up, and how owning our stories of disappointment, failure, and heartbreak gives us the power to write a daring new ending. Struggle, Brene Brown writes, can be our greatest call to courage, and rising strong our clearest path to a wholehearted life""--  ""With her 2010 TED talk on the power of vulnerability (over 18 million views), her bestselling books on the transformative gifts of shame and vulnerability, and her inspiring call for wholehearted living, Brene Brown has changed the cultural conversation. Her work has been embraced by Oprah Winfrey and corporate leaders alike making her a highly sought after public speaker. For Brene, the conversation about vulnerability and shame naturally evolves into a discussion of bravery--its origins, its catalysts, its chemistry. How we are brave. What constitutes bravery. What activates the impulse to be brave. And how to recognize where our own ""hero's journey"" begins--in the depths of failure, disappointment, heartbreak, and grief--and how, once we grapple with our story, we are able to rise from those depths and determine how we want our story will end""--   Read more Read less",58 Want to read|2 Currently reading|9 Have read

His 'moment' has arrived.' -The Wall Street JournalIn his seminal work, Minsky presents his groundbreaking financial theory of investment, one that is startlingly relevant today. He explains why the American economy has experienced periods of debilitating inflation, rising unemployment, and marked slowdowns-and why the economy is now undergoing a credit crisis that he foresaw.Stabilizing an Unstable Economy covers:The natural inclination of complex, capitalist economies toward instabilityBooms and busts as unavoidable results of high-risk lending practices'Speculative finance' and its effect on investment and asset pricesGovernment's role in bolstering consumption during times of high unemploymentThe need to increase Federal Reserve oversight of banksHenry Kaufman, president, Henry Kaufman & Company, Inc., places Minsky's prescient ideas in the context of today's financial markets and institutions in a fascinating new preface. Two of Minsky's colleagues, Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, Ph.D. and president, The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, and L. Randall Wray, Ph.D. and a senior scholar at the Institute, also weigh in on Minsky's present relevance in today's economic scene in a new introduction.A surge of interest in and respect for Hyman Minsky's ideas pervades Wall Street, as top economic thinkers and financial writers have started using the phrase 'Minsky moment' to describe America's turbulent economy. There has never been a more appropriate time to read this classic of economic theory.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

At the heart of the book is the Internet-based StrengthsFinder' Profile, the product of a 25-year, multimillion-dollar effort to identify the most prevalent human strengths. The program introduces 34 dominant ""themes"" with thousands of possible combinations, and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. In developing this program, Gallup has conducted psychological profiles with more than two million individuals to help readers learn how to focus and perfect these themes. So how does it work? This book contains a unique identification number that allows you access to the StrengthsFinder Profile on the Internet. This Web-based interview analyzes your instinctive reactions and immediately presents you with your five most powerful signature themes. Once you know which of the 34 themes -- such as Achiever, Activator, Empathy, Futuristic, or Strategic -- you lead with, the book will show you how to leverage them for powerful results at three levels: for your own development, for your success as a manager, and for the success of your organization.""--Publisher description.

Cyprus and the financial crisis,John Theodore,business__economics,First published in 2015,/works/OL22313664W,/authors/OL8534425A/John_Theodore,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""The 2012-2013 economic crisis in the Republic of Cyprus is commonly attributed to a number of factors, including the exposure of Cypriot banks to over leveraged local property companies; the knock-on effect of the Greek government debt crisis; and international credit rating agencies downgrading the Cypriot government's bond credit status. What followed was unexpected and controversial: a bailout on condition of a one-time bank deposit levy on all uninsured deposits in the country's second-largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank; and on the uninsured deposits of large proportion of the island's largest commercial bank, the Bank of Cyprus.  Many have questioned the implications of Cyprus' ties with the Russian financial system, as well as the draconian and unprecedented bailout terms imposed on the Cypriot population by the Eurozone.  There has been little written from the Cypriot perspective on these events. This book presents a study of the events surrounding the recent Cypriot Financial Crisis and its impact on the Eurozone. It incorporates insights from leading protagonists in the Cypriot government and banking sectors and focuses on qualitative research to assess the events that formed the backdrop of the crisis. The book analyzes the policies of many public and private institutions and presents the crisis alongside other Eurozone bailouts to compare and contextualize the ongoing issues. Cyprus and the Financial Crisis also explains the political and historical backdrop of the events, including the wider Cypriot experience since the 1974 invasion, and the unravelling financial relationship between Cyprus, Greece and Russia. It incorporates the views of Cypriots from a wide and diverse spectrum, and presents the resilience of the island in fighting back to beat forecasts for recovery, helped by the Eldorado of gas finds off its southern shores.

Entrepreneurship and small business management are two very close and often overlapping disciplines. If entrepreneurship specifically refers to the dynamic process of creating a new business venture, small business management generally addresses various issues in organising and operating a small business. In practice however, a large part of the textbooks contents from both disciplines tend to cover similar issues such as small business start-up (starting from scratch, buying an existing business or operating a franchise), developing a business plan, selecting a legal form of organisation, marketing research and organising and financing the new venture.""--Publisher's website.

However, even as companies become increasingly inter dependent, strategic partnering today fails far more often than it succeeds because it is approached as an art instead of a science.  BP executive, Luc Bardin, presents a clear, easy to use model for partnering that has evolved from feedback and examples from the world's leading CEOs and companies. His model includes a practical, well tried set of rules and methods and treats partnering as a process. He provides a guide for the many aspects of cooperation, including selecting a strategic partner, building relationships, designing the partnership vision and plan, developing a core value proposition and how to measure outcomes.  Packed with case studies from leading Fortune 100 companies and personal interviews with their C Suite level executives, Strategic Partnering provides a useful roadmap for a successful partnership""--  ""Strategic Partnering - remove chance and deliver consistent success - is designed to take the guesswork out and provide you with a ground-breaking and fully encompassing system of rules and processes, to make your partnering strategy a vitally important and transformational reality. Supported by invaluable insights from a wealth of senior leaders across a range of leading global organizations, the book introduces a comprehensive and practical new model of demonstrated methodologies, to remove chance from the partnering process and help you target 100 per cent success. Whether you are a government official, board member, CEO, senior executive, account or procurement leader, marketer or a manager involved in value added relationships within your organization, then this book could be the 'vade mecum' to the development of your successful strategic partnering strategy and prove deeply 'transformational' to the way you think about, run and create value in your organization or business""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Vermieter dürfen jedoch Zuschläge für «gute Lagen» verlangen. Das Gesetz gibt in geradezu dogmatischer Weise vor, welche Straßenzüge zu welchen Zuschlägen berechtigen und greift damit stark in das regionale Preisgefüge und dessen Entwicklung ein. Diese Arbeit untersucht in einem Quasi-Experiment anhand von 32.000 Mietangebotsdaten die strukturellen Effekte dieses mietrechtlichen «Preisdiktats». In bestimmten Gegenden kommt es zu Umgehungsmechanismen, zu einer zweifelhaften Mieterselektion, und zur «Flucht aus dem Markt». Vermieter gehen dazu über, ihre Häuser als Eigentumswohnungen zu verkaufen. Das entzieht dem Mietmarkt das Angebot und spannt die Situation weiter an.

Economics and Utopia: Why the Learning Economy Is Not the End of History,Geoffrey Martin Hodgson,business__economics,First published in 1998,/works/OL1878913W?edition=ia%3Aeconomicsutopiaw00hodg,/authors/OL224952A/Geoffrey_Martin_Hodgson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL358825M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 337,"For many, the East European revolutions of 1989 and the disintegration of the USSR represented not only the overdue demise of Soviet-style communism, but also the obsolescence of all utopian ways of thinking. History has reached its end-state in the form of a victorious liberal-democratic capitalism and all attempts to imagine an alternative social order were now damned as both futile and quixotic. Economics and Utopia rejects this stifling dogma in the belief that utopian thinking is a necessary condition for the development of alternative solutions to the problems of the present and thus for historical progress.Economics and Utopia is emphatically not an attempt to breathe new life into existing utopian models, whether state socialist or neo-liberal, which are seen as misunderstanding the nature of learning and knowledge in a modern economy. The author's utopianism is based on an examination of the potential for an alternative future based on the growth of knowledge-intensive production, one whose feasibility would derive from its ability to respond to the needs of rapidly-changing industrial economies. More than just a consideration of economic alternatives, Economics and Utopia is also an important contribution to the critique of mainstream economics which is considered to be unable to understand the market system except in the most formal and abstract terms. Thus in order to imagine new worlds a change in our economic thinking is necessary, one that focuses on the relationship between learning and knowledge in economic systems, as well as on the institutional and cultural context of different economic models.

But these opportunities can't be found inside the walls of the traditional classroom. Instead, they lie in the myriad of educational options that provide the technical, vocational, and soft skills on demand in today's workplace, such as: -Professional certifications: Start your career faster in fields like bioscience aviation, culinary arts, and medical technology.-Associates degrees: Increase earning potential through inexpensive 2-year programs in subjects like civil engineering, environmental science, education, and nursing.-Apprenticeships: Earn while you learn under the direct supervision of a skilled expert. Far beyond the artisan trades, today's apprenticeships can be found at companies like Volkswagen and Siemens.-Occupational learning: Refresh or reboot your skill sets through on-the-job training or online education. In Job U, you'll learn about these paths to rewarding occupations; where to find them and how to parlay them into the best paying job in any field. And along the way, you'll meet individuals of all ages who have attained their ""dream jobs"" through a non-traditional education: from an emergency air paramedic, to a lead mechanic of a racecar team, to an engineer of complex gas turbine generators, to a bestselling cookbook author.

The largest pool of wealth in the world - a global total that is twice the world's total pension savings, and ten times the total of all the sovereign wealth funds on the planet - is still comprised of commercial assets that are held in public ownership. And yet, while this is the largest pool of assets in the world, is also one of the murkiest - what goes on inside them is often not even properly known by the governments who own them. In most countries this vast portfolio is both a fiscal and political burden on society. If professionally managed it could generate an annual yield of 2.7 trillion dollars, more than current global spending on infrastructure: transport, power, water and communications. While traditional state control of assets has often proved inefficient, privatization is not always a panacea, as it offers opportunities for quick enrichment, crony capitalism, outright corruption, or dysfunctional regulation. To privatise or nationalise is simply the wrong argument. What matters is whether those assets are managed effectively - in a way that can generate a return that can fund the much needed investments in infrastructure that will boost overall economic growth. Based on both economic research and hands-on experience from many countries, the authors argue that publicly owned commercial assets need to be taken out of the direct and distorting control of politicians and placed under professional management in a 'National Wealth Fund'. Such a move would trigger much needed structural reforms in national economies, thus resurrect strained government finances, bolster ailing economic growth and improve the fabric of democratic institutions.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In light of this, leading international corporations need to be staffed by the best possible executive talent from around the world. This talent revolution places a burden on business schools to offer highly focused learning, based on current and practical research. In addition, business schools face fierce competition in this sector, not least from the rapid growth in management education in India and South-East Asia. Thought Leadership Meets Business offers significant new insights into the factors that have led to the delivery of high-quality executive education at the top-ranking International Institute for Management Development (IMD). Drawing on the experience and wisdom gained by IMD President Peter Lorange over a distinguished career of more than twenty years, this book offers a powerful model for business school success.

Now, in Return on Character, Fred Kiel offers us the findings of a new study that tell us how to grow and develop that kind of extraordinary leadership. This groundbreaking book is based on Kiel's seven years of rigorous research into the ""black box"" that contains the little understood connection between character, leadership excellence, and organizational results. Grounded by nearly 9,000 employee observations on CEOs and their teams, Kiel offers solid evidence that character matters-leaders of strong character in his study achieved up to five times the ROA for their organizations than did leaders of weak character.  Most people want to believe that good character wins, but many hard-nosed executives and analysts are skeptical on that point. Kiel's evidence not only draws a hard and direct link between strong character and strong business results, his findings go on to identify the specific character habits of exceptional leadership and how they play a role in shaping every facet of the organization. Strong morals and good character aren't mere ""icing on the cake""; in Return on Character we learn how they are the primary ingredients in the decision-making processes that result in smart strategies, an innovative business model, and an engaged workforce.  Return on Character definitively reports a consistent, observable relationship between high character leaders and better business results. Crucially, the book also proves that anyone can build character-whether you're a current leader or an aspiring one-it's a habit that is developed and nurtured. The book offers a methodology you can use - with ideas and advice for assessing your own habits of character, along with solid techniques for improving them, as we simultaneously ""unlearn"" the habits that weaken our character-and our leadership model. So whether you're leading a large organization, a small business, or any group trying to reach an important goal, this book is a guide to help you drive success""--  ""What does it mean to have character as a business leader, and how does this lead to company success? Many have given partial answers to these questions, but very few have gone beyond individual stories to attempt a rigorous, research-based account of what really constitutes character and how it translates to performance. Leadership author and adviser Fred Kiel provides a fascinating and useful breakdown of the elements of character; how they are formed and how character is different from emotional intelligence and personality; and then an illuminating picture of how character fits into a larger ""CEO value chain"" necessary for success""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Just as traditional contingent claims, a weather derivative has an underlying measure, such as: rainfall, wind, snow or temperature.  Nearly $1 trillion of the U.S. economy is directly exposed to weather-related risk.  More precisely, almost 30% of the U.S. economy and 70% of U.S. companies are affected by weather.  The purpose of this monograph is to conduct an in-depth analysis of financial products that are traded in the weather market. Presenting a pricing and modeling approach for weather derivatives written on various underlying weather variables will help students, researchers, and industry professionals accurately price weather derivatives, and will provide strategies for effectively hedging against weather-related risk.  This book will link the mathematical aspects of the modeling procedure of weather variables to the financial markets and the pricing of weather derivatives.  Very little has been published in the area of weather risk, and this volume will appeal to graduate-level students and researchers studying financial mathematics, risk management, or energy finance, in addition to investors and professionals within the financial services industry.

Now, in Free, he makes the compelling case that in many instances businesses can profit more from giving things away than they can by charging for them. Far more than a promotional gimmick, Free is a business strategy that may well be essential to a company’s survival.The costs associated with the growing online economy are trending toward zero at an incredible rate. Never in the course of human history have the primary inputs to an industrial economy fallen in price so fast and for so long. Just think that in 1961, a single transistor cost $10; now Intel’s latest chip has two billion transistors and sells for $300 (or 0.000015 cents per transistor—effectively too cheap to price). The traditional economics of scarcity just don’t apply to bandwidth, processing power, and hard-drive storage.Yet this is just one engine behind the new Free, a reality that goes beyond a marketing gimmick or a cross-subsidy. Anderson also points to the growth of the reputation economy; explains different models for unleashing the power of Free; and shows how to compete when your competitors are giving away what you’re trying to sell.In Free, Chris Anderson explores this radical idea for the new global economy and demonstrates how this revolutionary price can be harnessed for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike.

How do national institutional differences condition economic performance, public policy, and social well-being? Will they survive the pressures for convergence generated by globalization and technological change? These have long been central questions in comparative political economy. This book provides a new and coherent set of answers to them.  Building on the new economics of organization, the authors develop an important new theory about which differences among national political economies are most significant for economic policy and performance. Drawing on a distinction between 'liberal' and 'coordinated' market economies, they argue that there is more than one path to economic success. Nations need not converge to a single Anglo-American model. They develop a new theory of 'comparative institutional advantage' that transforms our understanding of international trade, offers new explanations for the response of firms and nations to the challenges of globalization, and provides a new theory of national interest to explain the conduct of nations in international relations.  The analysis brings the firm back into the centre of comparative political economy. It provides new perspectives on economic and social policy-making that illuminate the role of business in the development of the welfare state and the dilemmas facing those who make economic policy in the contemporary world. Emphasizing the 'institutional complementarities' that link labour relations, corporate finance, and national legal systems, the authors bring interdisciplinary perspectives to bear on issues of strategic management, economic performance, and institutional change.  This pathbreaking work sets new agendas in the study of comparative political economy. As such, it will be of value to academics and graduate students in economics, business, and political science, as well as to many others with interests in international relations, social policy-making, and the law.    --back cover   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Monday, October 19, 1987, was by far the worst day in Wall Street history. The market fell 22.6 percent--almost twice as bad as the worst day of 1929--equal to a loss of nearly 5,000 points today. But Black Monday was more than just a one-day market crash; it was seven years in the making and threatened the entire U.S. financial system. Drawing on superlative archival research and dozens of original interviews, the award-winning financial journalist Diana B. Henriques weaves a tale of ignored warnings, market delusions, and destructive decisions, a drama that stretches from New York and Washington to Chicago and California. Among the central characters are pension fund managers, bank presidents, government regulators, exchange executives, and a pair of university professors whose bright idea for reducing risk backfires with devastating consequences. As the story hurtles toward a terrible reckoning, the players struggle to avoid a national panic, and unexpected heroes step in to avert total disaster. For thirty years, investors, bankers, and regulators have failed to heed the lessons of Black Monday. But with uncanny precision, all the key fault lines of the devastating crisis of 2008--breakneck automation, poorly understood financial products fueled by vast amounts of borrowed money, fragmented regulation, gigantic herdlike investors--were first exposed as hazards in 1987. A First-Class Catastrophe offers a new way of looking not only at the past but at our financial future as well.""--Jacket.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf|Language English|Pages 352","A passionate, articulate argument detailing how the United States political system has failed to adapt to the economic challenges of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.The American economy is in peril. It has fallen hostage to a casino of financial speculation, creating instability as well as inequality. Tens of millions of workers are vulnerable to layoffs and outsourcing, health care and retirement burdens are increasingly being shifted from employers to individuals. Here Kuttner debunks alarmist claims about supposed economic hazards and exposes the genuine dangers: hedge funds and private equity run amok, sub-prime lenders, Wall Street middlemen, and America's dependence on foreign central banks. He then outlines a persuasive, bold alternative, a new model of managed capitalism that can deliver security and opportunity, and rekindle democracy as we know it.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Despite the vast English-speaking population, the Philippines has largely been neglected in the area of management publications. This ethnographic account examines the management practices of a plant in the Philippines, and links its findings to the varieties of capitalism analysis of the Philippines.  This volume also addresses an 'inequality trap' - the concept highlighted by the World Bank in its World Development Report of 2006. The author presents realities and offers insights to the very central issues of globalization, such as inequalities and global management.  Though the Philippines has been neglected in management publications, this does not mean that it does not have much to offer to management literature. Philippine society, known to have experienced long-running and severe inequalities, is caught in a so-called inequality trap and is an alarming model for future societies where globalization is currently taking place. Globalization and the Inequality Trap presents the opportunities available, as well as the limits of ""good"" global management practices in a society which has been experiencing prolonged and severe inequalities. The insight presented in this account may sound the alarm for many other countries in the world, which are similarly challenged by the widening and prolonging of inequalities created by globalization.

This book brings together academics, members of European institutions, and regional and national level policymakers in order to assess the performance and direction of EU Cohesion policy against the background of the most significant reforms to the policy in a generation. Responding to past criticisms of the effectiveness of the policy, the policy changes introduced in 2013 have aligned European Structural and Investment Funds with the Europe 2020 strategy and introduced measures to improve strategic coherence, performance and integrated development.        EU Cohesion Policy: Reassessing performance and direction argues that policy can only be successfully developed and implemented if there is input from both academics and practitioners. The chapters in the book address four important issues: the effectiveness and impact of Cohesion policy at European, national and regional levels; the contribution of Cohesion policy to the Europe 2020 strategy of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth; the importance of quality of government and administrative capacity for the effective management of the Funds; and the inter-relationships between institutions, territory and place-based policies.        The volume will be an invaluable resource to students, academics and policymakers across economics, regional studies, European studies and international relations.

Hlupic argues that organizations need to change their leadership style to place value on knowledge sharing, where decisions are made on the basis of knowledge instead of formal position, to create more value and improve innovation and engagement. Supported by numerous case studies from trials in major multinational corporations, The Management Shift offers practical advice on how managers can diagnose leadership issues in their organization which are affecting engagement and performance, and how to succeed at integrating human and structural relationships within current business organisational practices.

The first section of the book accordingly examines the foundations of Walras's work.  These include his philosophical and methodological approach to economic modeling, his views on human nature, and the basic components of his general equilibrium models. The second section examines how the influence of his ideas has been manifested in the theorizing of his successors, surveying the models of theorists such as H. L. Moore, Vilfredo Pareto, Knut Wicksell, Gustav Cassel, Abraham Wald, John von Neumann, J. R. Hicks, Kenneth Arrow, and Gerard Debreu.

Without formal education he trained himself in classical economics and developed a theory of a ""single tax"" suggestive of the work of the earlier French economistes. Academic economists of his day rejected his work, but it enjoyed great public popularity in the United States, Europe, Australia and other places. He was more widely read than any other early American economist. History has seen his rehabilitation at the hand of modern economists who have reviewed and analyzed his work in great detail. There is much specialized literature on many specific facets and aspects of George's work, but we lack a book which provides an overview of George's economics and of this historic rehabilitation.

Its mission: to explore novel technological solutions to the world's persistent social problems. Together with his team, he invented electronic devices for under-resourced urban schools and developed digital platforms for remote agrarian communities. But after a decade of designing technologies for humanitarian causes, Toyama concluded that no technology, however dazzling, could cause social change on its own. Technologists and policy-makers love to boast about modern innovation, and in their excitement, they exuberantly tout technology's boon to society. But what have our gadgets actually accomplished? Over the last four decades, America saw an explosion of new technologies - from the Internet to the iPhone, from Google to Facebook - but in that same period, the rate of poverty stagnated at a stubborn 13%, only to rise in the recent recession. So, a golden age of innovation in the world's most advanced country did nothing for our most prominent social ill. Toyama's warning resounds: Don't believe the hype! Technology is never the main driver of social progress. Geek Heresy inoculates us against the glib rhetoric of tech utopians by revealing that technology is only an amplifier of human conditions. By telling the moving stories of extraordinary people like Patrick Awuah, a Microsoft millionaire who left his lucrative engineering job to open Ghana's first liberal arts university, and Tara Sreenivasa, a graduate of a remarkable South Indian school that takes children from dollar-a-day families into the high-tech offices of Goldman Sachs and Mercedes-Benz, Toyama shows that even in a world steeped in technology, social challenges are best met with deeply social solutions.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To achieve this, they introduce a new, unique and complete approach to communication: The Campaign It! model.  Developed over several decades of influencing change at the highest levels and in different environments, the Campaign It! model is tried and tested, and in the book, Parker and Bernard offer proof that it works.  Their basic tenet is that whenever there is an outcome people need to achieve they will have to inform, persuade and gain agreement from others. Their model, the ""campaigning approach,"" makes this possible: it provides a plan and a structure to develop communications; it enables people to help themselves, their families, their businesses and/or their communities""--  ""Campaign It! provides a new definition and understanding of what makes a cause. It explains why, in our modern society, a communications campaign is the most powerful way to achieve success. And it demonstrates how it is possible to create and apply an irresistible communications campaign to any aspect of our professional and personal lives. Whatever the situation, we always need to influence others if we are to achieve our goals. Campaign It! can help you do that. It's written by leading professionals who demonstrate that communications can be created in such a way that the message becomes powerful and compelling. At the heart of every successful campaign is a cause that motivates and drives a desire to succeed. With such a cause anyone can apply the Campaign It! model to devise a communications campaign to create success""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This interdisciplinary collection?spanning the disciplines of engineering, law and planning?draws helpfully on a range of practical and theoretical perspectives. It is the collaborative effort of leading experts in the fields of infrastructure project initiation and financing, and is based on international research conducted by the University of Melbourne, Universitas Indonesia and Universitas Gadjah Mada.  The volume opens with a macroscopic perspective, outlining the broader economic situations confronting Indonesia and Australia, before adopting a more microscopic perspective to closely examine the issues surrounding major infrastructure investment in both countries. Detailed case studies are provided, key challenges are identified, and evidence-based solutions are offered. These solutions respond to such topical issues as how to overcome delays in infrastructure project initiation; how to enhance project decision-making for the selection and evaluation of projects; how to improve overall efficiency in the arrangement of project finance and governance; and how to increase the return provided by investment in infrastructure. Special focus is given to proposed improvements to the portal cities of Indonesia in the areas of major infrastructure project governance, policies, engagement, operation and processes.  By rigorously investigating the economic, transport, finance and policy aspects of infrastructure investment, this book will be a valuable resource for policy makers and government officials in Indonesia and Australia, infrastructure investment organisations, and companies involved in exporting services between Indonesia and Australia. This book will also be of interest to researchers and students of infrastructure planning and financing, setting a solid foundation for subsequent investigations of financing options for large-scale infrastructure developments.""

Even the odds,Karen Firestone,business__economics,First published in 2016,/works/OL20038456W,/authors/OL276485A/Karen_Firestone,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 187,"""In Even the Odds, Karen Firestone explains how risk assessment plays a prominent role in all aspects of life. We may all define risk, and our tolerance for it, somewhat differently, but we might all agree it plays a pivotal role in guiding us toward an optimal outcome. As a long-time investment advisor, Firestone has grown accustomed to interpreting risk on a daily basis. She has developed four core tenets of risk-taking we can all apply to anticipating, evaluating, and responding to the risks we face in our business, investing, and personal lives. These tenets are right-sizing; right-timing; relying on skill, knowledge, and experience; and staying skeptical about numbers, promises, and forecasts. Firestone's approach is both practical and accessible to individuals who are making important decisions, such as embarking on new career or life changes, starting or running an enterprise, making a sizable investment, or deciding how to balance across a full portfolio of assets. The book is rich with anecdotes and examples of how many prominent leaders in their fields encountered and dealt with risk along the way. Firestone also shares her own successes and failures, in particular when she decided to risk it all-a fabulous career managing billions of dollars at a premium investment company, her reputation, and the security at home that comes with a strong and stable job-to go out on her own. Even the Odds helps us understand the broader implications of risk-and how it guides our decision-making-so that we can improve outcomes across multiple facets of our lives, from our businesses and investments, to the personal choices we make.""--  ""Karen Firestone reveals her four core tenets of sensible risk-taking in Even the Odds.

Based on research from Wharton's Executive Development Program (EDP), this concise guide identifies the common challenges that arise when people work together as a group and provides key guidance on breaking through the barriers to peak performance. Committed draws its insights from the EDP's living lab: an intensive two-week simulation during which executive-level participants run complex global businesses. The authors have observed over 100 teams collaborating and competing for over 100 combined years in this intense environment. It has yielded fundamental insights about teamwork: what usually goes wrong, what frequently goes right, and the methods and techniques that will help you access your team's full potential. These insights have been distilled into a simple, repeatable process that you can start applying today. Getting teams engaged and aligned is hard. Committed will give you the tools you need to deal with all of the familiar teamwork challenges that get in the way: organizational politics, delegation, coordination, and aligning skills and motivation. Using vivid stories and examples from the worlds of business, sports, and non-profits, it will teach you how to: Understand the dynamics of successful teams Achieve peak performance using a research-backed methodology Gain expert insight into why most teams underperform Learn the critical points common to all great teams Committed gives you the perspective you need to combine the right people with the right way of collaborating to achieve extraordinary results""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Needs are at the root of our triumphs and setbacks in our personal lives and affect many of the decisions that fuel the economy.  But most marketers, researchers, product designers, advertisers and executives do not fully consider needs, and end up using emotion in ways that may be misguided and shortsighted.  The central premise of this book is that with a revised understanding of the science and philosophy behind human needs, businesses will be better equipped to provide long-term satisfaction for their customers, as well as grow their bottom lines. Mark uncovers a framework that will help businesses both identify human needs and incorporate this perspective into strategy, and then focuses each chapter on a specific vital emotional need: Self-expression, Belonging, Recognition, Control, Care and Growth. In short, understanding how human needs manifest in the marketplace require businesses to learn from the perspectives of sociology, ethnography and psychology - neurological, behavioral, clinical and psychodynamic - blended together with traditional consumer insights make a bold case for a needs-based paradigm shift in the business community.

Few, if any, of the providers or recipients of such advice can truly claim to understand the well--springs of such liquidity and the transmission mechanisms through which it impacts asset prices.   This groundbreaking new book explores the belief that at the core of liquidity there is a force which exerts individuals to effect a financial transaction when they would not otherwise do so.  Understanding this force of compulsion is a key to understanding a financial market when it appears to be behaving irrationally. This book will enable new and seasoned investors to develop an understanding of the factors, so that costly mistakes can be avoided without the lesson of experience.

Scholars of globalization have mainly concentrated on describing the global reach of companies, as well as their outward openness. They have, to a large extent, neglected the other side of the coin: the strength of the companies' national roots and the inward restrictions that are still widely imposed by their nation-states. The Limits to Globalization examines this neglected side of globalization. The limits are explored through four major themes. First, the enduring characteristics of national business systems are highlighted. Second, the significance of national roots and local markets in the strategies of multinational companies is illustrated. Third, cultural and social barriers to globalization are demonstrated. And, fourth, the changing relations between business and politics in the interconnected world are discussed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It applies economic methodology - theoretical and empirical - with political analysis to the study of domestic and transnational terrorism. Included in the treatment are historical aspects of the phenomenon, a discussion of watershed events, the rise of modern-day terrorism, examination of current trends, the dilemma of liberal democracies, evaluation of counterterrorism, and analysis of hostage incidents. Rational-actor models of terrorist and government behavior and game-theoretic analysis are presented for readers with no prior theoretical training. Where relevant, the authors display graphs using the data set International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events (ITERATE), and other data sets.

On the software side, it examines the general trend toward cloud computing. It provides important examples of this rapidly emerging trend as well as guidance on how to use the cloud to make software available and to store large amounts of data.Demonstrating the savings and increased business resiliency that can result from green computing, this book offers C-suite executives, senior IT management, project managers, suppliers, and market analysts with the tools required to understand why you need to act, how to act, what to buy, when to do it, and who should act""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Finding productive ways to work across the generation gap is essential, and the organizations that do this well will have significant strategic advantages over those that don't. Millennials & Management: The Essential Guide to Making It Work at Work addresses a very real concern of large and small businesses nationwide: how to motivate, collaborate with, and manage the millennial generation, who now make up almost 50% of the American workforce. The key is to change Boomer attitudes from disbelief and derision to acceptance and respect without giving up work standards. Using real world examples, author Lee Caraher gives leaders data-driven steps to take to co-create a productive workplace for today and tomorrow.

Crisis and embodied innovations,Volodymyr Ryaboshlyk,business__economics,First published in 2014,/works/OL23201524W,/authors/OL8794101A/Volodymyr_Ryaboshlyk,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English|Pages 194,"""A curious thought that the innovations embodied in machinery and other fixed capital, besides growth, also drive recession has received a solid confirmation. From now on, output and employment decline and subsequent jobless recovery can be forecasted in explicit terms of figures and timing rather than of probabilities and possibilities of crisis onset; the short and long runs having been integrated together at that. For these reasons many traditional simplified theories are challenged and it is proposed a Constructive Framework capable to catch turning points in the economy instead of mere extrapolations and trends. The policy implication is that crises are unavoidable, but they are quite predictable and their depth is manageable. In addition to this, the classical and neoclassical views on how an innovative economy works and fluctuates are converged and reconciled. As it has turned out, general equilibrium is not altogether general - objective marginalism suppresses a subjective one - the Keynesian easy money is a paradoxical example of doing the right thing for the wrong reason; and financial bubbles are pricked by real structural changes, not the other way around.  This book gives an impetus for development of economic science for another 100 years and provides a fresh perspective on crises and innovation, making it indispensable reading for scholars, researchers, policy-makers and professionals""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Once Managerialism had transcended the simplicity of managing companies it mutated into an ideology infiltrating nearly every eventuality of human life. Delivering a comprehensive definition of Managerialism, this book traces Managerialism's origins from simple factory administration to its current form as full-blown ideology that has infected private lives, public and educational institutions, society, the art, the economy, and even democracy. Today thousands of managers have graduated from Managerialism's main training facilities, namely management schools. They are ready to spread Managerialism's one-dimensional, anti-democratic, and authoritarian ideology that everything and anything can be managed through a specific set of managerial knowledge found in management studies. But there are also challenges to Managerialism. There are images of what lies beyond Managerialism. These post-managerial images include a rejection of the human and environmental destructiveness of Managerialism. And there are ways to create human and sustainable post-managerial living conditions""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Market Loves You: Why You Should Love It Back,Jeffrey A. Tucker,business__economics,First published in 2019,/works/OL27701163W,/authors/OL1387680A/Jeffrey_A._Tucker,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37785674M-M.jpg,"Publish Date May 13, 2019|Publisher  American Institute for Economic Research|Language English|Pages 454","The marketplace is commonly described as brutish, greed-based, cutthroat, or unrelentingly exploitative. The Market Loves You – Jeffrey Tucker’s latest collection of evocative observations of everyday products, services, and life in the market – rejects this characterization. He argues that benevolence characterizes trading relationships, entrepreneurship, work contracts, and the effects of decisions by market players. These are a civilizing, evenly lovely, institutions that embed complex human relationships that extend all over the world, involving potentially billions of people.  Every unforced decision to trade represents a spark of insight, a hope for a better future, and the instantiation of a human relationship that affirms the dignity of everyone involved, he writes. Sometimes that relationship is personal; it is even more awesome to consider the enormously complex impersonal relationships that make up the vast global networks of exchange that make our lives wonderful.  We take the results for granted because they are so much part of our daily experience. If they suddenly went missing, any aspect of what we depend on to live a better life, we would experience demoralization and even devastation. The lights go out. The gas stations close. The shelves are empty. The doctors run out of medicine. There is no one to fix the plumbing, no one to repair the heater, no one to do the surgery on my heart. This is a world that is less lovely than the world of plenty we’ve come to expect.  The institutional setting in which human relationships become real in our lives is the market. This does not entail reducing human life to dollars and cents. It is about the recognition that our value as human beings is bound up with our associations with others, our trading relationships, and the opportunities we have to value and be valued by others. Looked at this way, the moral aesthetic of the market is lovely. It fosters love. It needs love.  “Economics, love, and life – these are all the same topic in the creative intelligence of Jeffrey Tucker. His writing sweeps you into a world of beautiful stories about the material world, infused with his gift for seeing the underlying human element in every exchange (as well as the brutality of the political means of social control). His new hymn to market forces brings what economics too often lacks, a vivid celebration of life and love as real human beings experience it. To see the world as Tucker does is a gift that few writers in economics have ever possessed.” ~ Helio Beltrão, President, Mises Institute Brazil  ""If you want to understand the plain sense of real economics, as against the fairy tales of fake economics, Tucker is your main man. In scores of charming little essays, free of pomp or pretense, he brings you to understand how a free people can live without coercion. He's a liberal 2.0, a sweet egalitarian, a generous, open-hearted spirit, yet realistic and tough-minded, too."" ~ Deirdre McCloskey, University of Illinois at Chicago  “Jeffrey Tucker is always a delight to read because he understands and appreciates the market’s invisible heart as well as its invisible hand.” ~ Art Carden, Samford University  “Jeffrey Tucker writes with a rare mix of economic understanding, historical awareness, philosophical depth, and unaffected humanity. And oh, also on display in these pages is a fearlessness in going to wherever the logic of his reasoning brings him. I learned something important from each of the 91 essays collected here.” ~ Donald Boudreaux, George Mason University   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We argue that if the heir to the family firm has no talent for managerial decision making, dynastic management is a failure of meritocracy that reduces a firm's Total Factor Productivity. We present a simple model that studies the macreconomic causes and consequences of dynastic management. In our model, the incidence of dynastic management depends, among other factors, on the imperfections of contractual enforcement. A plausible calibration suggests that, via dynastic management, poor contract enforcement may be a substantial contributor to observed crosscountry differences in aggregate Total Factor Productivity.

The time-series properties of aggregate consumption: implications for the costs of fluctuations,Ricardo Reis,business__economics,First published in 2005,/works/OL5812648W,/authors/OL1424002A/Ricardo_Reis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|Language English,"""While this is typically ignored, the properties of the stochastic process followed by aggregate consumption affect the estimates of the costs of fluctuations. This paper pursues two approaches to modelling aggregate consumption dynamics and to measuring how much society dislikes fluctuations, one statistical and one economic. The statistical approach estimates the properties of consumption and calculates the cost of having consumption fluctuating around its mean growth. The paper finds that the persistence of consumption is a crucial determinant of these costs and that the high persistence in the data severely distorts conventional measures. It shows how to compute valid estimates and confidence intervals. The economic approach uses a calibrated model of optimal consumption and measures the costs of eliminating income shocks. This uncovers a further cost of uncertainty, through its impact on precautionary savings and investment. The two approaches lead to costs of fluctuations that are higher than the common wisdom, between 0.5% and 5% of per capita consumption.""

Based upon over a decade of global research and consulting, Joseph E. McCann and John W. Selsky outline five capabilities highly agile and resilient systems must possess. They must be: Purposeful, Aware, Action-Oriented, Resourceful, and Networked. In addition the authors illustrate how these capabilities can be assessed across four levels--individuals, teams, organizations, and their business ecosystems.  The goal is to develop these capabilities in tandem so that the individual, team, organization and ecosystem have High AR--not just greater agility or resiliency, but both high agility and high resiliency.  The authors outline balanced development strategies for creating High AR that can be used to master turbulent environments for competitive advantage and sustained performance  Includes cutting-edge concepts and examples that take readers from the latest advances in neuro-science and executive wellness to global supply chains and innovation strategy. Contains illustrative examples and vignettes from leading organizations including Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, TECO Energy, Shell Oil, Walmart, and others  Most important, McCann, and Selsky deliver a unique and practical perspective that helps organization leaders make sense of the dynamic world in which they operate""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A large and rapidly growing literature in political economics attempts to answer these questions. But so far there is little consensus on the answers and disagreement on the appropriate mode of analysis.  Combining the best of three separate traditions -- the theory of macroeconomic policy, public choice, and rational choice in political science -- Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini suggest a unified approach to the field. As in modern macroeconomics, individual citizens behave rationally, their preferences over economic outcomes inducing preferences over policy. As in public choice, the delegation of policy decisions to elected representatives may give rise to agency problems between voters and politicians. And, as in rational choice, political institutions shape the procedures for setting policy and electing politicians. The authors outline a common method of analysis, establish several new results, and identify the main outstanding problems.    --back cover   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But this fail-fast, hit-or-miss, step-and-pivot, or tech-first philosophy can leave a trail of destruction and loss in its wake. It can be like a random walk in the forest--without a compass. This book is about helping the great entrepreneurs find true north. Henry Kressel and Norman Winarsky--technologists, inventors, and investors with stellar track records--have an approach for those who wish to create a market-leading company that will make an impact on the world: a disciplined and staged approach they've used to launch, invest in, and develop dozens of successful companies--and to create whole new markets. The method they describe takes the entrepreneur by the hand, step-by-step, through the critical stages of development of a great venture, from concept to acquisition or public offering, to being a mature company seeking to maintain its culture of innovation. It is a guide by innovators and for innovators, with approaches that are timeless. If You Really Want to Change the World is your guide to creating massively successful ventures. Drawing on the authors' experiences as well as those of their partners from around the world, Kressel and Winarsky share the stories of their triumphs and misses as of a way of demonstrating their method and inspiring their readers. They guide entrepreneurs and innovators in companies of all scale-start-ups, research institutions, government agencies, and corporations--on how to execute with the aim of creating companies that can change the world.

Three dots to represent Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Three arrows to show direct flights. Problem solved, and the picture made it easy to sell Southwest Airlines to investors and customers.Used properly, a simple drawing on a humble napkin is more powerful than Excel or PowerPoint. It can help crystallize ideas, think outside the box, and communicate in a way that people simply ""get"". In this book Dan Roam argues that everyone is born with a talent for visual thinking, even those who swear they can't draw.Drawing on twenty years of visual problem solving combined with the recent discoveries of vision science, this book shows anyone how to clarify a problem or sell an idea by visually breaking it down using a simple set of visual thinking tools – tools that take advantage of everyone's innate ability to look, see, imagine, and show.THE BACK OF THE NAPKIN proves that thinking with pictures can help anyone discover and develop new ideas, solve problems in unexpected ways, and dramatically improve their ability to share their insights.

We dive down to see coral reefs, not realizing that an ingredient in our sunscreen feeds a virus that kills the reef. We wear organic cotton t-shirts, but don't know that its dyes may put factory workers at risk for leukemia.  In Ecological Intelligence, Daniel Goleman reveals why so many of the products that are labeled green are a ""mirage,"" and illuminates our wild inconsistencies in response to the ecological crisis.Drawing on cutting-edge research, Goleman explains why we as shoppers are in the dark over the hidden impacts of the goods and services we make and consume, victims of a blackout of information about the detrimental effects of producing, shipping, packaging, distributing, and discarding the goods we buy.But the balance of power is about to shift from seller to buyer, as a new generation of technologies informs us of the ecological facts about products at the point of purchase. This ""radical transparency"" will enable consumers to make smarter purchasing decisions, and will drive companies to rethink and reform their businesses, ushering in, Goleman claims, a new age of competitive advantage.

This book focuses on the key factor which is identified as sustaining them, namely that of leadership. Leadership in organizations is currently understood primarily from a perspective based on systems thinking which underlies theories of organizational culture, practice and learning. Leadership is seen to be an attribute of the individual and the leadership role is that of articulating values, missions and visions and then persuading others to adhere to them.Increased complexity in organization has occurred in human history many times before: for example, the Greek ""polis"" of Athens, the military defence of increasingly large areas of land based on aristocracy and monarchy, national states with democratic elections and representative bodies. Accompanying these changes there have always been intense debates resulting in new understandings of leadership and ethics. We are at such a point now.This volume argues for an ethics of participative self-organization. The author holds that this means the end of ""business ethics"" as we know it today.  In the past we have focused on the choices of individual leaders. In today's highly complex organizations we are now coming to understand the nature of the emergence of leadership. This means that we can no longer understand ethics simply as such choice in planning and action. This will necessarily include understanding more about the nature of risk and conflict, spontaneity and motivation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ob klassische Trainee-Ausbildung oder Selbständigkeit in der entdeckten Markt-Nische: Berufsorientiert studieren ermuntert dazu, seinen Werdegang selbst in die Hand zu nehmen.""

Tarcher/Penguin|Language English,"Using Solomon’s life and teachings as a foundation, Bruce Fleet offers today’s readers a unique, well-grounded, proven method of wise investing.Solomon was more than just a character in the Bible— he was the richest man who ever lived. If we could learn from him directly, today, what would he teach us about how to grow in riches and knowledge? And how can we relate his life and wisdom to the society and successful financial planning of our contemporary world? Bruce Fleet’s The Solomon Secret brings together instructional parables highlighting the wisdom of history’s wealthiest and wisest man, with practical and sound financial advice for twenty-first-century readers.In the bestselling tradition of The Richest Man in Babylon, The Solomon Secret follows King Solomon as he mentors his young protege, Abidan, on the seven basic principles of life and how they influence financial success. Each of these parables illustrates a key principle that Abidan must discover before he can garner more wealth and happiness, and is then proceeded by Fleet’s masterful application of these principles to the reader’s life and to the most urgent and essential financial questions of our time. Fleet, a successful financial adviser and owner of a large investment firm, draws from the time-honored and historically proven wisdom of the life of the ancient king to offer—through the siphon of his own talent and perspective—the very best in financial strategies for today’s challenging economic climate.An accessible and effective mix of teaching stories with powerful financial lessons, The Solomon Secret is a highly readable, informative guide to becoming wealthy and wise.

While hospitals and health systems ationwide have laid people off or are closing their doors, Scripps is financially healthy, has added almost 5,000 employees, and has developed a reputation as a marquee employer, recognized year after year by Fortune Magazine, Working Mother, the AARP, and othersas a ""Best Places to Work."" What are the secrets to this remarkable story, and what can other leaders and businesses learn from Van Gorder's success as a leader?Van Gorder traces his track record to his background as a California police officer, and The Frontline Leader shares the leadership techniques learned from his service, grounded in the philosophy of responsibility, honesty, and public service learned as a member of the force. Police work is about protecting the community, making it a better place, educating citizens, developing warm and caring relationships, and ultimately doing the right thing, not the convenient thing, so as to give citizens someone to look up to and believe in. Businesses who follow these same principles lay the groundwork for lasting sucecss. As much as companies talk about accountability and spend millions on ""corporate social responsibility"" programs, managers seldom understand what practical steps to take for an ethic of service that makes accountability meaningful. The Frontline Leader exposes readers to specific tactics and implementation steps they can use starting today to take responsibility, inspire others, achieve breakout results for their organization and move up into higher positions. By understanding and deploying these steps, readers learn that cultivating a deep personal practice of accountability isn't just the right thing to do but also the most effective and profitable path a leader can take. They understand that daily practices that seem unrelated to the running of organizations can in fact confer surprising business advantage. Armed with these techniques, The Frontline Leader will help anyone become a better leader""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It provides a systematic comparison of investment efficiency among wholly and partially state-owned, wholly and partially foreign-owned, and domestic privately owned firms, conditioning on their sector, location, and size characteristics. It finds that even after a quarter-of-century of reforms, state-owned firms still have significantly lower returns to capital, on average, than domestic private or foreign-owned firms. Similarly, certain regions and sectors have consistently lower returns to capital than other regions and sectors. By our calculation, if China succeeds in allocating its capital more efficiently, it could reduce its capital stock by 8 percent without sacrificing its economic growth (and hence could raise its household consumption and deliver a faster improvement to its citizens' living standard).

Already, world water supplies are inadequate to meet demand, and the problem is going to get much worse in the years ahead. The World Bank estimates that 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and about 50 percent of the world's hospital beds are populated by people who have contracted water-borne diseases. If present consumption rates continue, in 25 years the world will be using 90 percent of all available freshwater. To address the problem, trillions of dollars will need to be invested in water infrastructure projects. And while the problems are most acute in developing and rapidly growing economies, there are huge water infrastructure needs in industrialized countries, as well. In the U.S. alone, it's estimated that more than $1 trillion will be needed for water and wastewater infrastructure projects. In Planet Water, water investment expert Steven Hoffmann explains the dynamics driving the water crisis and identifies investment opportunities in various sectors of the water industry. Hoffman provides investors with the knowledge and insights they need to make informed investments in water utilities, as well as companies providing water treatment services; infrastructure services; water monitoring and analytics; and desalination services. He also discusses mutual funds and ETFs that specialize in water stocks. Investing in the water industry is certainly no pie-in-the-sky idea. Over the past five years, many water stocks have exploded in value and water stocks as a whole have outperformed the S&P 500 by a substantial amount. In Planet Water, Hoffmann provides investors with everything they need to profit from this fast-growing industry in the years ahead.

Many of the richest energy-producing regions of the world, such as the Middle East, Russia and Central Asia, are unstable and torn with conflict. New fast-growing energy consumers, such as China, are significantly changing the geopolitics of energy resources. Billions of the world's poorest suffer the insecurity of energy poverty or fail to benefit from the abundant energy resources that enrich political elites and companies. And our planet is increasingly under pressure because of our continued dependence on fossil fuels. It is easy to see why energy security has risen to the top of the political agenda and looks set to stay there. In this book, Roland Dannreuther offers a new and comprehensive approach to understanding energy security. Drawing on the latest research in security studies, he treats energy security as a value that is continually in dynamic conflict with other core values, such as economic prosperity and sustainability. The different physical properties of the key energy resources - coal, oil, gas, nuclear and renewables - are of course critical for the differing manifestations of energy insecurity. But it is the social, economic and political contexts, developed over time and place, which are essential for a fuller appreciation of contemporary energy challenges. In highlighting the history and politics of energy security and the critical role played by power and justice in framing these debates, this incisive and cutting-edge analysis is a go-to introduction for students grappling with the complexities of energy security today.

Creating a ledger on data, a blockchain makes it possible to designate the owner of each piece of data, to trade data pieces, and to market them. This book examines the formation of markets for various types of data from the theory of market quality proposed and developed by M. Yano. Blockchains are expected to give data itself the status of a new production factor. Bringing ownership of data to the hands of data producers, blockchains can reduce the possibility of information leakage, enhance the sharing and use of IoT data, and prevent data monopoly and misuse. The industry will have a bright future as soon as better technology is developed and when a healthy infrastructure is created to support the blockchain market.

Animal spirits with Chinese characters,Mark A.

This is an important prerequisite to achieving its long-sought transition from extensive to intensive growth. Such a transformation would clearly require removing much of the economic power now enjoyed by local governments while at the same time hardening the budget constraints of the current system's principal beneficiaries. Such changes are unlikely in the absence of political reform. This title highlights the importance of China's investment booms and busts for both the Chinese and the world economy, describes the origins and evolution of the investment cycle during the command economy period. It will show how the animal spirits of the command economy era have been transformed by the introduction of capitalist economic institutions. In order to do so, the author carefully considers the banking system, which more often than not is on the losing side of these bets, a major source of speculative flows into the stock and property markets and the counter-cyclical monetary policy. Concluding, DeWeaver analyzes the use of administrative measures to manage the economy, which still work in much the same way as they did during the command economy period. Ending an investment boom continues to be primarily a matter of introducing new policies or the more strict enforcement of existing ones. And stimulus remains mainly a matter of policy relaxation - particularly the relaxation of financial sector prudential regulation. ""--  ""Animal Spirits with Chinese Characteristics is the first detailed account of the investment booms and busts that drive China's business cycles. The book looks first at the causes of these fluctuations, then examines the central government's countercyclical policy responses. The author shows that the volatility of Chinese investment is primarily the result of perverse incentives inherited from the command-economy era. Beijing's most effective countercyclical policies therefore still take the form of ad hoc administrative interventions. Contrary to popular belief, Beijing cannot ""fine tune"" the economy. It also stands little chance of transitioning to a less volatile ""mode of growth.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
