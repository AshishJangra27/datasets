Almost all medical specialties involve the use of biomaterials, and research plays a key role in the development of new and improved treatment modalities. This volume focuses on several current trends in tissue engineering, remodelling and regeneration. Leading researchers describe the use of nanomaterials to create new functionalities when interfaced with biological molecules or structures. In addition to coverage of basic science and engineering aspects, a range of applications in bionanotechnology are presented, including diagnostic devices, contrast agents, analytical tools, physical therapy applications, and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. The use of polymers, alloys, and composites, or a combination of these, for biomaterials applications in orthopaedics is also explored. These contributions represent essential reading for the biomaterials and biomedical engineering communities, and can serve as instructional course lectures targeted at graduate and post-graduate students.Includes the latest results in highly interdisciplinary aspects of the field such as synthetic morphogens and promorphogens in tissue regeneration, the use of restriction enzymes, and endothelial cell response to metalsPresents cutting-edge research on scaffold design and processing for bone tissue engineering, and biodegradable and biocompatible composites in orthopaedic applicationsDiscusses state-of-the-art developments in treatment and diagnosticsHighlights practical aspects of rapid prototyping in developing new implantsOrganized for use as instructional course lectures  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They also discuss his scientific work and the quantum revolution. It contains many pictures, the paper written by Bohr ""On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules"", and two excerpts of his Nobel prize lecture delivered in 1922. The Einstein-Bohr discussions on the causal description of nature vs quantum theory's uncontrollable interactions can also be studied with this volume. Reading the notes in the margins is recommended to enhance and/or complement your understanding of Bohr's charisma as a person and as a scientist. An extensive volume, perhaps reading the first half is sufficient to reach the intended meaning, but completing the entire book will take you to Bohr's views on politics and philosophical ideas.

In this bold and controversial book, Hakim explores the applications and significance of erotic capital, challenging the disapproval meted out to women and men who use sex appeal to get ahead in life. Social scientists have paid little serious attention to these modes of personal empowerment, despite overwhelming evidence of their importance. In Erotic Capital, Hakim marshals a trove of research to show that rather than degrading those who employ it, erotic capital represents a powerful and potentially equalizing tool-one that we scorn only to our own detriment""   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Youth sports isn't just orange slices and all-star trophies anymore. It's 14-year-olds who enter high school with a decade of football experience, 9-year-olds competing for national baseball championships, 5-year-old golfers who shoot par, and toddlers made from sperm donated (for a fee) by elite college athletes. It's a year-round ""travel team"" in every community--and parents who fear that not making the cut in grade school will cost their kid the chance to play in high school. In short, a landscape in which performance often matters more than participation, all the way down to peewee basketball.Much as Fast Food Nation challenged our eating habits and Silent Spring rewired how we think about the environment, Tom Farrey's Game On will forever change the way we look at this desperate culture besotted by the example of Tiger Woods. An Emmy award-winning reporter, Farrey examines the lives of child athletes and the consequences of sorting the strong from the weak at ever earlier ages: fewer active kids, testier sidelines, rising obesity rates, and U.S. national teams that rarely win world titles.He dives into the world of these games that are played by more than 30 million boys and girls, and along the way uncovers some surprising truths. When the very best athletes enter organized play. The best approach to coaching them. And the powerful influence of wealth and genetics. Farrey has written a surprising, alarming, thoughtful, and ultimately empowering book for anyone who wants the best for the newest generation of Americans, as athletes and citizens.From the Hardcover edition.

Her mother has brought her up in near isolation, teaching her about plants and nature and language--but not about life. Especially not how she came to have her own life, and who her father might be.When Aslaug's mother dies unexpectedly, everything changes. For Aslaug is a suspect in her mother's death. And the more her story unravels, the more questions unfold. About the nature of Aslaug's birth. About what she should do next. About whether divine miracles have truly happened. And whether, when all other explanations are impossible, they might still happen this very day.Addictive, thought-provoking, and shocking, Madapple is a page-turning exploration of human nature and divine intervention--and of the darkest corners of the human soul.From the Hardcover edition.

Knopf|Language English,"From the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos comes his most expansive and accessible book to date—a book that takes on the grandest question: Is ours the only universe?  There was a time when “universe” meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of math.  Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality’s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. And, with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining, Greene tackles the core question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?  Sparked by Greene’s trademark wit and precision, The Hidden Reality is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of reality—a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.

It then focuses on the use of photons in various selected fields of modern natural and life sciences. It bridges disciplines such as physics, chemistry, earth- and materials science, proteomics, information technology, photoelectrochemistry, photosynthesis and spintronics. Advanced light sources and their use in natural and life sciences are emphasized and the effects related to the quantum nature of photons (quantum computing, teleportation) are described. The content encompasses among many other examples the role of photons on the origin of life and on homochirality in biology, femtosecond laser slicing, photothermal cancer therapy, the use of gamma rays in materials science, photoelectrochemical surface conditioning, quantum information aspects and photo-spintronics. The book is written for scientists and graduate students from all related disciplines who are interested in the science beyond their immediate research field. It is meant to encourage interdisciplinary research and development in an age where nanoscience results in a convergence of formerly more disparate science.

Over the past fifty years a steady flow of experimental and theoretical papers on deuteron photodisintegration and its inverse reaction demonstrates the continuing interest in this fundamental process. This book contains an almost exhaustive review of the theoretical approaches employed to evaluate two-body photodisintegration of the deuteron at low and intermediate energies. Moreover, a critical survey of all the experiments concerning this process is given and the most accurate data are selected in order to compare the experimental results with the theoretical ones. Many information can be taken from this review, in particular that the current theory is able to describe the experimental data pretty well in the energy region below the pion production threshold, while more precise experimental data and improved theoretical calculations are needed in and above the delta-resonance region. Moreover, the role of meson exchange currents and isobar degrees of freedom is clearly seen in this process, the importance of different approximations in the calculations is clarified and the necessity of studying polarization observables is stressed.

It can be read by students from the third year on and will leads them to a level where they can start reading the current research literature. The book gives a thorough introduction to the field-theoretic techniques required for renormalization. Special effort has been devoted to simplifying combinatorial proofs as much as possible by using generating function techniques. A renormalization group differential equation is used to study the flow of Wilson's effective action. This differential equation technique, developed during the last few years, is used to give simple but complete proofs of renormalizability theorems.

In the past, this type of technology was developed in connection with military techniques by certain particular research organizations. For this reason, researchers of materials in general have had less opportunity to make use of the technology. The conventional technology of shock compression has now been established, and is recognized as being remarkably useful as a means of materials science study. The feasibility of shock compression technology is dealt with in this book, as well as the latest research results for general material scientists. The shock synthesis of ceramics and intermetallic compounds, as well as shock compression behavior, are also described.

The dramatic results of the major international laboratories and groups working in this subject are presented. The majority of the participants agree that a quantum confinement effect and a good passivation of the surface crystallites are responsible for the observed luminescence properties. New characterisation techniques are for the first time presented as a comprehensive survey of the theoretical models. Both efficient and wavelength tunable electroluminescence are demonstrated using liquid contacts and a cathodic injection system. Localised cathodoluminescence in a scanning electron miscroscope and a scanning tunneling microscope is also presented. This book demonstrates that a consensus is emerging on the origin of the visible luminescence of highly porous Si. This novel nanostructure is extending our knowledge into a new area of solid state physics.   Read more Read less,0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Concepts in Surface Physics"" provides a tutorial treatment of the main concepts of the physics of crystal surfaces. Emphasis is placed on simplified calculations - and the corresponding detailed analytical derivations - that are able to throw light on the most important physical mechanisms. More rigorous techniques, which often require a large amount of computer time, are also explained. Theory is compared with experimentwhere possible, with the experimental methods being described from a theoretical rather than a technical viewpoint. Topics treated include thermodynamic and statistical properties of clean and absorbate covered surfaces, atomic structure, vibrational properties, electronic structure, and the theory of physisorption and chemisorption.

The observables are calculated within a nonrelativistic framework but with inclusion of lowest-order relativistic effects. Explicit meson exchange currents and isobar configurations as manifestation of subnuclear degrees of freedom are included in the calculation. The sensitivity of the various polarization observables with respect to subnuclear degrees of freedom, to electric and magnetic multipole contributions and to a variety of realistic potential models are systematically investigated. Thus this atlas provides the most detailed and systematic survey on polarization observables of this important process. It allows to analyse the different dynamical properties of the np-system as contained in the various observables and, therefore, will be useful for both theoretical studies and for the planning and evaluation of experiments as well. It serves in addition as an important supplement to the recent general review on deuteron photodisintegration by A. Arenhövel and M. Sanzone (Few-Body Systems, Suppl. 3).

This information has thus far been scattered throughout numerous journals and reference sources. This handbook brings together a wide range of information on the experimentally determined properties of the alkali halides. Some theoretically derived parameters have also been included. All the important literature from 1950 to 2000 has been surveyed.

They interact selectively with electrons in atoms and molecules and can be used to study atomic physics, chemical reactions, surfaces and solids, and biological entities. Over the past 20 years, synchrotrons have emerged as powerful sources of soft X-rays for experimental use. A new, third generation of synchrotron light sources is scheduled to start operation over the next few years, beginning in 1993. These facilities are distinguished by their ultra-low emittance electron beams and by their undulators -- precisely engineered magnetic devices that cause the electrons passing through them to produce highly coherent X-rays and ultraviolet light of unprecedented spectral brightness. This volume emphasizes third-generation sources that produce light in the 10 eV--10 KeV energy range. It describes potential applications ranging from the purely scientific to the commercially viable and includes chapters on the practical aspects of designing undulators and beam line optics. Unique in its coverage, the book is a vital addition to the library of any scientist who needs information on the world's most advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques. (ABSTRACT) This volume emphasizes the applications of new third generation synchrotron radiation sources that produce light in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray range of the spectrum. The unprecedented brightness of this light enables experiments to be conducted with greatly increased spatial and spectral resolution. Scientists can exploit these properties for imaging and spectroscopic applications that until now were impossible or impractical. Prominent researchers in the field describe these applications and others made possible by the light's pulsed time structure and polarization. The volume also includes chapters on the practical aspects of designing undulators and beam line optics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It presents a variety of theoretical tools as well as important results for two-level and semiconductor media, many of which could only be found in the original literature or in specialized monographs up to now. An important feature of the text is that it reveals the close connection between many seemingly unrelated or only distantly related topics, such as probe absorption, four-wave mixing, optical instabilities, resonance fluorescence, and squeezing. The introductory chapters deal with selected aspects of classical radiation theory, classical nonlinear optics, and quantum mechanics. Then semiclassical light-matter interactions involved in laser theory, optical bistability and instabilities, saturation spectroscopy, phase conjugation, and coherent transients are discussed. The final chapters treat aspects of quantum optics that require the quantization of the electromagnetic field, including spontaneous emission, resonance fluorescence, ""nonclassical fields"" and squeezing, and the quantum theory of the laser. The second edition contains a significant number of changes designed to improve clarity. A new section has been added on the theory of resonant light pressure and the manipulation of atomic trajectories by light. The photon-echo problem has been reformulated to reveal its relationship to four-wave mixing.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Mathematical Methods of Quantum Optics,Ravinder Rupchand Puri,physics,First published in 2001,/works/OL19886284W?edition=ia%3Amathematicalmeth00puri_000,/authors/OL7574849A/Ravinder_Rupchand_Puri,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27073243M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 289","This book provides an accessible introduction to the mathematical methods of quantum optics. Starting from first principles, it reveals how a given system of atoms and a field is mathematically modelled. The method of eigenfunction expansion and the Lie algebraic method for solving equations are outlined. Analytically exactly solvable classes of equations are identified. The text also discusses consequences of Lie algebraic properties of Hamiltonians, such as the classification of their states as coherent, classical or non-classical based on the generalized uncertainty relation and the concept of quasiprobability distributions. A unified approach is developed for determining the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level atom interacting with combinations of quantized fields under certain conditions. Simple methods for solving a variety of linear and nonlinear dissipative master equations are given. The book will be valuable to newcomers to the field and to experimentalists in quantum optics.

As a field it is truly interdisciplinary, but this confronts the would-be entrant with the difficulty of becoming familiar with the basic theories and applications: the area is not covered in any undergraduate or graduate scientific curriculum. The present work commences with a history of tribology and micro/nanotribology, followed by discussions of instrumentation, basic theories of friction, wear and lubrication on nano- to microscales, and their industrial applications. A variety of research instruments are covered, including a variety of scanning probe microscopes and surface force apparatus. Experimental research and modelling are expertly dealt with, the emphasis throughout being applied aspects.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 273,"""A physicist explains daily phenomena from the mundane to the magisterial. Take a look up at the stars on a clear night and you get a sense that the universe is vast and untouchable, full of mysteries beyond comprehension. But did you know that the key to unveiling the secrets of the cosmos is as close as the nearest toaster? In Storm in a Teacup, Helen Czerski provides the tools to alter the way we see everything around us by linking ordinary objects and occurrences, like popcorn popping, coffee stains, and fridge magnets, to big ideas like climate change, the energy crisis, or innovative medical testing. She guides us through the principles of gases (""Explosions in the kitchen are generally considered a bad idea. But just occasionally a small one can produce something delicious""); gravity (drop some raisins in a bottle of carbonated lemonade and watch the whoosh of bubbles and the dancing raisins at the bottom bumping into each other); size (Czerski explains the action of the water molecules that cause the crime-scene stain left by a puddle of dried coffee); and time (why it takes so long for ketchup to come out of a bottle). Along the way, she provides answers to vexing questions: How does water travel from the roots of a redwood tree to its crown? How do ducks keep their feet warm when walking on ice? Why does milk, when added to tea, look like billowing storm clouds?

Most of the relevant literature is reviewed with particular emphasis on the approach developed by the authors. It explains most of the experimental data and allows the extraction of information about microscopic transport processes and parameters from equilibrium transport data. This work treats electronic transport in the mentioned type of semiconductors and in particular in a-Si:H and a-Ge:H. From elementary concepts the theory is developed towards higher degrees of completeness and sophistication. Further refinements for coping with the complexity of real systems are given. The comparison of theory with experiment is an important part of the book.   Read more Read less,0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In recent yearsstudies of heterostructures and superlattices have predominated, and this emphasis is reflected in these proceedings. The contributions concentrate on experiments using transport and optical methods, but recent theoretical developments are also covered. Special attention is paid to the quantum Hall effect, including the problem of edge currents, the influence of contacts, and Wigner condensation in the fractional quantum Hall effect regime. The 27 invited contributions by renowned expertsprovide an excellent survey of the field that is complemented by numerous contributed papers.

Donnelly,physics,First published in 1998,/works/OL19850497W?edition=ia%3Aflowatultrahighr00donn,/authors/OL883402A/Russell_J._Donnelly,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27039166M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1998|Publisher  Springer New York|Language English|Pages 466,"Because of their extremely low viscosity, liquid helium and ultra-cold helium gas provide ideal media for fundamental studies of fluid flow and turbulence at extremely high Reynolds numbers. Such flows occur in aerospace applications (satellite reentry) and other extreme conditions, where they are difficult to study. A cryogenic-helium wind tunnel would allow one to model these flows in a laboratory at much more benign conditions. Such studies have not been feasible because, using these fluids in a wind tunnel requires more liquid helium than has readily been available. However, the capacity of the refrigerators installed at several physics laboratories that supply liquid helium for particle accelerators (such as the one intended for the SSC in Texas or the one at Brookhaven National Laboratory) is so great that some of the liquid helium or the ultra-cold helium gas may also be used for fluid dynamics studies. The chapters in this book survey the challenges and prospects for research on fluid flows at high Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers using cryogenic helium. They cover a wide range of topics: from refrigeration and instrumentation to theories of superfluid turbulence. The chapters are largely based on contributions to a workshop held at Brookhaven, but these have all been brought up to the state of the art in late 1997; in addition, several chapters contain entirely new material. This book will be of interest to physicist interested in fluid dynamics, mechanical engineers interested in turbulent flows and transport, and naval and aerospace engineers.

The main topics concern the transport of water and solutes in soils and porous media; the mechanics of soil erosion by wind and water, processes of energy exchange and mass transfer between plants and the atmosphere; turbulent and convective processes in the atmosphere including wind flow over complex terrain and pollutant dispersal; and processes of filtration and sedimentation. Both theoretical and practical aspects of each topic are discussed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This is the first comprehensive review of the technique, dealing with a broad range of issues including mixing and acceleration processes, material removal mechanisms, process optimization and fluid mechanics. Explanations are given as the book follows the development of an abrasive water jet machining process, from tool generation through to machining results, supervision and control. This methodical journey through the field is marked by drawings, graphs and tables, many of which are being published here for the first time. Though the book is written at an academic level, it focuses very much on practical applications, which reflects the authors' extensive involvement with both laboratory research and industrial practices.

Our main part deals with the biology of ageing, while other examples are the functioning of the immune system, the structure of DNA, the fluctuations on the stock market, theories for sociology and for World War II. Are leaky water faucets similar to our heartbeats? Throughout the book we emphasize microscopic models dealing with the action of individuals, whether they are cells of the immune system or traders speculating on the currency market. Complete computer programs are given and explained for biological ageing. The references try to introduce the expert from the covered other fields to the relevant physics literature; and they also show the physicists the way into the biological literature on ageing.

Much of the available literature is concerned with linear concepts and models. Recent work has begun to consider the limitations and extensions of such models. Here special emphasis is given to larger motions where nonlinear effects are important. Buckling (or divergence) static equilibria, limit cycles and flutter oscillations are considered in some depth. Experienced practitioners and scholars as well as those students aspiring to a research career will find the book of interest.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ludwig Prandtl,Johanna Vogel-Prandtl,physics,First published in 2005,/works/OL23497685W,/authors/OL8012163A/Johanna_Vogel-Prandtl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen,"When Ludwig Prandtl took up the Chair of Applied Mechanics at Göttingen University in 1904, the small university town became the cradle of modern fluid mechanics and aerodynamics. Not only did Prandtl found two research institutions of worldwide renown, the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Strömungsforschung, but with the so-called ‘Göttingen School’ he also established an exceptionally fertile line of scientific thinking, unique for its special balance of intuition for physics and mathematical precision. The scientific methods developed by Prandtl and his pupils are manifested in numerous dissertations, monographs and textbooks that now rate as classics and hence belong to the fundamental works on fluid mechanics. Yet many of these publications have long been out of print and inaccessible for study. The series Göttinger Klassiker der Strömungsmechanik is thus making available selected publications that emerged from Ludwig Prandtl’s ‘Göttingen School’ or stand in a particular historical relationship to it. This highly personal biography of Ludwig Prandtl compiled by his daughter, Johanna Vogel-Prandtl, is complemented by numerous photographs depicting Prandtl’s working and private life. It completes the picture of the founding father of modern fluid mechanics whose scientific importance continues to resonate to this day.

GaN and its related compounds allow the fabrication of highly efficient light emitters and lasers ranging from red through yellow and green to blue in a single material. In this book the scientific basis of GaN light emitting devices and the physical concept and basic manufacturing technology of these new blue light emitting diodes and laser diodes are discussed. The breakthrough in GaN technology opens many new commercial applications for semiconductors, including displays, road and railway signalling, lighting, scanners, optical data storage, and much more. The new application field of power devices is also discussed. This second edition is not only updated but also significantly enlarged. The whole spectrum of GaN related materials, processing and application problems is contained, thus making this book the most comprehensive basic book in the field. It also tells the fascinating story of the extremely successful realization of Nakamura's research and development concept. The book will appeal to both researchers and engineers.

As startling as it sounds, modern physics suggests that within the next two decades, scientists may be able to perform this seemingly divine feat-- to concoct an entirely new baby universe, complete with its own physical laws, star systems, galaxies, and even intelligent life. To create your own cosmos, you would need a particle accelerator, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva or one of the proposed next-generation colliders, a lot of physics know-how, and a bit of luck. A Big Bang in a Little Room will take the reader on a journey through the history of cosmology and unravel-- particle-by-particle, theory-by-theory, and experiment-by-experiment-- the ideas behind this provocative claim made by some of the most-respected physicists alive today. Beyond simply explaining the science, A Big Bang in a Little Room will also tell the story of the people who have been plugging away for more than thirty years to make this seemingly impossible dream a reality, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos and our place in it as humans. A Big Bang in a Little Room will examine their extravagant plans, which include current and future space missions, accelerator runs, and table-top lab experiments to search for evidence supporting their ideas In the process, the book will ask deep philosophical questions about what it means for us, as humans, to begin to contemplate creating a new universe. Remarkable in its originality and ambition, A Big Bang in a Little Room is the ideal read for anyone seeking to understand the making of our universe-- as well as the others just waiting to be created""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It explores the fundamental issues pertaining to light that still exist today.    Gathering contributions from globally recognized specialists in electrodynamics and quantum optics, the book begins by clearly presenting the mainstream view of the nature of light and photons. It then provides a new and challenging scientific epistemology that explains how to overcome the prevailing paradoxes and confusions arising from the accepted definition of a photon as a monochromatic Fourier mode of the vacuum. The book concludes with an array of experiments that demonstrate the innovative thinking needed to examine the wave-particle duality of photons.     Looking at photons from both mainstream and out-of-box viewpoints, this volume is sure to inspire the next generation of quantum optics scientists and engineers to go beyond the Copenhagen interpretation and formulate new conceptual ideas about light-matter interactions and substantiate them through inventive applications.

The Lunar Domes Handbook is a reference work on these elusive features. It provides a collection of images for a large number of lunar domes, including telescopic images acquired with advanced but still moderately intricate amateur equipment as well as recent orbital spacecraft images. Different methods for determining the morphometric properties of lunar domes (diameter, height, flank slope, edifice volume) from image data or orbital topographic data are discussed. Additionally, multispectral and hyperspectral image data are examined, providing insights into the composition of the dome material. Several classification schemes for lunar domes are described, including an approach based on the determined morphometric quantities and spectral analyses. Furthermore, the book provides a description of geophysical models of lunar domes, which yield information about the properties of the lava from which they formed and the depth of the magma source regions below the lunar surface.

From a review of the first edition: ""The present volume is a welcome edition to the growing number of books that develop geometrical language and use it to describe new developments in particle physics...It provides clear treatment that is accessible to graduate students with a knowledge of advanced calculus and of classical physics...The second half of the book deals with the principles of differential geometry and its applications, with a mathematical machinery of very wide range. Here clear line drawings and illustrations supplement the multitude of mathematical definitions. This section, in its clarity and pedagogy, is reminiscent of Gravitation by Charles Misner, Kip Thorne and John Wheeler...Felsager gives a very clear presentation of the use of geometric methods in particle physics...For those who have resisted learning this new language, his book provides a very good introduction as well as physical motivation. The inclusion of numerous exercises, worked out, renders the book useful for independent study also. I hope this book will be followed by others from authors with equal flair to provide a readable excursion into the next step."" PHYSICS TODAY Bjoern Felsager is a high school teacher in Copenhagen.

These materials, called ""soft matter"" (""matière fragile"" in French), have neither the rigid structure and crystalline symmetry of a solid nor the uniformity and disorder of a fluid or a gas. They have unusual and fascinating properties: some change their viscosity at our beck and call; others form layers of two-dimensional liquids; some are polarized, their molecules all oriented in the same direction and turning in unison at our command; others make up the foams, bubbles, waxes, gums, and many other items we take for granted every day. De Gennes, one of the world's leading experts on these strange forms of matter, here addresses topics ranging from soft-matter physics - the formation of rubber, the nature and uses of gum arabic, the wetting and de-wetting of surfaces, and the mysterious properties of bubbles and foams - to the activities of science: the role of individual or team work, the relation of discovery to correction, and the interplay of conscience and knowledge.

Both theoretical and advanced experimental results are outlined. Considerations of d-, s-, or more complicated order parameter symmetry are discussed at length, serving as a benchmark for an overall view of the field as of April 1998. Many of the results presented are new and have neither appeared nor been discussed previously. Interesting experimental facts are given on junctions and fluctuations, both in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. Electronic, optical, magnetic and transport properties are discussed. The editors' concern for coherence and legibility means that the book can be read by anyone concerned with superconductivity. No other book focuses so closely on an understanding of symmetry and pairing in superconductors.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These hyperfine techniques provide unique tools to probe the structure and symmetry of commensurate CDWs, give a clear fingerprint of incommensurate CDWs, and are ideally suited for CDW dynamics. This book represents a new attempt in the series `Physics and Chemistry of Materials with Low-dimensional Structures' to bring together a consistent group of scientific results obtained by nuclear spectroscopy related to CDW phenomena in pseudo-one- and two-dimensional systems. The individual chapters contain: the theory of CDWs in chain-like transition metal tetrachalcogenides; NMR, NQR, TDPAC, and ME investigations of layered transition metal dichalcogenides; NMR studies of CDW-transport in chain-like NbSe3 and molybdenum bronzes; multinuclear NMR of KCP; high resolution NMR of organic conductors.

The philosophical analysis is based on the separation of syntax and semantics which is at the root of Kolmogorov's theory of probability; recursive functions and algorithmic complexity are used to discuss entropy and randomness. Basic concepts are discussed together with concrete physical models for phase transitions, scaling, renormalization semigroups, and the irreversible approach to equilibrium.

The dynamics of a single molecule, measured with the help of a train of photons emitted at random time moments, is a main subject of the book. The dynamics is calculated with the help of quantum-mechanical methods and equations for the density matrix of the system consisting of a single chromophore interacting with light, phonons and non-equilibrium tunneling systems of polymers and glasses. A dynamical theory for one- and two-photon counting methods used in single molecule spectroscopy is presented. Photon bunching and antibunching, jumps of optical lines, and quantum trajectories of various types are further topics addressed. This is the first book to present a detailed theoretical basis for single molecule spectroscopy. It also describes numerous experimental applications of the theory.

The main papers emerging from this meeting are collected in this volume. They deal with fundamental plasma phenomena, particle and radiation processes in astrophysics and space physics as the origin of magnetic activity, the basic mechanisms of particle acceleration and plasma heating common to plasma in galaxies and at the sun as well as in planetary magnetospheres. New observational results from YOHKOH, SOHO and other missions are presented. Using these, the basic physical processes leading to coronal heating and solar/stellar wind acceleration are discussed. Other topics are the microphysics of shock waves and transport phenomena in collisionless plasmas and the physics of thin plasma boundaries. The volume also treats the ionic composition of plasma and dust in the Universe and their observability in the solar system. A CD-ROM is attached which adds a valuable multimedia component, illuminating results of observations, theory and simulations. Everyone interested in astrophysical plasmas, its radiation and charged particle aspects, and advanced or even beginning students will find references to nearly all modern aspects of plasma astrophysics and space physics as well as an overview of current research results.

Written with today's students in mind, this text covers the core material required by an introductory course in a clear and refreshing way. A second colour is used throughout to enhance learning and understanding. Each topic is introduced from first principles so that the text is suitable for students without a prior background in physics. At the same time the book is designed to enable students to proceed easily to subsequent courses in physics and may be used to support such courses.    Mathematical methods (in particular, calculus and vector analysis) are introduced within the text as the need arises and are presented in the context of the physical problems which they are used to analyse. Particular aims of the book are to demonstrate to students that the easiest, most concise and least ambiguous way to express and describe phenomena in physics is by using the language of mathematics and that, at this level, the total amount of mathematics required is neither large nor particularly demanding.     'Modern physics' topics (relativity and quantum mechanics) are introduced at an earlier stage than is usually found in introductory textbooks and are integrated with the more 'classical' material from which they have evolved. This book encourages students to develop an intuition for relativistic and quantum concepts at as early a stage as is practicable.    The text takes a reflective approach towards the scientific method at all stages and, in keeping with the title of the text, emphasis is placed on understanding of, and insight into, the material presented""--  ""Understanding Physics -- Second edition is a comprehensive, yet compact, introductory physics textbook aimed at physics undergraduates and also at engineers and other scientists taking a general physics course""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Even physicists have occasion to marvel at the overarching reach of basic principles and their ability to account for features stretching from the microscopic sub-atomic world to the cosmological expanses of the Universe. While mathematics is its natural language, physics is mostly about patterns, connections, and relations between objects and phenomena, and it is this aspect that is emphasized in this book. Since science tries to connect phenomena that at first sight appear widely different, while boiling them down to a small set of essential principles and laws, metaphor and analogy pervade our subject. Consider the pendulum, its swing from one extreme to the other often invoked in social or economic contexts. In molecular vibrations, such as in the CO2 molecule, the quantum motions of electrons and nuclei are metaphorically the pendulums. In electromagnetic radiation, including the visible light we observe, there are not even any concrete material particles, only electric and magnetic fields executing simple harmonic motion. But, to a physicist, they are all ""just a pendulum"". The selection of topics reflects the author's own four-decade career in research physics and his resultant perspective on the subject. While aimed primarily at physicists, including junior students, this book also addresses other readers who are willing to think with symbols and simple algebra in understanding the physical world around us. Each chapter, on themes such as dimensions, transformations, symmetries, or maps, begins with simple examples accessible to all while connecting them later to more sophisticated realizations in more advanced topics of physics."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The various chapters present the basic physics behind the simulation programs, their structure and many applications to different topics. The two main streams, the binary collision model and the classical dynamics model, are discussed, as are interaction potentials and electronic energy losses. The main topics investigated are backscattering, sputtering and implantation for incident atomic particles with energies from the eV to the MeV range. An extensive overview of the literature is given, making this book of interest to the active reseacher as well to students entering the field.

These systems range from nanostructures to biomolecules. These methods rely on the use of localized basis sets, which are optimised for the representation of occupied Kohn-Sham states but do not guarantee an accurate representation of the unoccupied states.  This is problematic if one wishes to combine the power of LS-DFT with that of theoretical spectroscopy, which provides a direct link between simulation and experiment.  In this work a new method is presented for optimizing localized functions to accurately represent the unoccupied states, thus allowing theoretical spectroscopy of large systems. Results are presented for optical absorption spectra calculated using the ONETEP code, but the method is equally applicable to other spectroscopies and LS formulations. Other topics covered include a study of some simple one dimensional basis sets and the presentation of two methods for band structure calculation using localized basis sets, both of which have important implications for the use of localized basis sets within LS-DFT.

Besides, the employment of probabilistic representations together with the Monte Carlo technique allows us to reduce solution of multi-dimensional problems for partial differential equations to integration of stochastic equations. This approach leads to powerful computational mathematics that is presented in the treatise. The authors propose many new special schemes, some published here for the first time. In the second part of the book they construct numerical methods for solving complicated problems for partial differential equations occurring in practical applications, both linear and nonlinear. All the methods are presented with proofs and hence founded on rigorous reasoning, thus giving the book textbook potential. An overwhelming majority of the methods are accompanied by the corresponding numerical algorithms which are ready for implementation in practice. The book addresses researchers and graduate students in numerical analysis, physics, chemistry, and engineering as well as mathematical biology and financial mathematics.

The focus of this book is on the contribution made by the ordering of bond orientations (as distinguished from the orientations of the molecules themselves) on the behavior of condensed systems, particularly their phase transitions. Examples in which bond-orientational effects play an important role are liquid crystals, quasicrystals, and two-dimensional crystals. This book contains contributions by many of the foremost researchers in the field. The chapters are tutorial reviews of the subject, written both for the active researcher looking for a review of a topic and for the graduate student investigating an exciting area of research. The contributions include an overview by J.D. Brock, Cornell; a discussion of computer simulation studies by K.J. Strandburg, Argonne; chapters on phase transition in hexatic liquid crystals by C.C. Huang, Minnesota and C.A. Murray, Texas A & M; and chapters on quasicrystals by S. Sachdev, Yale, M.V. Jaric, A.I. Goldman, Iowa State, and T.-L. Ho, Ohio State.

The Ahnenerbe was the brainchild of Himmler, the Reichsfuhrer SS and architect of the Final Solution, who was intensely interested in Germany’s ancient past. His intent was not only to rewrite the history of what he and others termed the “Aryan Race,” but also to use that mythic past to shape a more glorious future for Germany. While attempting to prove that Aryans were responsible for all of civilization’s greatest achievements, he also hoped to use tall, blond-haired SS men as stock to breed future generations of Germans in a racially purer mold. In the tradition of Hitler’s Willing Executioners, THE MASTER PLAN is also an expose of the work of German scientists and scholars who allowed their research to be used to justify extermination, and who, in some cases, directly participated in the slaughter—many of whom resumed their academic positions at war’s end. Intensely compelling and exhaustively researched, THE MASTER PLAN is based on extensive personal interviews and previously ignored archival material.

Fault accommodation (FA) is one ofeffective methods that can be used to enhance system stability and reliability, so ithas been widely and in-depth investigated and become a hot topic in recent years.Fault detection is used to monitor whether a fault occurs, which is the first step inFA. On the basis of fault detection, fault estimation (FE) is utilized to determineonline the magnitude of the fault, which is a very important step because the additionalcontroller is designed using the fault estimate. Compared with fault detection,the design difficulties of FE would increase a lot, so research on FE and accommodationis very challenging. Although there have been advancements reported on FEand accommodation for dynamic systems, the common methods at the present stagehave design difficulties, which limit applications of respective design approaches.Therefore, the problems of FE and accommodation are needed to be further studied.This book considers the theory and technology of FE and accommodation fordynamic systems, and establishes a systemic and comprehensive framework of FEand accommodation for continuous/discrete-time systems.

The work of Stephen Wolfram over the last several decades has been a salient part in this phenomenon helping founding the field of Complex Systems, with many of his constructs and ideas incorporated in his book A New Kind of Science (ANKS) becoming part of the scientific discourse and general academic knowledge--from the now established Elementary Cellular Automata to the unconventional concept of mining the Computational Universe, from today's widespread Wolfram's Behavioural Classification to his principles of Irreducibility and Computational Equivalence.This volume, with a Foreword by Gregory Chaitin and an Afterword by Cris Calude, covers these and other topics related to or motivated by Wolfram's seminal ideas, reporting on research undertaken in the decade following the publication of Wolfram's NKS book. Featuring 39 authors, its 23 contributions are organized into seven parts: Mechanisms in Programs & NatureSystems Based on Numbers & Simple Programs Social and Biological Systems & Technology Fundamental PhysicsThe Behavior of Systems & the Notion of ComputationIrreducibility & Computational EquivalenceReflections and Philosophical Implications.

When quantum mechanics was discovered in 1925, paving the way for modern molecular physics, this subject was less well received by the chemists. Partly this was due to the morass of equations and calculations one sinks into, just to get insight into such a simple concept as the chemical bond. Application of quantum methods in chemistry was pioneered by people like Henry Eyring, Linus Pauling, Robert Mulliken, Per-Olov Löwdin, Björn Roos, and many others. Most of these scientists called themselves ""quantum chemists"". The calculation of electronic energies and wave functions made impressive progress during the second half of the twentieth century, a development that ran parallel to the improvement of computer technology. At the same time the new subject of Quantum Chemistry became standardized and automatized. There is now an army of users of ready programs, who calculate bond lengths and reaction barriers with ever increasing accuracy. Unfortunately there appears to be some hesitation to tackle more difficult problems, such as transfer of protons, electrons, and excitations. These fields were pioneered by, for example, Rudy Marcus, Norman Sutin, Noel Hush, Joshua Jortner, John R. Miller, and Ahmed Zewail. It has become customary to refer to physics and chemistry based on the quantum mechanical behavior of the elementary particles, atoms and molecules, as Chemical Physics, and this explains the main title of this book""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Quantum non-locality and relativity,Tim Maudlin,physics,First published in 2011,/works/OL15979949W,/authors/OL716764A/Tim_Maudlin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24885030M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Wiley-Blackwell|Language English|Pages 298,"""Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity is recognized as the premier philosophical study of Bell's Theorem and its implication for the relativistic account of space and time. Previous editions have been praised for the remarkable clarity of Maudlin's descriptions of both Bell's theorem and his examination of the potential conflict between the theorem and relativity. The third edition of this text has been carefully updated to reflect significant developments, including a new chapter covering important recent work in the foundations of physics. Foremost among these is Roderich Tumiulka's explicit, relativistic theory that can reproduce the quantum mechanical violation of Bell's inequality. The ""Free Will Theorem"" of John Conway and Simon Kochen is also discussed, as is the status of locality in the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum theory. The book has also been updated to reflect recent results in information theory. The book introduces philosophers to the relevant physics and demonstrates how philosophical analysis can help to resolve some of the problems, and requires no technical background in Physics. All of the physics is presented from first principles, and as much as possible is presented pictorially""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why does e=mc2,Brian Cox,physics,First published in 2009,/works/OL13766704W?edition=ia%3Awhydoesemcandwhy00coxb,/authors/OL1345320A/Brian_Cox,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23175425M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Da Capo Press|Language English,"The most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today's leading scientists. Professor Brian Cox and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up Einstein's most famous equation, E=mc2. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is mass? What has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? In answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine—which can recreate conditions in the early Universe fractions of a second after the Big Bang—Cox and Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass. Alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? Answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. In other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed. A collaboration between two of the youngest professors in the UK, Why Does E=mc2? promises to be one of the most exciting and accessible explanations of the theory of relativity in recent years.

These features will distinguish this continuum mechanics book from other books on this subject. Textbooks on continuum mechanics are widely employed in engineering education, however, none of them deal specifically with anisotropy in materials. For the audience of Biomedical, Chemical and Civil Engineering students, these materials will be dealt with more frequently and greater accuracy in their analysis will be desired. Continuum Mechanics of Anisotropic Materials' author has been a leader in the field of developing new approaches for the understanding of anisotropic materials.

Many people know the tides are caused by the pull of the Moon and to a lesser extent the Sun. But very few can explain exactly how and why that happens. Fewer still can calculate the  actual pulls of the Moon and Sun on the oceans. This book shows in clear detail how to do this with simple tools. It uniquely crosses disciplines – history, astronomy, physics and mathematics – and takes pains to explain things frequently passed over or taken for granted in other books. Using a problem-based approach, “Newton’s Gravity” explores the surprisingly basic mathematics behind gravity, the most fundamental force that governs the movements of satellites, planets, and the stars.

Is it relevant whether the human observer is himself a part of the system in question? What difference does this make to our representation of the physical world? These difficult questions have occupied scientists and philosophers from Decartes to Bell. In the light of recent advances in quantum mechanics and the theory of dynamical systems, there is good reason to tackle these problems afresh.

The latest experiments on long-time spectral diffusion and heat release, electric field and strain effects, quantum tunneling on light atoms like H and D, as well as non-equilibrium phenomena are thoroughly discussed in terms of the interaction with and between tunneling systems. Several outstanding theoretical contributions provide an overview of the most original ideas and theoretical methods used to understand the nature and dynamics of tunneling systems in solids and their interactions. The book introduces the non-expert reader to the phenomenological standard tunneling model and its further development, the soft potential model. The chapters of the book give full descriptions of the experimental and theoretical methods of the relevant experiments and models in the fascinating field of the physics of glasses and disordered solids.

Thermodynamic Basis of Crystal Growth,Jacob H.

Consequently, new and more sensitive methods must be developed to probe the non-stoichiometry. For many types of materials vapor pressure scanning can be such a technique. This method was developed by the author, and it is a way of determining the composition of the solid, X, at the measured temperature, T, and pressure, P, with an unparalleled accuracy of up to 10-4 at.% at high temperatures (up to 1200° C). Along with the results obtained by the author and his colleagues, P-T-X diagrams of other important materials (e.g. III-V, IV-VI semiconductors) are also discussed. The exposition is in two parts. In the first one a geometrical thermodynamic approach is used for a step-by-step presentation of P-T-X diagrams of binary systems. The types of diagrams most frequently encountered in materials science are discussed. The composition of crystals grown from various matrices is presented in conjunction with the P-T-X diagrams. In the second part examples of systems which have been recently experimentally studied are given. Throughout the book emphasis is placed on the Phase Rule argument of universal solubility. This is where this book differs from the other (quite scarce) texts on P-T-X phase diagrams. This book will be of interest to the wide community of materials scientists, and to university lecturers and their students.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This unified approach makes the material easily accessible to non-specialists and provides an easy access to practical applications. Written for graduate students, the book presents a wealth of useful examples; in particular, models of unstable and N-level systems are treated systematically and in considerable detail including new types of generated Bloch-equations. The general theory is extensively summarized from abstract dynamical maps to those obtained by a reduction of Hamiltonian dynamics under a Markovian approximation. Various methods of determining semigroup generators and the corresponding master equations are discussed including time-dependent and nonlinear generators. Further topics treated are a generalized H-theorem, quantum detailed balance and return to equilibrium, discrete quantum Boltzmann equation, nonlinear Schro dinger equation, spin relaxation by spin waves, entropy production and its generalization by a measure of irreversibiblity.

Esta fama, en mi opinión, es solamente justificada hasta cierto punto. La teoría de la relatividad especial forma parte del currículum estándar de cualquier estudiante de física en los primeros años de la carrera. La relatividad general es más difícil y la suelen estudiar sólo los estudiantes especializándose en física teórica. Sin embargo, conviene distinguir dos partes dentro de la relatividad general: una parte física, que describe las ideas básicas de la teoría, y una parte matemática, que nos da el formalismo con el cual describir la física.  En este curso he intentado mantener el equilibrio entre estas dos partes, puesto que creo que las dos son igual de importantes: sin la matemática es imposible alcanzar un nivel que vaya más allá de los numerosos libros de popularización sobre relatividad. Por otro lado, sin la parte física uno estaría haciendo básicamente geometría diferencial a un nivel que lo podía haber hecho Riemann en el siglo XIX y se perdería unos profundos principios sobre la equivalencia de observadores y la estructura del espacio y el tiempo.  La teoría de la relatividad es, junto con la mecánica cuántica, uno de los dos pilares de la física del siglo XX. Cualquier teoría que pretenda ser fundamental debería tomar en cuenta estos dos pilares.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Transient Effects in Friction,Andreas Goedecke,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19907751W?edition=ia%3Atransienteffects00goed,/authors/OL7357280A/Andreas_Goedecke,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27092701M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Vienna,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 197","Transient friction effects determine the behavior of a wide class of mechatronic systems. Classic examples are squealing brakes, stiction in robotic arms, or stick-slip in linear drives. To properly design and understand mechatronic systems of this type, good quantitative models of transient friction effects are of primary interest. The theory developed in this book approaches this problem bottom-up, by deriving the behavior of macroscopic friction surfaces from the microscopic surface physics. The model is based on two assumptions: First, rough surfaces are inherently fractal, exhibiting roughness on a wide range of scales. Second, transient friction effects are caused by creep enlargement of the real area of contact between two bodies. This work demonstrates the results of extensive Finite Element analyses of the creep behavior of surface asperities, and proposes a generalized multi-scale area iteration for calculating the time-dependent real contact between two bodies. The toolset is then demonstrated both for the reproduction of a variety of experimental results on transient friction as well as for system simulations of two example systems.

Flash Floods,Kevin Sene,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19850372W?edition=ia%3Aflashfloodsforec00sene,/authors/OL6601130A/Kevin_Sene,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27039049M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Netherlands,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 385","The book describes flash floods - one of the most devastating of natural hazards, which develop in a period of minutes to a few hours. Floods of this type are often characterised by fast flowing deep water and a high debris content which - combined with the short lead time available for warnings - add to the risk to people and property. The main cause of flash flooding is usually heavy rainfall; other causes can include the break- up of ice jams, dam breaches, and the failure of flood defenses and levees.The volume discusses the increasing use of meteorological observation and forecasting techniques to extend the lead time available for warning, combined with hydrological models for the river response. It also presents probabilistic techniques and some current areas of research which include the use of weather radar and satellite data in improving meteorological forecasts, the development of improved forecasting and observation techniques for mountainous regions, and the use of distributed hydrological models specifically adapted for flash flood modelling.This book reviews recent developments in this active research area, with a focus on events caused by heavy rainfall (including debris flows and landslides), but also considering other types of flash flooding, such as that caused by ice jams and dam and levee breaches. The topics covered include meteorological forecasting and monitoring techniques, rainfall-runoff and river modelling, approaches to issuing flood warnings, and some of the societal and behavioural aspects of providing an effective emergency response. A number of international examples of the application of these techniques are also provided.The book is potentially useful on civil engineering, water resources, meteorology and hydrology courses (and for post graduate studies) but is primarily intended as a review of the topic for a wider audience.

Since then it has been deleted.  It is about how certain postures and slow deep breathing in sitting, standing, etc. leads to great strength without artificial exercise.  The author based his theory on observations of ""natural strongmen"".  Bodybuilders lost size and strength while away from the gym, but these natural strongmen did not.  Unfortunately, the author's theory completely ignores the genetic basis of physical variation in humans and other animals.  You cannot make a rottweiler out of a poodle.  Bill Maxwell, Ottawa.

One of the most important and interesting issues, and the subject of this volume, is the clarification of the microscopic origin and mechanism of high temperature superconductivity. This book discusses the latest experimental results on magnetic, optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of the Cu-O and Bi-O superconductors, as well as proposed theoretical models of the mechanisms. The participants in the symposium agreed that for the high Tc Cu-O superconductors electron correlation effects are of central importance. For the Bi-O superconductors the main topic was whether the mechanism of superconductivity is the same as that of high Tc Cu-O superconductors. What was and what was not resolved at the symposium is summarized at the end of the volume.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Thus an eight meter class telescope, such as one of the four in the Very Large Telescope operated by ESO in Chile, will in future be routinely capable of an angular resolution of almost 0.01 arcsec, compared tot he present resolution of about 0.5 arcsec for conventional imaging in good condition. All the world's major telescopes either have adaptive optics or are in the process of building AO systems. It turns out that a reasonable fraction of the sky can be observed using adaptive optics, with moderately good imaging quality, provided imaging in done in the near IR. To move out of the near IR, with its relatively poor angular resolution, astronomers need a laser guide star. There is a layer of Na atoms at approximately 90 km altitude that can be excited by a laser to produce such a source, or Rayleigh scattering can be employed lower in the atmosphere. But the production and use of laser guide stars is not trivial, and the key issues determining their successful implementation are discussed here, including the physics of the Na atom, the cone effect, tilt determination, sky coverage, and numerous potential astronomical applications.

Preference is given to discussing the assumptions made in developing theories and analyzing experimental data rather than to attempting to compile all the latest results. The book has four parts. Part I is quite descriptive in character and gives a general overview of the various liquid crystalline phases. Part II deals with the macroscopic continuum theory of liquid crystals and gives a systematic development of the theory from a tensorial point of view thus emphasizing the relevant symmetries. Part III concentrates on experiments that provide microscopic information on the orientational behaviour of the molecules. Finally Part IV discusses the theory of the various phases and their attendant phase transitions from both a Landau and a molecular-statistical point of view. Simplifying the various models as far as possible, it critically examines the merits of a molecular-statistical approach.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In contrast to the classical approach, the local equilibrium hypothesis is abandoned. The basic variables describing the system are no longer the equilibrium conserved variables: the latter are complemented by non-equilibrium quantities, such as the heat flux, the viscous pressure tensor, the matter flux, the electric current flux, etc. The claims made for extended thermodynamics are confirmed by the kinetic theory of gases and statistical mechanics. The book covers a wide spectrum of applications such as hyperbolic heat conduction, rheological models, waves in fluids, generalized hydrodynamics, phase diagrams of solutions under shear, non-Fickian diffusion, electrical systems, and a relativistic formulation including some cosmological applications. The book also contains a wide discussion of the foundations and the scope of the current theories on non-equilibrium thermodynamics (classical irreversible thermodynamics and rational thermodynamics). The present edition reflects new developments in the theory and applications, adds new problems and provides a more detailed comparison with other fields of active research. It contains one hundred thirty proposed problems, whose detailed solutions, as well as wide bibliography on extended irreversible thermodynamics and related topics,may be unloaded from the www.uab.es/dep-fisica/eit website.

"Kerne, Kooperation und Konkurrenz",Silke Fengler,physics,First published in 2014,/works/OL20932891W,/authors/OL8012661A/Silke_Fengler,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Böhlau|Pages 378,"At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, a new sub-field of physics and chemistry emerged centering on radioactivity. Its disciplinary structures were slow to crystallize. The early phase of this field was characterized by substantial international exchange between the European centers in Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Cambridge and a concomitant high degree of transdisciplinarity. Research on radioactivity was also marked by an unusual openness in respect to gender and gender politics. The volatile political and social context of nuclear research, which abruptly changed several times, acted to further, impede or block these initiatives to transcend diverse boundaries in science, politics, and society. The two central questions of the present project are: How did the agendas and foci of Austrian nuclear research, and the styles of work of the scientists, change within the framework of international cooperation and competition? How were these developments dynamically linked with the political, social and cultural shifts in European history in the 20th century?     The historical analysis starts with the founding of the Vienna Institute for Radium Research (IRR), including the institutes for physics at the University of Vienna that worked in close cooperation with the IRR.  The period under investigation extends from the late years of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire to World War I, the era of ""Red Vienna,"" the ""state of estates"" (Ständestaat) and the Nazi dictatorship, down to the full restoration of Austrian sovereignty in 1955.  The study will include systematic transnational comparisons with the other centers of European nuclear research, based in part on existing literature from the history of science, as well as exact reconstructions of the bilateral and multilateral cooperative links and relations with the international scientific community. In this way, the proposed project is expected to go beyond the historical reconstruction of nuclear research in Austria and shed light on the importance of nationality and internationality, both for framing politics and as mental and cultural points of reference for the behavior and actions of the scientific actors and the production of scientific knowledge under shifting constellations of war and peace, democracy and dictatorship.  Wie veränderte sich die Radioaktivitäts- und Kernforschung in Österreich seit der Entdeckung des Kernzerfalls im späten 19. Jahrhundert bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges? Dieses Buch bietet eine profunde Analyse lokaler Forschungstraditionen im politisch-sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Kontext. Die Studie verortet das Institut für Radiumforschung in Wien und andere österreichische Standorte der Radioaktivitäts- bzw. Kernforschung in zwei sich überlagernden Netzwerken: Einerseits im regionalen Forschungsraum der Habsburger Monarchie, der Ersten Republik und des „Dritten Reiches“ und andererseits in der globalen Gemeinschaft der „Radioaktivisten“. Sie zeigt anhand neuer Archivquellen, welche Rolle die in Österreich vorhandenen Ressourcen im globalen Netzwerk der Kernforschung spielten.

GHM describes plasma interactions that combine the effects of gravity and a strong magnetic field, in the vicinity (ergosphere) of a rapidly rotating black hole. This topic was created in response to the astrophysical quest to understand the central engines of radio loud extragalactic radio sources. The theory describes a ""torsional tug of war"" between rotating ergospheric plasma and the distant asymptotic plasma that extracts the rotational inertia of the black hole. The recoil from the struggle between electromagnetic and gravitational forces near the event horizon is manifested as a powerful pair of magnetized particle beams (jets) that are ejected at nearly the speed of light. These bipolar jets feed large-scale magnetized plasmoids on scales as large as millions of light years (the radio lobes of extragalactic radio sources). This interaction can initiate jets that transport energy fluxes exceeding 10*47 ergs/s.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sister Kenny: The Woman Who Challenged the Doctors,Victor Cohn,physics,First published in 1975,/works/OL4485296W?edition=ia%3Asisterkennywoman0000cohn,/authors/OL895197A/Victor_Cohn,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL5193935M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1975|Publisher  University of Minnesota Press|Language English|Pages 302,"On April 14, 1940, a woman named Elizabeth Kenny stepped onto a pier in San Francisco. An independent-minded bush nurse from Australia, she was determined to shake up the doctors. She wanted to make them reverse their surely wrongheaded treatment of one of the most dreaded diseases of all time: poliomyelitis. She wanted to show that their ""paralyzed"" children could walk. It was late in her life. She had lost her battle in her own country. On some days her legs ached and on some her hope sagged. She was a crusader, however. At the age of 59, half sick at heart yet stubborn as youth, she had sailed to America to try again. Within 5 years, she succeeded. She relived the classic story of Upstart versus Authority and reminded the world that the learned establishment is not always right. Elizabeth Kenny's one-woman revolution helped start modern medical rehabilitation. She taught doctors to substitute optimistic activity for the immobilization of polio victims in plaster casts for weeks and months, one of the most painful and harmful treatments ever practiced. By this achievement, she prevented a vast amount of crippling in the years before the Salk and Sabin vaccines. Even more important, she helped turn medicine toward a new aggressive approach to all injury. - Introduction.  Sister Elizabeth Kenny, the Australian-born nurse, is remembered by thousands of grateful parents and grandparents of young polio patients, as well as others who were less personally affected, as the woman who successfully fought the medical profession to win acceptance of her techniques to combat the crippling effects of this disease. In this biography Victor Cohn, a prize-winning science writer, details the life of Sister Kenny and her significant role in the history of medicine. It is an inspiring story and one which will be of particular interest to those of the present generation who are engaged in the movement for women's equality. Sister Kenny's struggle against the bitter opposition of many doctors to her concepts for the treatment of polio dramatized the then common attitude of male chauvinism on the part of the medical profession toward nurses. The biography traces Sister Kenny's life from her birth in Australia, through her early nursing career in the bush, to her rise to prominence in America. Much of the narrative focuses on her confrontation with the medical establishment. Throughout, the author writes from an objective viewpoint, and in conclusion he assesses Sister Kenny's accomplishments. - Publisher.

Sixty-two out of 84 randomized, volunteer female nurses completed all assessments in the study. Ages ranged from 25-56 years. All were required to sign an informed consent and were told they could stop any assessment at any time. No nurse expressed any major discomfort at any time during the physical testing. Height, weight, resting blood pressure, resting pulse rate and grip strength were measured in the initial session and subjects were given a packet of assessments to fill out and return at session two. Session two was composed of the subjects returning their packets, taking the Simmons Personal Inventory, the sit and reach test and the Rockport Walking Test. Time and ending heart rate for the walking test was taken and recorded by the principle investigator.  Data from the study indicated that physical measures could predict work performance, trait anxiety, hardiness and work-related characteristics only minimally. Specifically, elevated blood cholesterol levels were associated with an increase in trait anxiety scores and higher body mass index was correlated with higher performance ratings.

This book is about the advancement of ideas on the stochastic nature of space-time from the 1930s onward. In particular, the author promotes the concept of space as a set of hazy lumps, first introduced by Karl Menger, and constructs a novel framework for statistical behaviour at the microlevel. The various chapters address topics such as space-time fluctuation and random potential, non-local fields, and the origin of stochasticity. Implications in astro-particle physics and cosmology are also explored. Audience: This volume will be of interest to physicists, chemists and mathematicians involved in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of highly sensitive visual responses and other photosensitive responses of biological systems, and the very efficient transduction of photoenergy to chemical energy in photosynthesis, it is important to observe molecular processes in biological systems. Using highly developed laser spectroscopic techniques, great progress has recently been achieved in the area of various primary processes in photobiology. It was therefore an excellent time to hold the 12th Taniguchi International Symposium, Biophysics Division, on Primary Processes in Photobiology. This volume is the proceedings of that symposium. Among the topics discussed are the femtosecond molecular processes in photosynthetic bacteriochlorophyll and the recently discovered intermediates in the photocycles of rhodopsin (found in the visual pigments of many animals), bacteriorhodopsin (found in the proton-pumping pigments of halobacteria) and retinochrome. New techniques for the measurement of the primary processes are also reported.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

FCS is based on the detection of single molecules excited to fluorescence in diffraction limited confocal volume elements and the time correlation of stochastic events. It provides ultimate sensitivity in the analysis of molecular processes and has found numerous applications in physics, chemistry and particularly in biomolecular sciences. Its high spatial and temporal resolution has made FCS a powerful tool for the analysis of molecular interactions and kinetics, transport properties due to thermal motion and flow, as well as the physics of the excited state in solution as well as at the cellular level. Its application in high throughput drug screening is using all the potential of this prime analytical tool.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Starting from general Delone sets the authors turn to di erent symmetry and topological classi- cations including explicit construction of orbifolds for two- and three-dimensional point and space groups.  Voronoï and Delone cells together with positive quadratic forms and lattice description by root systems are introduced to demonstrate alternative approaches to lattice geometry study.

It is now possible to isolate atomic systems in traps, measure in coincidence the fragments of collision processes, and by the use of storage rings produce and study multicharged ions; one can look at bulk matter in such a way that the fundamental atomic character is clearly evident, and work has begun to tease out the properties of antimatter. The papers in this book correspond to the invited talks at a conference dedicated to the study of all aspects of modern atomic physics. The meeting was designed both as a way of taking stock of what has been achieved and, it was hoped, as a means of stimulating new research, in new areas, along new lines. Consequently, an effort was made to touch on as many directions as possible. Amongst the topics included were: Coincidence studies of atomic collisions, hollow atom, clusters, atom traps, Bose-Einstein condensates, atomic interferometry, density functional theory, atomic physics with anti-matter and surface adsorbates. The papers in this book covered a wide range of topics in modern atomic physics. These topics were chosen to reflect some of the main new directions in research. An effort was made to identify novel approaches and areas of study which hold out the maximal potential for further developments.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Such local effects, as, for example, plastic deformation, yielding, strain-hardening, strain-softening, mechanical damage, matrix microcracking, aggregate debonding, fibre bridging, fibre slippage, crazing, and so on, are properly described through different simplified models, representing the peculiarities of the phenomena involved. The models are introduced and described separately and then compared in the last part of the book.

These methods combine higher-order accuracy in smooth regions, with sharp, oscillation-free representation of embedded shocks, and are now known as ""high-resolution schemes"". This volume collects in one place many of the most significant papers in the development of high-resolution schemes as occurred at ICASE, together with introductions from the editors, written from the modern vantage point. Chapter I covers the early development of approximate Riemann solvers in the context of monotonic schemes. Chapter II continues with papers dealing with second-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) schemes. Chapter III presents papers which show the historical development of total-variation-bounded (TVB) schemes at ICASE. Finally, Chapter IV collects papers on inherently multidimensional schemes, which preserve the attractive features of their one-dimensional predecessors.

The treatment shows the underlying connections between topics as diverse as critical phenomena in colloidal dynamics, glassy state relaxation and deformation, reinforced polymer composites, molecular level mixing in nanocomposites, and rough surfaces and interfaces. At the same time, each chapter is designed to be as independent as possible from the others so that the book can serve as a reference work as well as a text. It is not designed to review all the recent work in mesoscopic physics, which spans many disciplines. Rather, it attempts to establish a general framework for understanding and developing new materials that cannot be designed by the trial and error methods. Molecular dynamics is most suitable for the purpose of describing the dissipative and irreversible behavior of complex materials. The book introduces readers to the methods of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics as applied to complex materials, but always connects theories with experiments. A familiarity with the basics of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics is assumed. The book will be useful as a reference for researchers in academia and industry in the fields of condensed matter physics, polymer physics, colloid and interface science, material science and engineering; it will also appeal to graduate students in these fields.

This book provides an introduction to the key concepts used in processing quantum information and reveals that quantum mechanics is a generalisation of classical probability theory. After a gentle introduction to the necessary mathematics the authors describe the geometry of quantum state spaces. Focusing on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, they discuss the statistical distance measures and entropies used in quantum theory. The final part of the book is devoted to quantum entanglement - a non-intuitive phenomenon discovered by Schrˆdinger, which has become a key resource for quantum computation. This richly-illustrated book is useful to a broad audience of graduates and researchers interested in quantum information theory. Exercises follow each chapter, with hints and answers supplied.

The goal is axiomatization of these theories, building models of elementary particles and of their interactions with each other. The main obtained results are: the model of bead lightning; an explanation of redshift of the spectra of galaxies; the derivation of the Newton law in the concept of gravitons; the calculation of nuclear forces and the structure of simplest nuclei with the help of the theory of strong gravitation; building the model of weak interactions of elementary particles; presentation of quarks as a particular type of quasiparticles; explanation of the electron spin.

The applications include several areas of condensed matter physics and include also a chapter on thermochemistry. Phase transitions and critical phenomena are treated according to the modern development of the field, based on the ideas of universality and on the Widom scaling theory. For each topic, a mean-field or Landau theory is presented to describe qualitatively the phase transitions.  These theories include the van der Waals theory of the liquid-vapor transition, the Hildebrand-Heitler theory of regular mixtures, the Griffiths-Landau theory for multicritical points in multicomponent systems, the Bragg-Williams theory of order-disorder in alloys, the Weiss theory of ferromagnetism, the Néel theory of antiferromagnetism, the Devonshire theory for ferroelectrics and Landau-de Gennes theory of liquid crystals. This textbook is intended for students in physics and chemistry and provides a unique combination of thorough theoretical explanation and presentation of applications in both areas. Chapter summaries, highlighted essentials and problems with solutions enable a self sustained approach and deepen the knowledge.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We also demonstrate the inter-connection between these areas of nonlinear optics.  Nonlinear optical properties of media such as optical limiting can be applied in various areas of science and technology. To define suitable materials for these applications, one has to carefully analyse the nonlinear optical characteristics of various media, such as the nonlinear refractive indices, coefficients of nonlinear absorption, saturation absorption intensities, etc. Knowing the nonlinear optical parameters of materials is also important for describing the propagation effects, self-interaction of intense laser pulses, and optimisation of various nonlinear optical processes. Among those processes one can admit the importance of the studies of the frequency conversion of coherent laser sources. The area of interest for nonlinear optical characterization of materials is also closely related with new field of nanostructures formation and application during laser-matter interaction.We show how the nonlinear optical analysis of materials leads to improvement of their high-order nonlinear optical response during the interaction with strong laser fields. Ablation-induced nanoparticles formation is correlated with their applications as efficient sources of coherent short-wavelength photons. From other side, recent achievements of harmonic generation in plasmas are closely related with the knowledge of the properties of materials in the laser plumes. All of these studies are concerned with the low-order nonlinear optical features of various materials. The novelty of the approach developed in present book is related with inter-connection of those studies with each other.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It presents a balanced treatment of the theoretical and practical issues, including very recent results - some of which are published here for the first time. The topics covered in detail are: - image matching and optical flow computation - structure from stereo - structure from motion - motion estimation - integration of multiple views - motion modeling and prediction Aspects such as uniqueness of the solution, degeneracy conditions, error analysis, stability, optimality, and robustness are also investigated. These details together with the fact that the algorithms are accessible without necessarily studying the rest of the material, make this book particularly attractive to practitioners.

Cosmic Universe and Human History, microcosm and macrocosm, inorganic and living matter coexist and form a unique unity manifested in multiple forms. The Physical and the Mental constitute the form and the content of the World.  The world does not consist of subjects and objects, the “subject” and the “object” are metaphysical abstractions of the single and indivisible Wholeness. Man’s finite knowledge separates the Whole into parts and studies fragmentarily the beings. The Wholeness is manifested in multiple forms and each form encapsulates the Wholeness. The rational explanation of the excerpts and the intuitive apprehension of the Wholeness are required to combine and create the open thought and the holistic knowledge. This means that the measurement should be defined by the ''measure'', but the responsibility for determining the ''measure'' depends on the man. This requires that man overcomes the anthropocentric arrogance and the narcissistic selfishness and he joins the Cosmic World in a friendly and creative manner.

The author unifies observations and theory which gives a wide perspective to the subject. An important feature is the lucidly written presentation of the fundamentals of plasma physics. The basic theory developed is then extended to some exemplary and important observations of coronal dynamics, such as coronal current, particle acceleration, propagation of particle beams, and shocks. The book has grown from the author's introductory courses on plasma astrophysics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technnology (ETH). it addressed advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate students without a background in plasma physics. It will also be of interest to more senior research workers involved in coronal physics, solar/stellar winds, and various other fields of plasma astrophysics.

This book introduces these sophisticated methods in a straightforward manner. The methods are applied to several important phenomena of solid state physics which impinge on fracture mechanics: adhesion, defect nucleation and growth, dislocation emission, sintering, the electron beam effect and fractal cracks. The book shows how the mathematical models for such processes may be set up, and how the equations so formulated may be solved and interpreted. The many open problems which are encountered will provide topics for MSc and PhD theses in fracture mechanics, and in theoretical and experimental physics. As a supplementary text, the book can be used in graduate level courses on fracture mechanics, solid matter physics, and mechanics of solids, or in a special course on the application of fracture mechanics methods in solid matter physics.

This is accomplished through the development of an exact path integral for use in transferring information from observations to a model of the observed system. Through many illustrative examples drawn from models in neuroscience, fluid dynamics, geosciences, and nonlinear electrical circuits, the concepts are exemplified in detail. Practical numerical methods for approximate evaluations of the path integral are explored, and their use in designing experiments and determining a model's consistency with observations is investigated. Using highly instructive examples, the problems of data assimilation and the means to treat them are clearly illustrated. This book will be useful for students and practitioners of physics, neuroscience, regulatory networks, meteorology and climate science, network dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other systematic investigations of complex systems.

Nothing at first sight. Yet the distance scales, the energy transfers, the way these objects react to an external field are very similar. For the first time, this book offers an introduction to the physics of these soft materials in one single volume. A variety of experiments and concepts are presented, including the phenomena of capillarity and wetting, fractals, small volumes and large surfaces, colloids, surfactants, giant micelles and fluid membranes, polymers, and liquid crystals. Each chapter is written by experts in the field with the aim of making the book accessible to the widest possible scientific audience: graduate students, lecturers, and research scientists in physics, chemistry, and other disciplines. Nobel Prize winner Pierre-Gilles de Gennes inspired this book and has written a foreword.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book covers many aspects of theoretical and observational star formation: low-mass star formation; young circumstellar discs; computational methods; triggered star formation; the stellar initial mass function; high-mass star formation; and stellar clusters. Each section starts with a review paper, followed by papers discussing recent theoretical and observational work. This volume summarises our current understanding of star formation and is useful for both graduate students and researchers alike.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Autosolitons are often observed as highly nonequilibrium regions in slightly nonequilibrium systems, in many ways resembling ball lightning which occurs in the atmosphere. A new approach to problems of self-organization and turbulence is developed, treating these phenomena as a result of spontaneous formation and subsequent evolution of autosolitons. Scenarios of self-organization involve sophisticated interactions between autosolitons, whereas turbulence is regarded as a pattern of autosolitons which appear and disappear at random in different parts of the system. This is the first monograph to provide a comprehensive summary of the theory of autosolitons as developed by the authors over many years of research. It will be of value for researchers and graduate students whose work involves the physics of nonequilibrium media, semiconductors, plasmas and self-organization.

Hydrogen is the most difficult atomic species to analyze by traditional methods, but nuclear physics methods are particularly suited for this purpose. President of the Uzbek SSR Academy of Sciences P.K. Khabibullaev and Professor B.G. Skorodumov discuss in this book the characteristics of these methods, such as lower detection limits, selectivity in respect to different isotopes, accuracy, depth resolution and maximum detection depth. Examples of applications that are dealt with include the determination of material humidity, the dating of objects, the study of hydrogen diffusion including non-stationary processes, and the investigation of changes in material properties like superconductivity, plasticity and electrical properties due to contamination by hydrogen.

The aim of this series of workshops is to provide a periodic (triennial) and in-depth assessment of advances in the study and understanding of the effects that electron-electron interactions in solids have on the determination of measurable properties of materials. The workshop is structured to include exposure to experimental work, to phenomenology, and to ab initio theory. Since correlation effects are pervasive the workshop aims to concentrate on the identification of promising developing methodology, experimental and theoretical, addressing the most critical frontier issues of electron correlations on the properties of materials. This series of workshops is distinguished from other topical meetings and conferences in that it strongly promotes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of correlations, involving the fields of quantum chemistry, physics, and materials science.

This book presents a critical examination of the latest experimental results and confronts them with the predictions of the Standard Model. Besides discussions of accelerator results from LEP, HERA and the TEVATRON, attention is paid to the unresolved problems of neutrino oscillations, CP violation, dark matter and cosmology. New theoretical ideas are also analyzed in order to explore possible extensions of the standard model. Realistic plans for future accelerators are presented and their physics potential is discussed, paving the way for the next generation of particle physics experiments.

There is comprehensive coverage of a range of established and emerging applications: biomagnetism, geophysics, nondestructive evaluation, detection of unexploded ordnance, and gravity gradiometry. The principles of both dc and rf SQUIDS are discussed extensively, as are the geometries, electronic circuitry and analysis techniques required to maximise performance. A major chapter of SQUID gradiometers in real environments presents original information on how to minimise noise from external sources. The discussions of biomagnetism describe the growing importance of neuromagnetometry with systems employing over 100 SQUID sensors, as well as the emergence of magnetocardiography and foetal heartbeat monitoring. Analysis techniques relevant to both biomagnetism and nondestructive evaluation are presented in depth.

Numerical methods for matrix diagonalization are described as well as finite-size scaling techniques and their conformal extensions. Many exercises are included. Applications treat the Ising, Potts, chiral Potts, Yang-Lee, percolation and XY models, the XXZ chain, linear polymers, tricritical points, conformal turbulence, surface criticality and profiles, defect lines and aperiodically modulated systems, persistent currents and dynamical scaling. The vicinity of the critical point is studied culminating in the exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical temperature in a magnetic field.

Robert Oppenheimer (1904–67) represented the new sociocultural power of the American intellectual. Catapulted to fame as director of the Los Alamos atomic weapons laboratory, Oppenheimer occupied a key position in the compact between science and the state that developed out of World War II. By tracing the making—and unmaking—of Oppenheimer’s wartime and postwar scientific identity, Charles Thorpe illustrates the struggles over the role of the scientist in relation to nuclear weapons, the state, and culture.A stylish intellectual biography, Oppenheimer maps out changes in the roles of scientists and intellectuals in twentieth-century America, ultimately revealing transformations in Oppenheimer’s persona that coincided with changing attitudes toward science in society.""This is an outstandingly well-researched book, a pleasure to read and distinguished by the high quality of its observations and judgments. It will be of special interest to scholars of modern history, but non-specialist readers will enjoy the clarity that Thorpe brings to common misunderstandings about his subject.""—Graham Farmelo, Times Higher Education Supplement""A fascinating new perspective....Thorpe’s book provides the best perspective yet for understanding Oppenheimer’s Los Alamos years, which were critical, after all, not only to his life but, for better or worse, the history of mankind.""—Catherine Westfall, Nature   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is concerned with the philosophy, the methods, and the fundamental concepts and postulates of physical science.  Physics is taken as the basic science and the laws of physics are shown to form the foundations of astronomy, chemistry, and physical sciences in general.  The emphasis is on methods and fundamental principles rather than the memorization of soon-forgotten facts.  Each of the fundamental laws of physics is covered in a separate chapter illustrating how the law was conceived, what it means, and how it may be applied.  Basic laws are clarified by showing their application to topics of current interest.  Another unique feature is the inclusion of laboratory experiments at the end of many chapters.

The book reveals the deep connection between gravitational, quantum and statistical physics and also the importance of black hole behaviour in the very early universe. An important new point discussed concerns the introduction of spin in the physics of black holes, showing its central role when correctly put into the Einstein equations through the geometric concept of torsion, with the new concept of a time-temperature uncertainty relation, minimal time, minimal entropy, quantization of entropy and the connection of black hole with wormholes. Besides theoretical aspects, the reader will also find observational evidence for black holes in active galactic nuclei, in binary X-ray sources and in supernova remnants. The book will thus interest physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists at different levels of their career who specialize in classical properties, quantum processes, statistical thermodynamics, numerical collapse, observational evidence, general relativity and other related problems.

This book presents 28 papers based on invited review talks and a panel discussion on 'The Nature of High Redshift Objects'. The major themes include: the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium, Galaxy Formation and Evolution, Cooling Flows, Quasars and Radiation Backgrounds, and Interactions between Galaxies/AGNs and their Environment. Recent advances with the ROSAT, COBE and Hubble Space Telescope are discussed, together with current theoretical developments.  The tutorial nature of the papers make this book a valuable supplement for professional astonomers, graduate students, and senior undergraduates. As with previous Tetons conferences, this book provides both the current state of observational and theoretical research and material complementary to courses in extragalactic and interstellar astrophysics.

The presentation begins with the fundamental ideas of averages and ensembles, focusing on classical systems described by continuous variables such as position and momentum, and using the ideal gas as an example. It then turns to quantum systems, beginning with diatomic molecules and working up through blackbody radiation and chemical equilibria. The discussion of equilibrium properties of systems of interacting particles includes presents such techniques as cluster expansions and distribution functions and uses non-ideal gases, liquids, and solutions as examples. Dynamic behavior - treated more extensively than in other texts - is discussed from the point of view of correlation functions. The text concludes with a problem of current research, namely diffusion in a suspension of interacting hard spheres and what can be learned about such a system from scattered light. Intended for a one-semester course, the text includes several ""asides"" on topics that are usually omitted from introductory courses, as well as numerous problems at the ends of chapters.

"Ludwig Prandtl - ein Lebensbild ; Erinnerungen, Dokumente",Johanna Vogel-Prandtl,physics,,/works/OL20932159W,/authors/OL8012163A/Johanna_Vogel-Prandtl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language German,"Mit der Berufung Ludwig Prandtls als Professor für Angewandte Mechanik wurde die kleine Universitätsstadt Göttingen im Jahr 1904 zur Wiege der modernen Strömungsmechanik und Aerodynamik. Prandtl begründete hier nicht nur mit der Aerodynamischen Versuchsanstalt (AVA) und dem Kaiser- Wilhelm-Institut für Strömungsforschung zwei Forschungseinrichtungen von Weltrang, sondern auch mit der so genannten »Göttinger Schule« eine außergewöhnlich fruchtbare wissenschaftliche Denkweise, die sich durch eine eigentümliche Balance von physikalischer Intuition und mathematischer Exaktheit auszeichnet. Die wissenschaftliche Methode Prandtls und seiner Schüler hat ihren Niederschlag in zahlreichen Dissertationen, Monographien und Lehrbüchern gefunden, die mittlerweile als klassisch gelten und damit zum Grundbestand der Strömungslehre gehören. Doch viele dieser Publikationen sind seit langer Zeit nicht mehr verfügbar. Die Reihe »Göttinger Klassiker der Strömungsmechanik« stellt deshalb ausgewählte Publikationen, die der Göttinger Schule um Ludwig Prandtl zuzurechnen sind oder in einem gewissen historischen Bezug dazu stehen, wieder zur Verfügung. Die sehr persönliche Biografie Ludwig Prandtls, zusammengestellt von seiner jüngeren Tochter Johanna Vogel-Prandtl, wird durch zahlreiche Fotos aus Prandtls Arbeits- und Privatleben ergänzt. Sie rundet das Bild des Gründungsvaters der modernen Strömungsmechanik ab, dessen wissenschaftliche Bedeutung bis auf den heutigen Tag nachwirkt.

It reviews the specifications and applications of the 100 MeV linear accelerator currently in operation at NPS and compares it with the performance of the proposed equipment. Estimates of radiation production and area dosages from the flash X-ray machine, as well as proposals for equipment location and shielding design, are presented. Laboratory requirements for electrical power, space, radiation monitoring, equipment interlocks and safety awareness, as well as federal regulation application to and installation of this type, are considered. Finally, research and thesis opportunities through the improved and unique capabilities of the flash X-ray machine are presented, along with some suggestions for proposed experiments and applications.

Cromar,physics,First published in 1984,/works/OL24937618W?edition=ia%3Acomparisonofcalc00crom,/authors/OL9399631A/Patrick_F._Cromar,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL33148159M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1984|Publisher  Naval Postgraduate School|Language English,In this thesis results are presented from a study of the off-axis X and Gamma radiation field caused by a highly relativistic electron beam in liquid Nitrogen at various path lengths out to 2 radiation lengths. The off-axis dose in Silicon was calculated using electron/photon transport code CYLTRAN and measured using thermal luminescent dosimeters (TLD's). Calculations were performed on a CDC-7600 computer ar Los Alamos National Laboratory and measurements were made using the Naval Postgraduate School 100 Mev Linac. Comparison of the results is made and CYLTRAN is found to be in agreement with experimentally measured values. The CYLTRAN results are extended to the off-axis dose caused by a 100 Mev electron beam in air at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)   Read more Read less,0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Augmented by the work of Topping these data span a range of (q sup 2) from 0.05 (fm sup -2) to 0.50 (fm sup -2). From these, the electric form factor of the neutron, (G sub E sub n), was extracted using three Lomon-Feshbach wave functions for the deuteron, (LF1, LF5, and LF15). Values of the slope of (G sub E sub n) versus q2 were measured to be 0.0218 plus or minus 0.0022 for LF1, 0.0220 plus or minus 0.0022 for LF5, and 0.0185 plus or minus 0.0022 for LF15. Although the data seems to prefer model LF15, all were found to be in agreement with the thermal neutron-electron slope of 0.0193 plus or minus 0.0004.

It is possible to generate a low frequency wave using the self-demodulation of a short, high frequency, finite amplitude pulse produced by the non-linear properties of the medium. The generated low frequency wave will theoretically have the high directivity of the primary wave while simultaneously possessing the bottom penetrating characteristics of the lower frequency. Measurements demonstrate that the pulse self-demodulation occurs as theoretically predicted, and the results are successfully applied to the design of the sonar system. Shallow water tests demonstrating the potential effectiveness of the sonar system for detection and classification of target objects in bottom sediments are also described.

Radiation signatures from an external relativist electron beam,Kyoum Bok Wee,physics,First published in 1988,/works/OL16869208W?edition=ia%3Aradiationsignatu00week,/authors/OL7186947A/Kyoum_Bok_Wee,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25492366M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1988|Publisher  Naval Postgraduate School|Language English|Pages 60,"X-band radiation has been observed which occurs when an electron beam travelling in air traverses an aluminum plate. The radiation pattern is more complicated than can be explained with a simplified model of Cerenkov radiation from air and transition radiation from the aluminum-air interface. The empirical observation is that the peak angle decreases with energy until about 70 MeV, then increases with energy. The angular width of the peak distribution shows a similar behavior with energy. The observed peak angle decreases as the distance from the horn antenna to the aluminum foil is increased. The explanation of the radiation distribution observed is not yet satisfactory. A major improvement in the data accumulation process has been introduced by measuring radiation at a fixed angle as data is taken with a movable horn. This procedure allows us to compensate for the fluctuating electron beam intensity. The data can now be digitized and stored in a computer for analysis. Previous experiments allowed only for analog measurements. Further work, both theoretical and experimental, will be required to understand fully the radiation signature of the electron beam.

Effects of charge distribution within a particle beam on the sub-Cerenkov radiation,Yun Su Jung,physics,First published in 1987,/works/OL16895091W?edition=ia%3Aeffectsofcharged00jung,/authors/OL7194112A/Yun_Su_Jung,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25515849M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1987|Publisher  Naval Postgraduate School,              Available from National Technical Information Service|Language English|Pages 90","The charge distribution of periodic electron beam pulses generates patterns of sub-Cerenkov radiation distinctive of the distribution of charge with in a bunch. Mapping the radiation pattern from different charge shapes may provide insight into whether charge pulse shapes can be determined from observed radiation patterns. The radiation patterns of Gaussian, Level, and Trapezoidal function were mapped by computer simulation. Near 90 degree to the beam, the radiation patterns of all three charge distributions developed an envelope proportional to the fourier transform of the charge bunch distribution when the wavelength of the emitted radiation was comparable to the size of the bunch. For the Gaussian function, the envelope is Gaussian, for the level function it is a sinc function. Since the envelope for the trapezoidal function in the product of two sinc functions it is more difficult to analyze. This work may provide a basis for determining the charge shape of electron beam pulses from the sub-Cerenkov radiation based on the radiation intensity pattern.

The pressure amplitude along the bottom rapidly falls off for distances closer to the apex than that at which adiabatic-mode theory predicts cut-off for the lowest mode. This distance is termed the dump distance for an acoustically fast-bottom condition. In the case of a slow bottom, because the speed of sound ratio is greater than 1, the dump distance does not exist. To facilitate scaling the acoustic fields, a scaling distance is introduced.

The new refrigerator has no sliding seals, a cycle frequency of about 300 hz, and uses acoustic resonance to enhance the overall power density and efficiency. This thesis is concerned specifically with the design and testing of the electrodynamic transducer which is responsible for the electro-acoustic power conversion. A computer model of the driver/resonator system is presented along with the techniques for measurement of the electrical and mechanical parameters used as input for the model. A final driver design (including dimensional drawings) utilizing a modified JBL 2450J neodymium-iron-boron compression driver and associated leak tight electrical feed-throughs, microphone, accelerometer, pressure gage, pressure housing, and resonator interface is provided.

The model considers the variation from unity to be a function of the absorption cross section. Below the ionization threshold, the cross section is a set of discrete transitions between the various energy levels of the specie of concern. Above the 5p level, the discrete transitions become indistinct and the continuum cross section function is extended into this region. The continuum cross section function is a polynomial function fitted to independent research results. The results for Neon I agree with previous theoretical and experimental results. The model is extended to Neon(3s). Comparison with the results of independent research of the polarizability and cavity phase shift derived from the calculation indicate accuracy is within ten percent.

It is found that the experimental measurement of X-ray Cerenkov radiation is possible for the carbon K (283.84 eV), aluminum L1 (87.01 eV) and L2,3 (72.78 eV) absorption edges. Measurement in the aluminum K (1559.9 eV) absorption edge region was found to be not possible since the real part of the index of refraction did not exceed unity. The relative power from Cerenkov radiation was calculated for the three possible cases and count rate estimates were given. The experimental apparatus for the measurement of X-ray Cerenkov radiation was redesigned to allow measurement of the carbon K edge and aluminum L1 edge. An experiment was attempted, but not completed due to the failure of a necessary preamplifier for a proportional counter. New design considerations were presented and incorporated changes to avoid the experimental shortcomings of previous measurements.

The characteristics of reduced-density channels in NH3-N2 gas mixtures,William A.

Interferometers were used to record the changing density resulting from the NH3 absorption of the CO2 laser radiation. One method used to determine the characteristics of the channel was based on the assumption that the resulting density profile was Gaussian shaped. The second method used the Abel Integral Transformation, requiring no pre-conditions on the density profile expect that it was cylindrically symmetric. While used extensively in plasma spectroscopy, this technique is not generally well known for analyzing interferometric data. The results show that for a fixed laser energy long, shallow reduced density channels were formed in gas mixtures of low ammonia concentration and short, deep channels were formed in gas mixtures high ammonia concentration. These results qualitatively agree with an earlier experiment in which gas mixtures of nitrogen and sulfur-hexafluoride were used. Both experiments support the concept of reduced-density channel formation and lay the foundation for future studies of relativistic electron beam propagation for application in the Strategic Defense Initiative.

The system was utilized experimentally to verify theoretical predictions of the correlation of the two paths as a function of the relative path geometry. The apparatus utilized alternating optical pulses from the two paths. The detection system employed two signal processing channels wtih electronic switching to permit sampling alternating source pulses with a time separation of 0.30 miliseconds. Several equipment trials and one field experiment were conducted. The results demonstrated good correlation with the theory previously developed in an accompanying project.

For backscatter the B-T and H-K solutions are found to differ significantly, especially near the surface of the half-plane, where the B-T solution gives close agreement with experiment. For forward scatter the two exact solutions and experimental data are in agreement. B-T is found to agree well with measurements of diffraction by a barrier perpendicular to a rigid base. By considering source and source image in the base separately the concept of 'image of the source in the barrier' is found to be unnecessary. Use of the time domain form of B-T solution in calculating the forward diffraction near a corner and behind a thin strip is shown to give results which agree well with measured data. Secondary diffraction effects are observed in the measurements of diffraction by a thin strip, a non-vertical barrier and a thick edge.

Using the Naval Postgraduate School 100 MeV linear accelerator, off-axis radiation dose was measured with calcium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at various path lengths out to two radiation lengths. The off-axis dose was calculated using the electron transport code CYLTRAN of the integrated TIGER series of coupled electron/photon Monte Carlo transport codes. Calculations were performed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Comparison with the results is made and CYLTRAN is found to be in agreement with experimentally measured values. The extension of results from one medium (water) to another (air) appears to be valid.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Backward and forward diffraction from a 90 degree wedge and a thin plate are analyzed. Attempts to measure the diffracted energy in the illuminated region over the apex of the barrier, where direct and reflected signals coexist with diffracted, are discussed. Factors influencing the choice of the barriers' physical dimensions and composition are listed, as are the problems surrounding the selection of an ideal sound source and receiver. Finally, the data are compared to the theory by Biot and Tolstoy (Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, v. 29, 1957) and found to be in good agreement with predictions.

Buskirk and J.R. Neighbours for the power in the diffraction pattern of Cerenkov radiation from periodic bunches in air is experimentally tested at the Naval Postgraduate School Accelerator Laboratory (NPSAL). Previous experiments done at NPSAL are briefly reviewed. The experiment focuses on reducing RF noise and introduces a method for recording experimental data. RF noise is divided into two categories: (1) Noise received directly at the antenna; and (2) noise picked up by the cabling. Category 1 is divided into two subcategories: (a) Cerenkov radiation received by the antenna after being reflected off secondary objects; and (b) residual klystron radiation. Experimental data curves from the third harmonic are compared to theoretical patterns for various finite emission lengths and angle shifts. The data demonstrates that noise-generated fine structure which appeared in a previous experiment at NPSAL can be eliminated with increased shielding.

The results clearly show that coherent transition radiation produces larger emission angles at high beam energies than does incoherent radiation. These results allow the possibility of using coherent transition to measure higher electron beam energies than are possible using incoherent radiation approximations. The measured emission angle magnitudes are compared to theoretical values obtained using computer simulation. Differences are noted and possible sources of error are cited.

The experiment is an effort to verify the theoretical prediction of the power increase and fall off with discrete harmonic frequency in the microwave region. The radiation diagrams and absolute power measurements in the far field for the first four harmonics are provided by the improvements such as:  frequency selection by the YIG filter, power amplification by the TWT amplifiers, high sensitivity of the signal detection by the oscilloscope vertical differential amplifier along with the noise reduction and radiation shielding. Suggested experimental method may be expanded to the higher harmonics with appropriate equipment. The experimental data reveal the unexpected spikes in the radiation diagrams. The absolute power results are reasonably cose to the theoretical ones. The experimental method satifies this Cerenkov experiment and may be improved. Further research may provide usable information for the electron beam monitoring or Cerenkov source at higher micorwave frequencies, for which a certain interest exists.

The representation of this distribution is presented in terms of a function called the form factor. Theory is developed which uses two dimensionless quantities to study the form factor effects. These are the emission length to wavelength ratio and the bunch length to wavelength ratio. A prediction is made for conditions which allows a concentration of radiation ninety degrees to the beam. Results are reported of experiments which were performed to measure the effects of the form factor using parameters available at the Naval Postgraduate School's linear accelerator. Findings from these experiments along with suggestions for further research are included. Keywords include: Microwave Cerenkov Radiation; and Stimulated Cerenkov Radiation.

This technique involved measuring the standard deviations of the upwind and crosswind profiles of the elliptical glitter patterns occurring for illumination of the water surface with a point source near thelaser radar system. A pencil beam laser radar from a companion project simulataneously measured the reflected signals from the water surface. The glitter pattern images were recorded with a video camera and recorder. The images for each run were later digitized along theri major and minor elliptic asxed and averaged over 256 images to produced smooth intensity curvers from which the standard deviations were measured. The radar returen fluctuated over a large range becasue of the rapid variation of individual water surface facets, and so was recorded and time averaged voer the sam interval as the video images. Data sufficient for empirical preduciton of expected mean laser return signal were obtained. This is necessary to permit evaluation of the performance of a given laser radar design. The data obtained als approximated the predictions of a new model proposed in this work.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Experiments with the SCATHA ion gun were monitored by charged particle detectors and the electric field experiment. It was found that the electric field experiment could be used to measure satellite potential during ion beam emission in sunlight and eclipse. Unneutralized ion beam emission in high energy (1-2 KeV) and high current (1-2 mA) modes resulted in the satellite momentarily charging to a negative potential near the magnitude of the beam voltage and then rising to some less negative value, typically -500 to -800 v. The net emitted current was apparently limited by the formation of a virtual anode. Low current (20-30 microamp), high voltage (1 kV) resulted in -10 to -50 V satellite potentials. Trickle mode (20-80 microamp, no accel voltage) operations resulted in satellite potentials near zero volts. In sunlight the spacecraft potential exhibited a spin modulation, attributed to variations in the neutralization of the beam as it passed through the photoelectron cloud. Rapid fluctuations of the spacecraft potential occured which may be explained qualitatively by space charge instabilities. Theses.

These calculations indicate that surface sputtering creates a sufficient flux to account for the observed phenomena. The NASA Charging Analyzer program was run to determine the trajectories for measured particles. The calculated trajectories were determined to lead to the spacecraft surface, again indicating that surface emission was the source.

A discussion on the production of 'glassy' surfaces on various metals, and their susceptability to unipolar arcing is also presented. All experiments were conducted using a neodymium glass laser in a Q- switched mode to generate a hot plasma. Results show that stainless steel and mild commercial steel arc are very heavily, in agreement with past researchers, while titanium undergoes arcing at a lesser crater density but over a greater surface area, HY 130 undergoes arcing at a low crater density, and a commercially prepared metallic glass Fe80B20 and Poco graphite not at all. Experiments were conducted in attempt to produce metallic glass coatings on stainless steel, HY 130, and a mild commercial steel (1030). Coatings produced were exposed to a laser produced plasma and arcing was found to be present in all cases but at a lower arc density. In conjunction with attempts to produce metallic glass surface coatings on metals, an experiment was done to determine the energy density required for the onset of plasma production in type 304 stainless steel.

A 75-KHz source was tracked at six depths at each of six horizontal ranges. The data were analyzed by the NAVTORPSTA NUTRACK III isovelocity-layer computer program and by an isogradient-layer program developed here, STUTRACK I. The results show that a low signal-to-noise ratio is not a problem even at long distances and that an isogradient analysis yields superior results with less environmental data than does the isovelocity method.

The physical world,Nicholas Manton,physics,First published in 2017,/works/OL19733253W,/authors/OL6486257A/Nicholas_Manton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 556,"""The book offers a grand vision of the essential unity of physics that will enable the reader to see the world through the eyes of a physicist and ultimately to think like a physicist. The text follows Einstein's dictum that 'explanations should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler', to give an honest account of how modern physicists understand their subject, including the shortcomings of current theory. The result is an up-to-date and engaging portrait of physics that contains concise derivations of the important results in a style where every step in a derivation is clearly explained, so that anyone with the appropriate mathematical skills will find the text easy to digest. The book concentrates on the conceptual principles of each branch of physics and shows how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Emphasis is placed on the use of variational principles in physics, and in particular the principle of least action, an approach that lies at the heart of modern theoretical physics, but has been neglected in most introductory accounts of the subject""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
