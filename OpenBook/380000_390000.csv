New Directions in Organization Theory,Timothy Hallinan,management,First published in 1968,/works/OL3517303W,/authors/OL1960669A/Timothy_Hallinan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date September 1968|Publisher  Rand Corp.|Language English|Pages 14,"A short intellectual history of organization theory and an analysis of current trends in the discipline. Two analytical frameworks within five schools of thought are identified. The traditional approach concentrates on the formal, closed-ended aspects (e.g., goals, tasks, bureaucratic problems) of an organization. The other approach views the organization as an open-ended system. Schools within this framework study the informal organizations, such as social pressures, and the organization itself as a problem-solving entity, while de-emphasizing the classical rational-choice theory of decision making. The present rapid growth of the field will probably slow as it develops a limiting paradigm and as its dependency on empirical data increases.

In vergelijking met de wereld van de profit zal er immers meer sprake zijn van ideologische doelstellingen en bijvoorbeeld kwalitatieve output-metingen in plaats van concrete verkoopresultaten. Een erfgoedprofessional heeft geleerd activiteiten effectief te organiseren en begrijpt hoe de processen in erfgoedorganisaties werken. Management in deze wereld heeft o.a. betrekking op organisatiekunde, cultuurbeleid, financieel management en recht. Ook het vakgebied marketing beschouwen wij in dit verband als onderdeel van management. Bij marketing wordt ingegaan op de wijze waarop een culturele organisatie kan inspelen op de wensen van het gewenste publiek door de inzet van marketingproducten. Wij hopen dat ook de erfgoedsector, zoals het middenkader van musea, archieven en instellingen op het gebied van monumenten, archeologie en immaterieel erfgoed, zijn voordeel met dit cahier kan doen.

The contributors in this collection of essays place water disputes in larger political, historical and scientific contexts and discuss how the humanities and social sciences contribute towards this understanding. The authors contend that international sharing of scientific and technological advances can significantly increase access to water and improve water quality. While scientific advances can and should increase adaptability to changing environmental conditions, especially climate change, national institutional reform and the strengthening of joint commissions are vital. The contributors indicate ways in which cooperation can move from simple coordination to sophisticated, adaptive and equitable modes of water management.

Ondernemen in de Open Samenleving,Rutger Claassen,management,First published in 2019,/works/OL23501374W,/authors/OL7806222A/Rutger_Claassen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Pages 112,"Internationale markten zijn de afgelopen decennia sterk mondiaal ontwikkeld en veel bedrijven zijn in deze geglobaliseerde context uitgegroeid tot belangrijke, quasi-politieke spelers. Deze stormachtige economische ontwikkelingen bieden kansen en welvaart aan velen, maar kennen echter ook schaduwzijden, van milieubelasting tot belastingontwijking. In deze bundel verkennen de auteurs het idee van de ‘open samenleving’ om vat te krijgen op deze nieuwe realiteit. De open samenleving naar het ideaal van Popper, waarin mensen de vrijheid hebben om hun mening uit te drukken, initiatief te nemen, en elkaar tegen te spreken, wordt gezien als de grondslag voor vrijheid, welvaart, en vooruitgang. Deze bundel onderzoekt of de toegenomen openheid van markten de open samenleving als politiek ideaal dichterbij heeft gebracht. De auteurs werpen vanuit verschillende perspectieven een kritisch licht op de bedreigingen die voortvloeien uit mondiale markten en de toegenomen macht van ondernemingen. Ze stellen óók de vraag of het gedachtegoed van de open samenleving inspiratie kan bieden bij het tegengaan van die bedreigingen. Kunnen nieuwe vormen en interpretaties van ‘openheid’ worden gevonden, die tegenwicht bieden tegen de excessen van de vrijemarkteconomie?

This collection of papers (PSW-GTR-237) summarizes the state of the science in some topics relevant to this forest management approach, presents case studies of collaborative planning efforts and field implementation of these new practices, and clarifies some of the concepts presented in GTR 220. It also describes a method for assessing forest heterogeneity at the stand level using the Forest Vegetation Simulator and a new geographic information system tool for project level planning that classifies a landscape into different topographic categories. While this collection of papers presents information and applications relevant to implementation, it does not offer standards and prescriptions. Forest management should be flexible to adapt to local forest conditions and stakeholder interests. This report does, however, strive to clarify concepts and present examples that may improve communication with stakeholders and help build common ground for collaborative forest management.

But for many of us they can reach a point where they spoil or even ruin our lives. If you are over-anxious, and perhaps even suffer from panic attacks, you need to do something about it. But what? Maybe you're not sure about going to the doctor. Even if it helps, you don't just want a quick-fix cure for the symptoms (though in the short term that would be a big help). You want to be the sort of person who doesn't fret and worry so much in the first place. Caroline Carr is a writer and therapist with both personal and professional experience of anxiety. She understands how anxiety can blight your life, and writes in a straightforward, easy and sympathetic style. She has a wealth of tips, ideas, strategies, techniques and case studies to share. She will help you: Understand the nature and causes of anxiety; Find a choice of treatments and approaches to try (we're all different, after all); Consider what alternative therapies are available; Discover strategies that will help you; Find ways to help loved ones who are worried or anxious. Most of all, she will help you rebuild your confidence so that in future you can stay in control of your anxiety, instead of letting it control you.

Although Colombia has a maritime window on the world it has      historically underutilized and underprotected its sea resources. This study argues that the Colombian Government      does not have an effective and clear vision as a maritime nation. Chapter 1 presents the research questions and a      brief background of Colombia. In Chapter II, a model of the current maritime management of Colombia is      developed. In Chapter III, this model is compared with similar management models used in other Latin American      countries. Chapter IV is an Organizational Analysis of Colombia's maritime related agencies. Chapter V      develops and suggests a strategy to better manage maritime activities in Colombia. Finally, the study's      conclusions and recommendations are presented. The study concludes that Colombia as a state has a low      maritime consciousness and that there is no common maritime vision to support government policies. The study      recommends that an advisory and coordination entity be set up to help create this vision and provide for long-      term management of Colombia's maritime resources.

Manual de escritura para carreras de humanidades,Federico Navarro,management,First published in 2014,/works/OL17352828W,/authors/OL7289099A/Federico_Navarro,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25930563M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Universidad de Buenos Aires|Language Spanish|Pages 354,"La formación del grado universitario no consiste solamente en la adquisición de contenidos sino, sobre todo, en la enculturación de los estudiantes en las prácticas académicas que configuran las esferas disciplinares. Se trata de que los estudiantes se apropien de las formas socialmente consensuadas de construir, negociar y comunicar el conocimiento en la universidad.  Un aspecto fundamental de este proceso de enculturación es, justamente, la apropiación de las prácticas de lectura y escritura científico-académicas, que se diferencian de las prácticas comunicativas de otros ámbitos sociales con los que los estudiantes pueden tener mayor familiaridad (Bazerman et al., 2005: xi).  Este libro no es una aproximación abstracta o accidentada a la enseñanza de la escritura, sino que materializa cuatro años de trabajo sistemático y de participación de muchas personas especializadas o genuinamente interesadas en las prácticas letradas en la universidad. Su existencia no sería posible sin el apoyo financiero inicial del Ministerio de Educación de la Nación en el marco del Proyecto de Apoyo a las Ciencias Humanas (PROHUM). Las autoridades de la Facultad de Filosofía y Letras impulsaron el proyecto desde un inicio, en particular Graciela Morgade, Secretaria de Asuntos Académicos durante su puesta en marcha y de quien dependió formalmente. En las investigaciones sobre las prácticas letradas en humanidades, resultaron fundamentales las perspectivas, sugerencias y donaciones de materiales escritos de directores y secretarios académicos de departamentos y de docentesinvestigadores de todas las carreras.

We wake up in a haze?often after hitting snooze a few times. Then we rush around to get ready and out the door so we can officially start the day. Before we know it, hours have slipped by without us accomplishing anything beyond downing a cup of coffee, dashing off a few emails, and dishing with our coworkers around the water cooler. By the time the workday wraps up, we?re so exhausted and defeated that any motivation to accomplish something in the evening has vanished.But according to time management expert Laura Vanderkam, mornings hold the key to taking control of our schedules. If we use them wisely, we can build habits that will allow us to lead happier, more productive lives.Drawing on real-life anecdotes and scientific research that shows why the early hours of the day are so important, Vanderkam reveals how successful people use mornings to help them accomplish things that are often impossible to take care of later in the day. While many of us are still in bed, these folks are scoring daily victories to improve their health, careers, and personal lives without sacrificing their sanity. For instance, former PepsiCo chairman and CEO Steve Reinemund would rise at 5:00 a.m., run four miles, pray, and eat breakfast with his family before heading to work to run a Fortune 500 company.What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast is a fun, practical guide that will inspire you to rethink your morning routine and jump-start your life before the day has even begun.

One of the 13 national FFS sites is the Northeastern Cascades site at Mission Creek on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The study area includes 12 forested stands that encompass a representative range of dry forest conditions in the northeastern Cascade Range.

One of the 13 national FFS sites is the Northeastern Cascades site at Mission Creek on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The study area includes 12 forested stands that encompass a representative range of dry forest conditions in the northeastern Cascade Range. We describe site histories and environmental settings, experimental design, field methods, and quantify the pretreatment composition and structure of vegetation, fuels, soils and soil biota, entomology and pathology, birds, and small mammals that occurred during the 2000 and 2001 field seasons. We also describe the implementation of thinning treatments completed during 2003 and spring burning treatments done during 2004 and 2006.

Identifying conflict prevention measures,Frida Mol̈ler,management,First published in 2010,/works/OL32242394W,/authors/OL11692923A/Frida_Mol̈ler,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Dept. of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University|Language English","The study of conflict prevention has only recently become more systematic and moved away from an exclusive reliance on case studies. With the efforts of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Folke Bernadotte Academy, a dataset of third party measures taken in armed conflicts at low intensity has been created. The dataset, Managing Intrastate Low-level Conflicts (MILC) covers all existing low-level armed conflicts for the period of 1993-2004. There is a lingering discussion regarding whether systematically collected data based on news media sources, other current reports and general insight actually captures the events that diplomats, mediators and other actors would regard as significant. Some would even question if systematic data like the MILC dataset can generate an accurate and unbiased account of the phenomena it tries to quantify. This study is responding to these concerns by comparing news based information with information based on memoirs and historical accounts. Analyzing the case of Burundi using both approaches, the purpose of this study is to see if different approaches will result ina similar or different understanding of third party activities in a particular crisis. Comparing the MILC dataset with data collected in other ways and using other types of material will help us understand the strengths and limitations of a systematic approach based on news reports. This in turn will provide a better foundation for interpreting and analysing this systematic data.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When an organization introduces change, they must do it right the first time.  Disruption is the new normal.  Succeeding in such turbulent times means organizations cannot afford to waste precious resources on failed projects.  This has led to a recognition that the tools, techniques and processes associated with project management can help organizations be successful. The primary purpose of this text is to provide an open source textbook that can be used in introductory project management courses. The objective is to develop a concise, widely applicable open source textbook that can be used in the for-profit and non-profit sectors.

While the approach is anlytical, the author has boiled it down to make it accessible to line managers and high level executives alike.  The key lessons involve basing risk estimates and prevention techniques on known quantities rather then subjective estimates, which many popular ERM methodologies consist of.  It will include practical examples from various industries that demonstrate key concepts, implementation guidance to get started, and tables of risk indicators and metrics, physical structure diagrams, and graphs.    Tentative Table of Contents:  Chapter 1 Corporate Governance:  What a Mess Chapter 2  What ERM Is And What It Is Not; Chapter 3 Understanding What the Business Is; Chapter 4  Defining What True Business Risk Is; Chapter 5  Objectively Defining Risk; Chapter 6 Building a Fluid/Dynamic Risk Model; Chapter 7  The Strategy: Evolving The Fluid Risk Model; Chapter 8  The Future Evolution of the Model; Chapter 9  Related Topics and Special Risk Situations; Chapter 10  Maximizing Impact - Minimizing Exposure""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I will not make you sort my M&Ms by colour. I will not take off four hours in the middle of the day to go shopping and then announce upon my return that “it’s going to be a late one—we need to catch up!” I will not request that you create and maintain my online dating profile. Welcome to the wickedly funny world of To My Assistant, where overworked and underappreciated assistants finally get their due. We’ve all been there. You might even be there right now. Do you depend upon your college education to handle crucial business decisions such as memorising your boss’ lunch order, trying to schedule four meetings where only one can go, and helping your boss detag Facebook photos? Or what about those awesome days when you’re instructed to “send me that thing from a week ago,” “call that guy I wanted to call,” or “book me a table at that restaurant that girl said was really good,” and are then berated when you’re not able to figure out immediately what your boss is talking about? This book compiles everything that disgruntled and optimistic assistants everywhere promise NEVER TO DO when, one day, they have assistants of their own. From ridiculous requests and backhanded compliments to outright insults, and complete with helpful tips and tricks for Boss Wrangling—like what you can learn about your boss’s mood from his meal choices, how to navigate such professional minefields as requests for your opinion and interactions with your boss’s children and pets, and advanced translation techniques for incoherent e-mails and text messages—these pages are just what the underpaid masses need to survive (and laugh at) the daily injustices of life at the bottom of the totem pole.""--Publisher description.

In this book, Steve Fleetwood and Anthony Hesketh take issue with this 'scientific' approach by arguing that its preoccupation with statistical analysis is misplaced because it fails to take account of the complexities of organisations and the full range of issues that influence individual performance. The book is split into three parts. Part I deconstructs research into the alleged link between people and business performance by showing that it cannot explain the associations it alleges. Part II attributes these shortcomings to the importation of spurious 'scientific' methods, before going on to suggest more appropriate methods that might be used in future. Finally, Part III explores how HR executives and professionals understand their work and shows how a critical realist stance adds value to this understanding through enhanced explanation""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
