The Galileo controversy has become a paragon of faith's supposed hostility towards science. Galileo believed that the earth rotated around the sun but did not have sufficient evidence to prove it. The Inquisition believed that unless such evidence existed the sun should continue to be considered to rotate around the earth. This booklet explains the facts of the Galileo case and traces the subsequent development of the myth that the Catholic Church has always been the enemy of science. This history proves that even in the Galileo case, the Church remained true to its belief that faith and reason belong together. (From back cover).

Six Areas of Growth in the Lord,Chevelle Bacon,religion,First published in 2022,/works/OL28909341W,/authors/OL10700714A/Chevelle_Bacon,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL39743179M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Primedia eLaunch LLC|Language English,"SIX AREAS OF GROWTH IN THE LORD INTRODUCTION  This writing is far from an exhaustive (complete / finished) study on growth. However, this event is my testimony (written or spoken statement) of what the Lord has taught me, now in my life, about growth in the living God. Hence, in this writing I will attempt to show God at work in what I call the Six Areas of Growth. In 1970, at 12 years old God called my name and spoke to me in an audible voice and said, “pray unto me” and “read my Word.” After obedience to God's instructions, my life changed and the lives of 2 adults in the family. Over the years, I have witnessed first-hand the power of God to change, heal, deliver, and bless others. You cannot have an encounter with Christ Jesus and remain the same. In the years of ministering to others, I have noticed one main theme that occurs – the enemy (devil, demons) will attack when we are most vulnerable (defenseless) in childhood. I've seen people give their lives to God, yet they wrestle with themselves in dealing with the past issues of childhood trauma and hurts, which untreated will and can stunt growth in God. I pray that my personal testimonies and scriptures referenced in this writing will encourage and bring a realization that God’s love and power goes beyond anything we face in this life. God Bless.

What makes your faith the correct one? Perhaps another belief system has it right instead. The fact is many people know little about their own faith, let alone other faiths. Religion and Man: Our Story offers an illuminating peek inside major world religions and how they developed. From primitive tribal beliefs to modern organized religion, the history of man s search for answers is as diverse and varied as the many faiths that have existed. Why did belief systems develop in the first place? And what prompted their evolution through time? Religion and Man: Our Story provides answers to these common questions with this easy-to-read primer on comparative religious thought. Apppropriate for everyone from the casual reader to the aspiring theologian, the book begins by examining the creation of our universe through to the dawn of mankind. It goes on to explain in simple terms how religious thought evolved into the array of belief systems we know today. The misunderstanding of other religions and cultures has long divided people. Religion and Man: Our Story will clear up the confusion."" --Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Religious market structure, religious participation, and outcomes",Jonathan Gruber,religion,First published in 2005,/works/OL5859953W,/authors/OL1439098A/Jonathan_Gruber,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Religion plays an important role in the lives of many Americans, but there is relatively little study by economists of the implications of religiosity for economic outcomes.  This likely reflects the enormous difficulty inherent in separating the causal effects of religiosity from other factors that are correlated with outcomes.  In this paper, I propose a potential solution to this long standing problem, by noting that a major determinant of religious participation is religious market density, or the share of the population in an area which is of an individual's religion.  I make use of the fact that exogenous predictions of market density can be formed based on area ancestral mix.  That is, I relate religious participation and economic outcomes to the correlation of the religious preference of one's own heritage with the religious preference of other heritages that share one's area.  I use the General Social Survey (GSS) to model the impact of market density on church attendance, and micro-data from the 1990 Census to model the impact on economic outcomes.  I find that a higher market density leads to a significantly increased level of religious participation, and as well to better outcomes according to several key economic indicators: higher levels of education and income, lower levels of welfare receipt and disability, higher levels of marriage, and lower levels of divorce""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

This work is particularly aimed at understanding Jefferson in light of claims made about him by some religious conservatives, especially those by David Barton. ... The aims of this work are quite simple: to be dispassionate in the analysis of the claims about Jefferson and to understand the events in question in their proper theological and cultural context. ... The plan of the book is to take church and state claims first followed by a focus on Jefferson's personal views of the Bible and religion. Then, we [the authors] briefly examine claims relating to the University of Virginia and close with an examination of Jefferson's views of race and his actions as a slave owner."" - p. xi-xiii.

They can affect our relationships with loved ones, and how we function in our work. They play a profound role in how we feel about ourselves, and can even affect our physical health. And we are too often trapped in the dilemma of ""expression"" versus ""repression."" Expressing our emotions can often hurt others, but by repressing them – even in the benevolent guise of ""self-control"" – we risk hurting ourselves.  Osho offers a third alternative, which is to understand the roots of our emotions and to develop the knack of watching them and learning from them as they arise, rather than being ""taken over"" by them. Eventually we find that even the most challenging and difficult situations no longer have the power to provoke us and cause us pain. Osho's unique insight into the workings of the mind, the heart, and the essence or ""being"" of the individual goes far beyond the understandings of conventional psychology. Over more than three decades of work with people from all walks of life, he has developed simple techniques and insights to help modern-day men and women to rediscover their own inner silence and wisdom.

For centuries, the theism-atheism debate has been dominated by two positions: stringent believers committed to the “yes, there is a God” argument, and atheists vehemently driven to repudiate not only God, but also religion as a cultural institution. To date, this is the first and only mainstream book in which a nonbeliever criticizes atheism and affirms religion.An Atheist Defends Religion persuasively argues that religion is overwhelmingly beneficial for humanity, regardless of whether God exists, based on a new paradigm of 10 affirmative dimensions that make up religious experience. It also puts to rest the theory that religion is behind most of the world’s sectarian violence by showing that religion becomes evil when it is politicized. Readers will learn they do not have to be fundamentalists to be believers, and about the value and benefits of religion itself.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But what if, perhaps, ""rib"" was a mistranslation and the body part she was really created from was Adam's penis bone? This would explain why human males don't have such a bone, unlike other male mammals. That's only one of many surprising and fun biblical twists readers will encounter in The Uncensored Bible. Here readers will learn that King David swore like a sailor, mandrakes were the biblical equivalent of Viagra®, Cain was depressed, and Joseph's ""coat of many colors"" might have actually been a dress (which may explain why his brothers picked on him).Authors Kaltner, McKenzie, and Kilpatrick bring some of the most outrageous speculations about the scriptures to light—all based on legitimate scholarship—revealing a stranger, bawdier side of the Good Book.

Being Catholic Now,Kerry Kennedy,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL15171065W,/authors/OL3067390A/Kerry_Kennedy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24302757M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Crown Publishing Group|Language English,"For Kerry Kennedy, who grew up in a devoutly Catholic household coping with great loss, her family's faith was a constant source of strength and solace. As an adult, she came to question some of the attitudes and teachings of the Catholic Church while remaining an impassioned believer in its role as a defender of the poor and oppressed.""Generations ago,"" says Kennedy, ""the search for spirituality came predefined and prepackaged. [The Church] not only gave us all the answers, it even gave us the questions to ask."" Now many of the old certainties are being reexamined. In an attempt to convey this sea change, Kennedy asked thirty-seven American Catholics to speak candidly about their own faith--whether lost, recovered, or deepened--and about their feelings regarding the way the Church hierarchy is moving forward.The voices included here range from respectful to reproachful and from appreciative to angry. Speaking their minds are businesspeople, actors and entertainers, educators, journalists, politicians, union leaders, nuns, priests--even a cardinal. Some love the Church; some feel intensely that the Church wronged them. All have an illuminating insight or perspective.Kerry Kennedy herself speaks of the joy of growing up as one of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's eleven children, of the tragedies that eventually befell her family, and of how religion was deeply woven through good times and bad. Journalist Andrew Sullivan talks about reconciling his devout Catholicism with the Church's condemnation of his identity as a gay man. TV newswoman Cokie Roberts recalls the nuns who taught her and ""took girls seriously when nobody else did."" Comedian Bill Maher declares, ""I hate religion. It's the worst thing in the world""--and goes on to defend his bold assertion. Writer Anna Quindlen depicts a common parental challenge: passing along traditions and values to a younger generation sometimes deaf to spiritual messages.Through these and many other voices that speak not only to Catholics but to all of us, Being Catholic Now redefines an ancient institution in the most contemporary of terms.From Being Catholic Now""When my mom asked if I wanted to be a nun, I said I'd rather be a priest. . . . The nuns were always wonderful, but the power was with the priest."" --Nancy Pelosi""There are aspects of studying the saints, with the candles, incense, and Latin Masses and some of the pageantry of the Church that, as an American historian, make me feel part of a larger wave of history. That it's not a newfangled religion, which some people get great solace from. I feel that I'm connected to places."" --Douglas Brinkley""Faith isn't like picking courses off a menu. It's a journey, and it's a path. If your path and journey have been within one structure your entire life, then simply leaving isn't an option."" --Andrew Sullivan""Why stay Catholic? Because the hierarchy is not the Church. . . .We [the people of God] are the Church. They can't take that away from us."" --Cokie Roberts""I was told very early on by the nuns that I had an 'overabundance of original sin.' I was a quiet kid, but I was curious. I asked the wrong questions."" --Susan Sarandon""I don't believe you can be authentically Catholic without being committed to the social doctrine of the Church. When I was in grammar school, we had these little boxes to help the poor. That was good, but that is half of it. The other half is to find out why there are so many poor people and how we can do something to help them."" --Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick ""I am reconciled to the oblivion that is coming.

In this strikingly concise book, he breaks down Christian life to its most basic elements--faith, hope, and love--and by examining these central commitments he provides one of the most accessible and direct introductions to Christianity and to his thought.The Handbook distills the essence of Christian belief and, whether read for spiritual growth or for its intellectual significance, shows the power of Augustine's mind and the clarity of his prose. Augustine writes with an unmatched range, drawing from classical scholarship, Christian scripture, and his own experiences to address the key issues in Christian faith, including the creation of the world, evil, original sin, Jesus and the incarnation of God, justification, baptism, the Church, faith and works, salvation, and the destiny of man.Few have ever matched Augustine's grasp of what it means to view the world as a Christian. He presents a fully formed vision of Christianity in a clear and pastoral form that keeps the reader always engaged in the practical applications of faith and leaves little doubt as to why his work continues to be read and appreciated in the present day.

It turns out that many believers have been giving the wrong answer. It is not heaven.Award-winning author N. T. Wright outlines the present confusion about a Christian's future hope and shows how it is deeply intertwined with how we live today. Wright, who is one of today's premier Bible scholars, asserts that Christianity's most distinctive idea is bodily resurrection. He provides a magisterial defense for a literal resurrection of Jesus and shows how this became the cornerstone for the Christian community's hope in the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of the age. Wright then explores our expectation of ""new heavens and a new earth,"" revealing what happens to the dead until then and what will happen with the ""second coming"" of Jesus. For many, including many Christians, all this will come as a great surprise.Wright convincingly argues that what we believe about life after death directly affects what we believe about life before death. For if God intends to renew the whole creation—;and if this has already begun in Jesus's resurrection—;the church cannot stop at ""saving souls"" but must anticipate the eventual renewal by working for God's kingdom in the wider world, bringing healing and hope in the present life.Lively and accessible, this book will surprise and excite all who are interested in the meaning of life, not only after death but before it.

One side demands that only their true religion be allowed in public; the other insists that no religions ever belong there. As the two sides slug it out, the stakes are rising. An ever-growing assortment of faiths insist on an ever-wider variety of truths. How can we possibly all live together and keep both the peace and our integrity (not to mention our sanity)? How can we end the war without surrendering our principles? The Right to Be Wrong draws its lessons from a series of stories—some old, others recent, some funny, others not. They tell of heroes and scoundrels, of riots, rabbis and reverends, Founders and flakes, from the colonial period to the present. The book concludes that freedom for all of us is guaranteed by the truth about each of us: Our common humanity entitles us to freedom—within broad limits—to follow what we believe to be true as our consciences say we must, even if our consciences are mistaken. Thus, we can respect others’ freedom when we’re sure they’re wrong. In truth, they have the right to be wrong.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Racing Toward Armageddon,Michael Baigent,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL15169508W,/authors/OL6812025A/Michael_Baigent,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24301192M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  HarperCollins|Language English,"Will current generations live to see Armageddon?Are there really sinister forces at work, encouraging its imminent arrival? If so, who exactly are they?In his latest investigative book Michael Baigent takes us to the assembly hall of the UN, the boardrooms of major businesses and powerful lobbying groups, the cabinet meetings of world leaders, the ranches of cattle breeders, the churches of the faithful, and the narrow winding streets of modern Jerusalem, revealing to us the many diverse, public, and clandestine figures behind a perilous messianic agenda.By unveiling truly bizarre alliances, revisiting centuries-old ghostly events still haunting the birthplaces of religion, unraveling complex threads of history to discern the difference between myth and prophecy, and providing a thorough explication of the religious texts underlying all of this madness in the context of the times in which they were written, Baigent presents a very different view of the past, present, and future than that perpetuated by many loose interpretations of scripture.What are faith force multipliers? Which members of the U.S. military top brass have fought to employ them? Which world leader belongs to a secret messianic society called the Hojjatieh? What is the Chalcedon Foundation? And what is the correlation between its tenets, those of sharia law, and the fulfillment of end-time prophecies?The answers to these questions and others will intrigue, mystify, and enrage you, whether you're a person of faith or a staunch secularist. But the author's goal is not simply to shock the reader—it is to help diffuse the time bomb that has been set by the hard-liners of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the end, Baigent asks these questions to deliver an urgent message: that spiritual yearning is actually a deep and personal issue of awareness, one that can bring hope and tolerance to the world, rather than the self-superiority and control that are born of fear and conflict.

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you (Matthew 6:33). Jesus builds His Church, but He told us to seek the Kingdom of God. Because believers have lost the Kingdom mentality, the Church has wandered from fad to fad looking for contemporary relevancy. The Church has no identity or power to effect cultures because we have lost our understanding of the Kingdom. In this powerful turn-of-the-century classic, the Kingdom of God is clearly defined, and how it is implemented is biblically presented. In The Kingdom, believers will discover their real identity and will understand their mighty mission here on earth. With keen insight, author George Dana Boardman clarifies the Gospel of the Kingdom and helps you regain your footing as you seek to fulfill your destiny.

One reason is because so much of the adult Bible education material available continues to teach grown up people using the same images, cliches and westernized interpretation used to teach children. Jesus for Adults examines the motives and personalities of the people who interacted with Jesus. It is written not so much for people who have already formed their belief system and need no further discussion, but for people who desperately want to believe, but who cannot be satisfied with the easy ""Sunday School"" answers that contradict their experience and understanding of the world and humanity.It also addresses a more fundamental question—why believe anything?

Soloveitchik, the rabbi known as ""The Rav"" by his followers worldwide, was a leading authority on the meaning of Jewish law and prominent force in building bridges between traditional Orthodox Judaism and the modern world. In THE LONELY MAN OF FAITH, a soaring, eloquent essay first published in Tradition magazine in 1965, Soloveitchik investigates the essential loneliness of the person of faith in our narcissistic, materially oriented, utilitarian society. In this modern classic, Soloveitchik uses the story of Adam and Eve as a springboard, interweaving insights from such important Western philosophers as Kierkegaard and Kant with innovative readings of Genesis to provide guidance for the faithful in today's world. He explains prayer as ""the harbinger of moral reformation,"" and discusses with empathy and understanding the despair and exasperation of individuals who seek personal redemption through direct knowledge of a God who seems remote and unapproachable. He shows that while the faithful may become members of a religious community, their true home is ""the abode of loneliness."" In a moving personal testimony, Soloveitchik demonstrates a deep-seated commitment, intellectual courage, and integrity that people of all religions will respond to.

These selections have been chosen singularly and as a group by John Marks Templeton, not only for their individual aesthetic beauty, but also to assist us in learning various lessons of life. The collection begins with prayer, drawn from sources such as Celtic, Native American, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions, among others. These words are used to help the reader understand the power of prayer and how it can best be used as a conduit for God’s love and wisdom. The next section combines hymns, spiritual songs, and contemporary tunes into a ministry of music. There are some classic favorites as well as ones from Hindu worship, Filipino folk songs, Kwanzaa celebrations, and the Buddhist tradition. Combining uplifting words with music carries feelings directly to the heart, and many of these selections have the accompanying musical scores included to add to one’s enjoyment. Both the imagery and construction of poetry included in the next section convey powerful feelings and can open the heart to the elegance of language and the richness of the spirit. Among the selections are Walt Whitman and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow along with contemporary writers Ken Wilber and Jack Kornfield. Navajo prayers are juxtaposed to Kahil Gibran and Hildegard of Bingen. From this rich mixture of prayer, song, and poetry comes a confirmation of the life-affirming universality of the human spirit. Together these works celebrate the universal principles found in the human mind, and attempt to bridge the gaps between religions, cultures, and peoples of the world.

Written by twenty-four leading scholars from the fields of religious studies, American history and literature, philosophy, art history, sociology, and musicology, the book adopts an inclusive perspective on Jewish religious experience. Three initial chapters cover the development of Judaism in America from 1654, when Sephardic Jews first landed in New Amsterdam, until today. Subsequent chapters include cutting-edge scholarship and original ideas while remaining accessible at an introductory level. A secondary goal of this volume is to help its readers better understand the more abstract term of 'religion' in a Jewish context. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism will be of interest not only to scholars but also to all readers interested in social and intellectual trends in the modern world.

At age thirty-eight, Cootsona, a physically fit minister busy with his growing congregation and his young family, had a scare with heart trouble. The unexpected and frightening news proved providential. Cootsona realized that he was juggling too many roles, saying yes to too many commitments. In SAY YES TO NO, Cootsona blends personal experiences and deep reflection to show why learning to say no can transform our lives. He describes the choices he made as he set the priorities in his own life, and encourages readers to look within their hearts and focus on the values and the goals that promise them their greatest rewards. Filled with sound advice and profound insights, SAY YES TO NO provides a path to achieving physical, professional, emotional, and spiritual well-being that will appeal to Christian and mainstream audiences alike.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Religion and Nationalism in Chinese Societies,Cheng-tian Kuo,religion,,/works/OL20930717W,/authors/OL9606687A/Cheng-tian_Kuo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Amsterdam University Press|Language English,"Religion and Nationalism in Chinese Societies explores the interaction between religion and nationalism in the Chinese societies of mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. On the one hand, state policies toward religions in these societies are deciphered and their implications for religious freedom and regional stability are evaluated. On the other hand, Chinese Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, Daoism, Christianity, Islam and folk religions are respectively analyzed in terms of their theological, organizational and political responses to the nationalist modernity projects of these states. What is new in this book on Religion and Nationalism in Chinese Societies is that the Chinese state has strengthened its control over religion to an unprecedented level. In particular, the Chinese state has almost completed its construction of a state religion called Chinese Patriotism. But at the same time, what is also new is the emergence of democratic civil religions in these Chinese societies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

No wonder so many followers of Christ are unsure of what they really believe in the face of the new spiritual openness attempting to alter unchanging truth.For centuries the church has taught and guarded the core Christian beliefs that make up the essential foundations of the faith. But in our postmodern age, sloppy teaching and outright lies create rampant confusion, and many Christians are free-falling for ""feel-good"" theology.  We need to know the truth to save ourselves from errors that will derail our faith.  As biblical scholar, author, and president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dr. Albert Mohler, writes, ""The entire structure of Christian truth is now under attack."" With wit and wisdom he tackles the most important aspects of these modern issues: Is God changing His mind about sin?Why is hell off limits for many pastors?What's good or bad about the ""dangerous"" emergent movement? Have Christians stopped seeing God as God?Is the social justice movement misguided?Could the role of beauty be critical to our theology?Is liberal faith any less destructive than atheism?Are churches pandering to their members to survive?In the age-old battle to preserve the foundations of faith, it's up to a new generation to confront and disarm the contemporary shams and fight for the truth. Dr. Mohler provides the scriptural answers to show you how.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book argues that fundamentalism develops when modern lay religious leaders challenge the authority of secular states and traditional religious establishments. These new leaders and their followers seek to infuse religious values and practices into all spheres, especially law, politics, education, and science. The patterns of religious authority and leadership that characterize fundamentalism have their roots in a Christian context but were globalized through intense intercultural contacts after the mid-nineteenth century. Fundamentalism is a thoroughly modern and global phenomenon because it presupposes the globalization of ideas and practices concerning religious leadership and organization, as well as universal changes in the relationship of religion to modern societies and states""--Provided by publisher.

The question arises with regards to efficient concepts or tools which will help to shape the encounter of the different religions and cultures of the world with one another. Indicative here is the cognition that hospitality has to do with a factor which is proven in almost all religions and cultures of the world. Hospitality is primarily an existential encounter and as such it brings also the experience of difference in socio-religious traditions and in intercultural relations.

Coakley asks whether it is a coincidence that at the same time, philosophers of religion have tended to be in notable retreat from bold public claims about the rationality of Christian truth. In contrast to this double trend, and in riposte to the 'New Atheism' of the secularists, Coakley argues that the most recent deliveries from evolutionary biology augur a vision of sacrifice which is both rationally defensible and biologically grounded. Evolutionary dynamics, religious practice and hermeneutics, and new arguments for the rationality of belief belong together; and this nexus of themes demands the closest attention as the world confronts the profoundest ecological crisis it has yet known""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It develops a contextual account of Schopenhauer's relation to the religions of India by placing his interpretation of their main doctrines within the perspective of his diagnosis of the religious situation in nineteenth-century Europe, and his revised conception of the proper content and methods of metaphysical philosophy in the wake of Kant. It shows that Schopenhauer's encounter with the religions of India was the stimulus for his formulation of a novel theory of a revitalised modern Christianity. The possibility of an oriental renaissance prompted Schopenhauer to argue that Christianity's immanent or ethical teachings needed to be severed from its supernatural or metaphysical doctrines, so that European culture could continue to satisfy the human need for a metaphysical interpretation of the world and life""--P.

The study of religion in an age of global dialogue,Leonard J Swidler,religion,First published in 2000,/works/OL11999267W,/authors/OL5176353A/Leonard_J_Swidler,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16988627M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2000|Publisher  Temple University Press|Language English|Pages 229,"Religion is the most fundamental, comprehensive of all human activities. It tries to make sense out of not simply one or another aspect of human life, but of all aspects of human experience. At the core of every civilization lies its religion, which both reflects and shapes it. Thus, if we wish to understand human life in general and our specific culture and history, we need to understand religion.What is religion? Religion is an explanation of the ultimate meaning of life, and how to live accordingly; based on a notion of the Transcendent. Normally it contains the four 'C's': Creed, Code, Cult, Community-structure. Creed refers to the cognitive aspect of a religion; it is everything that goes into the 'explanation' of the ultimate meaning of life. Code of Behavior, or ethics, includes all the rules and customs of action that somehow follow from one aspect or another of the Creed. Cult means all the ritual activities that relate the follower to one aspect or another of the Transcendent, either directly or indirectly, prayer being an example of the former and certain formal behavior toward representatives of the Transcendent, such as priests, of the latter.Community-Structure refers to the relationships among the followers; this can vary widely, from a very egalitarian relationship, as among Quakers, through a 'republican' structure as Presbyterians have, to a monarchical one, as with some Hasidic Jews have with their Rebbe. The Transcendent, as the roots of the word indicate, means 'that which goes beyond' the everyday, the ordinary, the surface experience of reality. It can mean spirits, gods, a Personal God, an Impersonal God, Emptiness, etc.This volume looks at the ways we humans have developed to study religion. However, a new age in human consciousness is now dawning: The Age of Global Dialogue, a radically new consciousness which fundamentally shifts the ways we understand everything in life, including religion. This global dialogical way of understanding life does not lead to one global religion, but it does lead toward a consciously acknowledged common set of ethical principles, a Global Ethic. The book looks at these two movements the Age of Global Dialogue and inchoative Global Ethic in order to help readers understand what is going on around them, so they might make informed, intelligent decisions about the meaning of life and how to live it.

Embers is perhaps Richard Wagamese's most personal volume to date. Honest, evocative and articulate, he explores the various manifestations of grief, joy, recovery, beauty, gratitude, physicality and spirituality--concepts many find hard to express. But for Wagamese, spirituality is multifaceted. Within these pages, readers will find hard-won and concrete wisdom on how to feel the joy in the everyday things. Wagamese does not seek to be a teacher or guru, but these observations made along his own journey to become, as he says, ""a spiritual bad-ass,"" make inspiring reading.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ireland's immortals,M. A.

The first account of the gods of Irish myth to take in the whole sweep of Irish literature in both the nation's languages, the book describes how Ireland's pagan divinities were transformed into literary characters in the medieval Christian era--and how they were recast again during the Celtic Revival of the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A lively narrative of supernatural beings and their fascinating and sometimes bizarre stories, Mark Williams's comprehensive history traces how these gods - known as the Tuatha De Danann - have shifted shape across the centuries, from Iron Age cult to medieval saga to today's young-adult fiction. We meet the heroic Lug; the Morrigan, crow goddess of battle; the fire goddess Brigit, who moonlights as a Christian saint; the mist-cloaked sea god Manannan mac Lir; and the ageless fairies who inspired J.R.R. Tolkien's immortal elves. Medieval clerics speculated that the Irish divinities might be devils, angels, or enchanters. W. B. Yeats invoked them to reimagine the national condition, while his friend George Russell beheld them in visions and understood them to be local versions of Hindu deities. The book also tells how the Scots repackaged Ireland's divine beings as the gods of the Gael on both sides of the sea--and how Irish mythology continues to influence popular culture far beyond Ireland.

She shows that the Minoan religion is similar to Egyptian and Near Eastern religions in its concentration on death and rebirth, divine sacred marriage, and nature imagery emphasizing cyclical renewal but maintains its distinctiveness in social and ritual organization. She views religious change in combination with historical and social change, beginning her analysis before the advent of the palaces--which she regards as temples--and concluding in the postpalatial period.

This question animated the lives and labors of the common men—and occasionally women—who made a living as alchemists in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Holy Roman Empire. As purveyors of practical techniques, inventions, and cures, these entrepreneurs were prized by princely patrons, who relied upon alchemists to bolster their political fortunes. At the same time, satirists, artists, and other commentators used the figure of the alchemist as a symbol for Europe’s social and economic ills.Drawing on criminal trial records, contracts, laboratory inventories, satires, and vernacular alchemical treatises, Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire situates the everyday alchemists, largely invisible to modern scholars until now, at the center of the development of early modern science and commerce. Reconstructing the workaday world of entrepreneurial alchemists, Tara Nummedal shows how allegations of fraud shaped their practices and prospects. These debates not only reveal enormously diverse understandings of what the ""real"" alchemy was and who could practice it; they also connect a set of little-known practitioners to the largest questions about commerce, trust, and intellectual authority in early modern Europe.

American evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholicshave hated and suspected one another since colonial times. In the twentieth century, however, each community has experienced radical change, and this has led to a change in the relationship between the two. In this book William Shea examines the history of this troubled relationship and the signs of potential reconciliation. His springboard is the recent publicity given to the 1993 document Evangelicals and Catholics Together, in which several well-known figures from each camp, acting as individuals,signed a statement affirming much more common theological and social ground than any other American Catholic-evangelical group had ever done...

How the other half worships,Camilo J.

It is hard not to be impressed by the standard of living in the nation's most affluent suburban and urban neighborhoods. Yet, scattered amid stretches that abound in wealth, the country is home to neighborhoods rife with violence, poverty, segregation, and decay. Within these blighted urban landscapes, however, there is at least one notable example of plenty: churches. They do not always appear as traditional houses of worship, but often emerge from the retrofitted shells of former storefronts, garages, factories, warehouses, domestic dwellings, and public institutions. Regardless of the façade, churches riddle America's poorest neighborhoods. Bringing together more than 300 stunning color photographs and a series of candid interviews with pastors, church officials, and congregation members, this extraordinary book explores the conditions, beliefs, and practices that shape the churches and the lives of the nation's urban poor. Over a period of thirty years, sociologist and photographer Camilo José Vergara repeatedly visited these places of worship and the eclectic mix of buildings that house them. In twenty-one cities located in ten states across the country, photographic sequences coupled with insightful narrative show how ordinary structures assume, modify, and shed a religious character, how traditional churches -- if they fail to adapt to new congregations -- are demolished, and how new churches are designed and built from the ground up. Vergara pays special attention to the objects, texts, and imagery that religious leaders make use of to create environments that inspire devotion. Pastors ofdeveloping congregations often arrive as crusaders, with missions that cannot be served by traditional religious iconography, and with budgets that force them to use inexpensive materials. In some cases, pastors bring objects of worship from their home towns in places such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Africa, and the West Indies. Despite the idiosyncratic features and folk decoration that distinguish ghetto churches from one another, however, Vergara shows that, for the most part, they are driven by similar religious agendas. They tend to preach about resilience, avoid involving themselves in national and international events, and consider their truths to be absolute and eternal. A powerful, poignant, and visually arresting portrait, How the Other Half Worships stands as a stark witness to how churches are being rebuilt in the dilapidated streets of America's cities and how religion is being reinvented by the nation's poor. - Publisher.

Whether those Muslims are villagers in Iraq or neighbors down the street, Breaking the Islam Code offers everyday Christians profound insight into the way Muslims think and feel. J.D. Greear's ability to communicate challenging heart truth, plus his expertise in Christian and Islamic theology and two years' experience in a Muslim-dominated area, make him the perfect author for this empowering, insightful, reader-friendly book. It transcends traditional apologetics, focusing on helping Christians: understand what is deep in Muslims' hearts, behind their theology—which will lead to friendship and effective communication of the gospel; respectfully turn many of the primary objections into opportunities to share the faith; avoid unnecessarily offending Muslims they're interacting with. Readers will be excited that sharing Christ with Muslims is something they can do—as everyday Christians in their own cities, campuses, and workplaces. - Publisher.

Although the empire has been commonly viewed as a Hindu bulwark against Islamic incursion from the north or as a religiously ecumenical state, Valerie Stoker argues that the Vijayanagara court was selective in its patronage of religious institutions. To understand the dynamic interaction between religious and royal institutions in this period, she focuses on the career of the Hindu intellectual and monastic leader Vy?sat?rtha. An agent of the state and a powerful religious authority, Vy?sat?rtha played an important role in expanding the empire?s economic and social networks. By examining his polemics against rival sects in the context of his work for the empire, Stoker provides a remarkably nuanced picture of the relationship between religious identity and sociopolitical reality under Vijayanagara rule.

Much has been written on problems of evil, but the matter of divine severity has received relatively little attention. Paul K. Moser discusses the function of philosophy, evidence and miracles in approaching God. He argues that if God's aim is to extend without coercion His lasting life to humans, then commitment to that goal could manifest itself in making human life severe, for the sake of encouraging humans to enter into that cooperative good life. In this scenario, divine agapé is conferred as free gift, but the human reception of it includes stress and struggle in the face of conflicting powers and priorities. Moser's work will be of great interest to students of the philosophy of religion, and theology""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sometimes these messages are relayed by very convincing images or visuals, while other times they come as voices, slight touches and even written notes. Messages from the ""other side"" are often thoughts of comfort and tranquility, and often evidence that someone is still watching over us. True Stories of Messages From Beyond tells 14 different stories of the bond we all share with those we love...a bond never broken...not even by death. Each story was written by an ordinary person living an ordinary life...who was touched, changed, comforted, and even transformed by their own unique extraordinary encounters with those they love on the other side.

This church developed from the initiative of a Chinese Indonesian businessman by the name of Tee Siem Tat, who seeking someone to baptize him and his newly believing associates, found Russian Mennonite missionaries of the Dutch Mennonite Mission working in the region who agreed to baptize them. The first baptisms occurred in December 1920. The church was organized and registered with the government by 1926. After forty years as an almost exclusively Chinese Indonesian church, they called a Javanese minister from the neighboring Javanese Mennonite Church (GITJ) and soon began to share their faith with Javanese people and eventually people of other ethnic groups as well. The church now has congregations in Central, West and East Java, Bali, northern and southern Sumatra, Kalimantan (Borneo) and several smaller islands.

Pornography infiltrates nearly every home. Homosexuality is accepted. Lust has been redefined. The family as an institution is questioned.We are reminded every day that assumptions about what is right and wrong, sexually, are different today than they were fifty--or even ten--years ago. Christian principles that formed the pattern for generations of American families are conspicuously absent. What happened and why? How do we respond to the dramatic shift in our culture's perspective on sex? As one of today's most influential thinkers, Dr. Albert Mohler addresses these critical topics in a thoughtful, cut-to-the-chase style in Desire and Deceit. As you follow Mohler's guidance in applying biblical solutions to today's most highly charged issues, you will be not only equipped but also inspired to speak the truth in a society hungry for answers.From the Hardcover edition.

History, literature, theology and the dynamic of a living, worldwide religious reality, all appropriately impinge on the study of Jesus. The two parts of the book roughly correspond to the interdependent tasks of historical description and critical and theological reflection. It incorporates the most up-to-date historical work on Jesus the Jew with the 'bigger issues' of critical method, the story of Christian faith and study, and Jesus in a global church and in the encounter with Judaism and Islam. Written by seventeen leading international scholars, the book encourages students of the historical Jesus to discover the vital contribution of theology, and students of doctrine to engage the Christ of faith as Jesus the first-century Jew.

Designed to elevate our lives above mere frantic, animal existence to the sublime levels humanity is capable or experiencing, they are the blueprint of God's expectations of us and His plan for a meaningful, just, loving, and holy life. Each commandment asserts a principle, and each principle is a moral focal point for real-life issues relating to God, family, sex, work, charity, property, speech, and thought. Written in collaboration with Rabbi Stewart Vogel,  The Ten Commandments  incorporates lively discussion of the Bible and the Judeo-Christian values derived from it. Filled with passion, emotion, and profound insights, it will move, enlighten, inspire, entertain, and educate you on the meaning each commandment has in our daily lives today: I am the Lord, your God, Who has taken you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. You shall not recognize the gods of others in My presence.You shall not take the Name of the Lord., your God, in vain.Remember the Sabbath day and sanctify it.Honor your Father and your Mother.You shall not murder.

'Ethiopia bred in me the conviction that if there is a wider purpose to our life, it is to understand the world, to seek out its diversity, to celebrate its heroes and its wonders - in short, to witness it.' When Philip Marsden first went to Ethiopia in 1982, it changed the direction of his life. What he saw of its stunning antiquity, its raw Christianity, its extremes of brutality and grace prompted his curiosity, and made him a writer. But Ethiopia at that time was torn apart by civil war. The north, the ancient heartland of the country, was closed off. Twenty years later, Marsden returned. The result is this book - the account of a journey deferred. Walking hundreds of miles through a landscape of cavernous gorges, tabletop mountains and semi-desert, Marsden encounters monks and hermits, rebels and farmers. And he creates an unforgettable picture of one of the most remote regions left on earth. As in his award-winning book 'The Spirit-Wrestlers', Marsden reminds us of the brilliant heights that travel writing can attain, whilst celebrating the ageless rewards of the open road and the people for whom the mythic and the everyday are inextricably joined.""--Amazon website.

Seeing compassion in this way, we lose out on experiencing the transformative potential of one of our most neglected inner resources.Dr Lorne Ladner rescues compassion from this marginalised view, showing how its practical application in our life can be a powerful force in achieving happiness. Combining the wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism and Western psychology, Ladner presents clear, effective practices for cultivating compassion in daily living.

"Words of gratitude for mind, body, and soul",Robert A. Emmons,religion,First published in 2001,/works/OL6213698W?edition=ia%3Awordsgratitudefo00emmo,/authors/OL1603955A/Robert_A._Emmons,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24259467M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  Templeton Foundation Press|Language English,"""Everything is, is freely given by the God of love. All is grace. Light and water, shelter and food, work and free time, children, parents, grandparents, life and death— it is all given to us. Why? So that we can say thanks; thanks to God, thanks to each other, thanks to all and everyone.” —Henri NouwenLearning how to experience gratitude involves being grateful as a attitude, not as a reaction when good things occur. One does not need to wait until things are perfect before being grateful; in fact, it may be just the opposite. It could be that the act of being grateful, in itself, makes one receptive to life’s blessings, and these blessings continue as we continue to be thankful.Various levels of gratitude and their importance to well-being are areas that author Robert Emmons, professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, has chosen to study and document. He has collected the thoughts of philosophers, theologians, and writers on the topic to illustrate the age-old process of giving thanks. He draws from various religions to show that gratitude is not exclusive to any one tradition, but might be a quality common to all.The study of gratitude is one that looks at moral barometers, emotions, and the effect this feeling has on health and happiness. In fact, G. K. Chesterton said, “The test of all happiness is gratitude.” Emmons draws from gratitude research projects that followed participants who were randomly selected to write down either the things they were grateful for or items of complaint over a period of ten weeks. The study showed that gratitude led to more positive emotional states and inspired people to be more helpful to others.The act of gratitude is one that provides gifts to the giver and receiver. The illuminating words of this book will inspire readers to recognize how truly blessed we are. This has been beautifully stated by the words of Brother David Steindl-Rast, “Love wholeheartedly, be surprised, give thanks and praise—then you will discover the fullness of your life.”HighlightsInspiring words on thankfulness from theologians, scientists, and writers Explanation of the importance of gratitude and the barriers to this process An overview of research that shows positive benefits of gratitude   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Smith's lifelong spiritual journey brought him face-to-face with many of the people who shaped the twentieth century. His extraordinary travels around the globe have taken him to the world's holiest places, where he has practiced religion with many of the great spiritual leaders of our time.Smith's life is a story of uncanny synchronicity. He was there for pivotal moments in human history such as the founding of the United Nations and the student uprising at Tiananmen Square. As he traveled the world he encountered thinkers who shaped the twentieth century. He interviewed Eleanor Roosevelt on the radio; invited Martin Luther King Jr. to speak at an all-white university before the March on Washington; shared ideas with Thomas Merton on his last plane ride before Merton's death in Bangkok; and was rescued while lost in the Serengeti by Masai warriors who took him to the compound of world-renowned anthropologists Louis and Mary Leaky.In search of intellectual and spiritual treasures, Smith traveled to India to meet with Mother Teresa and befriended the Dalai Lama; he studied Zen at the most challenging monastery in Japan; and he hitchhiked through the desert to meet Aldous Huxley, dropped acid with Timothy Leary, and took peyote with a Native American shaman. He climbed Mount Athos, traipsed through the Holy Land, and was the first to study multiphonic chanting by monks in Tibet, which he recorded with Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead. Most important, he shared the world's religions with the West—writing two bestselling books and serving as the focus of a five-part PBS television series by Bill Moyers.Huston Smith is a national treasure. His life is an extraordinary adventure, and in his amazing Tales of Wonder, he invites you to come along to explore your own vistas of heart, mind, and soul.

We desperately need to downsize, reprioritize, and sometimes even sacrifice less important things in order to simplify our lives. In doing so, we become unfettered enough to see more clearly where our priorities should lie.We have the tendency to seek temporary satisfaction through a more convenient or more accommodating value system. We settle on whatever gives us permission to do what we want and to acquire what we desire. Ruth possessed the virtues of wisdom, faith, and trust; and employing these while enduring personal crisis, she realized that the very things she needed for inner strength and support were her family traditions. What we find on this journey is that these foundational tenets lead us down a path to a place of peace and contentment, to the Things that Really Matter.

He became known in the United States after he began founding meditation centers here in 1980. Now in his late seventies, he tells the remarkable story of his life and spiritual education in Footprints in the Snow.

In most forms of meditation, the meditator is instructed to let go of thoughts as they arise. As a result, thinking is often taken, unnecessarily, to be something misguided or evil. This approach is misguided, says Jason Siff. In fact, if we allow thoughts to arise and become mindful of the thoughts themselves, we gain tranquillity and insight just as in other methods without having to reject our natural mental processes. And by observing the thoughts themselves with mindfulness and curiosity, we can learn a good deal about ourselves in the process""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While the branch of Methodism led by John Wesley has received significant historical attention, Calvinistic Methodism, especially in England, has not. This book charts the sources of the eighteenth-century Methodist revival in the context of Protestant evangelicalism emerging in continental Europe and colonial North America, before proceeding to follow the fortunes in both England and Wales of the Calvinistic branch, to the establishing of formal denominations in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries.""--Page 4 of cover.

Other issues discussed in this segment relate to the interrelationships that exist between academic theology, ecumenism, and Christianity.

The third segment of the book treats Religion and Cultural Practices in African and how all these work out in couching out an African theology and African Christianity. Some of the issues discussed in this section related to African traditional philosophy, spiritism, and the interrelationships that exist between African Christianity and African Traditional Religion.0The last segment of the book discusses the issue of African biblical hermeneutics and specifically looks at contemporary hermeneutical approaches to biblical interpretations in Africa.

S. Lewis said that Christianity works on us like every other myth, except it is a myth that really happened. Dwight Longenecker grabs this idea and runs with it, showing that the Christian story is the greatest story ever told because it gathers up what is true in all the fantasy stories of the world and makes them as solid, true, and real as a tribe of dusty nomads in the desert or the death of a carpenter-king.  In The Romance of Religion Longenecker calls for the return of the romantic hero—the hero who knows his frailty and can fight the good fight with panache, humor, and courage. Conflict and romance are everywhere in the story of Christ, and our response is to dust off our armor, don our broad-brimmed hats, pick up our swords, and do battle for Christ with confidence, wonder, and joy.  Is religion no more than a fairy tale? No, it is more than a fairy tale—much more: it is all the fairy tales and fantastic stories come true here and now.

Drei Thesen werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit formuliert und anhand von führenden Theoretikern und Dichtern der Zeit (Nietzsche, Mauthner, Kassner, Heinrich Mann, Musil, Rilke, Hauptmann, Hofmannsthal, Altenberg u. a.) belegt.  Die Welt sei dem Menschen und seiner Erkenntnis nicht (mehr) zugänglich. Diese Überzeugung betrifft insbesondere die Möglichkeiten, die man der Sprache und den Wissenschaften zutraut. Diese Verunsicherung führt zu einer nachhaltigen Erkenntnis- und Sprachskepsis.  Neue geistige Strömungen (Monismus, Lebensphilosophie) ersetzen alte Religiosität und bilden den bewußtseinsgeschichtlichen Rahmmen für das Phänomen »Neomystik«, in der die imaginierte oder erlebte Einheit der traditionellen Mystik mit Gott auf die entgöttlichte Weit bezogen wird. So soll dem verunsichernden Gefühl der Entfremdung von der Welt begegnet werden.  Diese Mystik bedarf – wie die alte Mystik – eines besonderen sprachlichen Ausdrucks und ist daher eng mit literarästhetischen Überlegungen verknüpft und wird Ihrerseits selbst zum Thema von Literatur.

Written for anyone longing for a more generative and loving God, this book offers a new paradigm through which  faith can be understood. This boundary-breaking God engages life at every corner-social, economical, political, intellectual, ecological. Offers a refreshing view of God that is creative and expansive.    Written by the popular pastor of Journey Community Church in Dallas, this fresh vision of who God can be is enlivened by winsome personal stories and anecdotes.  Seeing God's story as a story of boundary breaking opens our imaginations and compels Christians to live as people of hopeful purpose who attempt to change the world for the better.  Opens up the Christian ""good news"" for those who are  tired of the same old, same old   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism,Catherine Wessinger,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16540907W?edition=ia%3Aoxfordhandbookof0000unse_h9t3,/authors/OL2849125A/Catherine_Wessinger,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25231393M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Oxford,              Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 768","Christian Dispensationalism, the Taiping Revolution, cargo cults in Oceania, the Baha'i Faith, and the Raelian Movement would seem to have little in common. What they share, however, is a millennial orientation-the audacious human hope for a collective salvation, which may be heavenly or earthly or both. Although many religions feature a belief in personal salvation, millennial faiths are characterized by the expectation that salvation will be accomplished for an entire group by a superhuman agent, with or without human collaboration. The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism offers readers an in-depth look at both the theoretical underpinnings of the study of millennialism and its many manifestations across history and cultures. While the term ""millennialism"" is drawn from Christianity, it is a category that is used to study religious expressions in diverse cultures, religious traditions, and historical periods. Sometimes, millennial expectations are expressed in peaceful ways. Other times, millennialists become involved in violence. The Oxford Handbook of Millennialism begins with a section that examines four primary types of millennialism. Chapters in the next section examine key issues such as charismatic leadership, use of scripture, prophetic failure, gender roles, children, tension with society, and violence. The rest of the book explores millennialism in a wide variety of places and times, from ancient Near Eastern movements to contemporary apocalyptic and new age movements, including the roles played by millennialism in national and international conflicts. This handbook will be a valuable resource for scholars of religious studies, sociology, psychology, history, and new religious movements. - Publisher.

"Wisdom, science, and the Scriptures",Stephen Finamore,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL22939297W,/authors/OL8721423A/Stephen_Finamore,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL30846540M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Pickwick Publications|Language English|Pages 264,"""This collection of essays is offered in admiration of and in gratitude for the work of Ernest Charles Lucas. The title of the volume acknowledges Ernest's particular areas of interest and expertise. The word wisdom comes first for two reasons: firstly because the Bible's Wisdom literature is a particular love about which Ernest has published a number of books, and secondly because wisdom is a characteristic of the man. Several of the contributions to this volume pick up the theme of biblical wisdom, while others touch on the practical application of a wisdom shaped by the Scriptures to vital contemporary issues. The second word of the title, science, reflects both Ernest's first career as a research bio-chemist and his interest as a theologian in exploring the relationship between science and faith. This area of interest is reflected in a number of the contributions to this collection, including Ernest's passionate interest in and concern about climate change. The final words of the title are and the Scriptures. Ernest has, at one time or another, taught every part of the Bible and retained a keen interest in the discipline of Biblical Studies. Once again, this is reflected in some of the contributions. There are other aspects to Ernest Lucas and among them is a love of sport, especially cricket. And so the collection ends with a reflection on this wonderful pastime."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We are overwhelmed.  Does the security and peace that should come from knowing we are in the hands of a loving God now seem to be an empty promise?  Perhaps that's because we have built our foundation on someone else's faith -- parents', friend's, or pastor's, so we merely inherit a relationship with Jesus, but never find our own.    A true storyteller and a teacher with a heart for ministry, Mark Hall traces the tragic, downward spiral that leads to a life of fear and spiritual compromise, and then charts the hopeful, upward road to the joy and confidence that comes when we claim our very own Jesus.   Through fascinating personal stories, scriptural insights, and practical interactive studies, Your Own Jesus will liberate readers from compromise and empower them with joy and confidence.

Some doors, you don't want to find out what lies behind them. In the Forbidden Doors series by bestselling author Bill Myers, teenager Rebecca 'Becka' Williams, her younger brother Scott, and her friend Ryan Riordan are swept into heart-stopping encounters with an all-too-real invisible world---a world fraught with deception and spiritual adversaries that promise goodness and enlightenment but will stop at nothing to destroy life, sanity, and human souls. Witchcraft. Reincarnation. Ouija Boards. UFOs. Shamanism. Counterfeit spiritualities are widespread and popular with spiritually searching young adults such as Becka's peers. What's the harm? Find out. Join Becka, Scott, and Ryan as they head for mind-bending clashes between the forces of darkness and the kingdom of God. Combining meticulous research, realistic settings, and masterful storytelling, the Forbidden Doors novels take you from the mountains of New Mexico to the inner workings of a secret society---and into the truth of God's Word, which exposes lies and reveals the reality of spiritual warfare. Each volume in the series contains three books that center around a particular kind of Forbidden Door. Book One: Dark Powers contains The Society, The Deceived, and The Spell; Book Two: Invisible Terror contains The Haunting, The Guardian, and The Encounter; Book Three: Deadly Loyalty contains The Curse, The Undead, and The Scream; Book Four: Ancient Forces contains The Ancients, The Wiccan, and The Cards   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pure Unlimited Love,Sir John Templeton,religion,First published in 2000,/works/OL8908392W?edition=ia%3Apureunlimitedlov00temp,/authors/OL3072148A/Sir_John_Templeton,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24264876M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  Templeton Foundation Press|Language English,"Understanding and expressing unconditional love—also called agape love—can be a lifelong quest. First, however, we must ask ourselves and others what it is. Is it an action, a universal energy, or a creative principle? And if we understand it, can its expression ever be realized or is it simply a divine attribute? These and other questions are addressed in an inspirational and practical style in this philosophical essay from Sir John Templeton. He seeks to define pure, unlimited love as the ""transcendent power of divine love that expresses itself through our hearts and minds when we are open and receptive to it."" Its greatest attributes are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control. Another important concept is that God’s love is given to us because we seek and accept it, not because we deserve it. It is the humble and sincere person who is most receptive to God’s perfect love. This love can be awakened in other people through the action of love itself. We learn what it is from those who have it, and we can begin to recognize it through loving service to others. Basic reality seems to be that the more you try to be like God by radiating unlimited love, the more you become flooded by waves of love from others and from God. Sir John summarizes with the statement ""How wonderful it would be if we could begin to say whenever we meet or depart, ‘God loves you and I do too.’"" This, in fact, is the essence of pure, unlimited love—a concept we can understand and can begin to practice in our daily lives. This thoughtful book can serve as an inspiration as well as a step-by-step guide on how to put this into practice. Highlights A thoughtful essay on unconditional love Conversion of a complex theological principle to practical actions A clear explanation of the power of love.

English Protestantism provided a vocabulary and structure to describe and maintain boundaries between insider and outsider. In this path-breaking study, Heather Miyano Kopelson peels back the layers of conflicting definitions of bodies and competing practices of faith in the Puritan Atlantic, demonstrating how the categories of 'white,' 'black,' and 'Indian' developed alongside religious boundaries between 'Christian' and 'heathen' and between 'Catholic' and 'Protestant.' Faithful Bodies focuses on three communities of Protestant dissent in the Atlantic World: Bermuda, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. In this 'Puritan Atlantic,' religion determined insider and outsider status: at times Africans and Natives could belong as long as they embraced the Protestant faith, while Irish Catholics and English Quakers remained suspect. Colonists' interactions with indigenous peoples of the Americas and with West Central Africans shaped their understandings of human difference and its acceptable boundaries. Prayer, religious instruction, sexual behavior, and other public and private acts became markers of whether or not Blacks and Indians were sinning Christians or godless heathens. As slavery became law, transgressing people of color counted less and less as sinners in English Puritans' eyes, even as some of them made Christianity an integral part of their communities. As Kopelson shows, this transformation proceeded unevenly but inexorably during the long seventeenth century""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Assertive Religion,,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL32327779W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English|Pages 223,"""Questions about religions and religious institutions have changed dramatically since they first arose many years ago. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, the link of religion with extreme ideologies captures our attention. Such questions have been the focus of a steadily growing number of books. What does Assertive Religion add to the debate?Emanuel de Kadt discusses the relationship of religion to wider social issues such as human rights and multiculturalism. He traces the growth, during the religious revival over the past decades, of assertive, and even coercive, forms of religion, notably--but not exclusively--fundamentalist varieties. He deals with these questions as they relate to the three major Abrahamic religions, thereby addressing a readership wider than that made up of persons interested exclusively in Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. The author takes on issues such as the effects of the ""Jewishness"" of Israel on the rights of Palestinians; the consequences of the centralized authority structure of the Roman Catholic Church; and the implications of the failure of reform-oriented Muslims to make their voices heard in an organized Islamic reform movement. He is even-handed, focusing on both positive and negative features of each religious perspective, though he does have a clear viewpoint. Assertive Religion adds to increasingly sharp political discussions on issues arising out of religion. It is a must read for anyone interested in how religion is shaping the world of tomorrow.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By now, we've all heard someone say, ""It must have been his karma"" or ""She had bad karma."" But what is karma, really? Does karmic theory say that we are helpless victims of our past? Is all karma bad, or can there be good karma too? Is reincarnation the same as the Buddhist theory of rebirth? In this short and eminently readable book, Traleg Kyabgon answers these questions and more by elucidating the Buddha's teachings on karma and rebirth. He distinguishes the Buddhist view of karma and rebirth from related notions of karma and reincarnation found in the Hindu tradition, explains why the notion of karma is indispensable to the theory and practice of Buddhism, and demonstrates how karmic theory provides a foundation for morality that doesn't require belief in God. Throughout he shows how to work with karma intelligently to bring about beneficial changes in the way we relate to our thoughts, feelings, and circumstances""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here the method used is primarily sociological. Throughout this study the realities of both home and host countries that have affected them are taken into consideration in analysing the shifting identities of this ethnic community.  In the first introductory chapter the scope of study is described, with the methodology of research. The second chapter explains the theoretical framework created in relation to five general principles presented by R. Stephen Warner in his research on various ethno-religious immigrant communities in the United States of America. This is presented in the context of other similar research. The third chapter gives a descriptive picture of the lives of immigrants attending five Sri Lankan Buddhist temples and three Sri Lankan Christian Associations in London where Sinhala people from Sri Lanka are involved.  Critical analysis begins in the fourth chapter with the effects of religious beliefs and attitudes during the immigration of this ethnic group. A scrutiny of the settlement of this ethnic group is the subject of the fifth chapter, highlighting the various modes that these immigrants have adopted. In the sixth chapter social differences, the position of women and the second generation and older and newer cohorts are examined in relation to their religions. The seventh chapter is devoted to a study of the effects of religious institutions as described in chapter three. Chapter eight analyses the religious beliefs and philosophies of this ethnic group.  The conclusion summarises the outcome of this study and shows how religion and ethnicity have become important features in the various identities of this immigrant community, pointing to other related areas of study for future research.

In freedom we trust,Ed Buckner,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16769130W?edition=ia%3Ainfreedomwetrust0000buck,/authors/OL758783A/Ed_Buckner,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25404407M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Prometheus Books|Language English,"I'm one of the authors (Ed); my son Michael is the other. Here's the official description from Prometheus:  Opponents attack the president of the United States for not being a real Christian. Bitter arguments erupt over whether the United States is or should be a Christian nation. Sound familiar? These contentious issues are not just recent developments but were also the topics of fierce debate in the late eighteenth century. Like President Obama today, President Thomas Jefferson had to contend with accusations that his religious convictions were questionable. Against complaints that the writers of the Constitution did not invoke God, John Adams replied, “It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had interviews with the gods.”  In Freedom We Trust covers these and other related issues from the two-centuries-long debate over religion and secularism in America. Taking an unabashedly atheistic point of view, authors Edward M. and Michael E. Buckner argue that everyone—from evangelical Christian to ardent atheist—needs a secular America and separation of church and state. They examine the decidedly unchristian roots of the Fourth of July, the important difference between “tolerance” and “tolera- tion,” the misleading confusions related to the difference between “public” and “governmental,” the value of secular schooling, the erroneous contention that atheism is equivalent to immorality and therefore dangerous, and a host of other contemporary and historical topics.  With a list of key dates related to the history of secular America, notes, bibliography, and glossary, In Freedom We Trust offers important facts and arguments for secular humanists and anyone with an    interest in freedom of conscience.  EDWARD M. BUCKNER (Smyrna, GA), formerly the president of American Atheists and executive director of the Council for Secular Humanism, is now a member of the board of directors of American Atheists. He contributed to The New Encyclopedia of Unbelief (edited by Thomas W. Flynn) and the Fundamentals of Extremism: The Christian Right in America (edited by Kimberly Baker), among other publications.  MICHAEL E. BUCKNER (Decatur, GA) is the coeditor of Quotations that Support the Separation of State and Church, with Edward M. Buckner, among other publications. He is the vice president of the Atlanta Freethought Society.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Though it has over 5 million followers worldwide, it is still little understood outside of its own community. The Bahá'í ̕Faith: A Guide for the Perplexed explores the utopian vision of the Bahá'í ̕Faith including its principles for personal spiritual transformation and for the construction of spiritualized marriages, families, Bahá'í communities, and, ultimately, a spiritual world civilization. Aimed at students seeking a thorough understanding of this increasingly studied religion, this book is the ideal companion to studying and understanding the Bahá'í Faith, its teachings and the history of its development.

Intelligently Designed,Edward Caudill,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL16811288W?edition=ia%3Aintelligentlydes0000caud,/authors/OL32004A/Edward_Caudill,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25436617M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  University of Illinois Press|Language English,"Creationists' tactics in the culture wars, from the Scopes trial to today. Tracing the growth of creationism in America as a political movement, this book explains why the particularly American phenomenon of anti-evolution has succeeded as a popular belief. Conceptualizing the history of creationism as a strategic public relations campaign, Edward Caudill examines why this movement has captured the imagination of the American public, from the explosive Scopes trial of 1925 to today's heated battles over public school curricula. Caudill shows how creationists have appealed to cultural values such as individual rights and admiration of the rebel spirit, thus spinning creationism as a viable, even preferable, alternative to evolution. In particular, Caudill argues that the current anti-evolution campaign follows a template created by Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, the Scopes trial's primary combatants. Their celebrity status and dexterity with the press prefigured the Moral Majority's 1980s media blitz, more recent staunchly creationist politicians such as Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, and creationists' savvy use of the Internet and museums to publicize their cause. Drawing from trial transcripts, media sources, films, and archival documents, Intelligently Designed highlights the importance of historical myth in popular culture, religion, and politics and situates this nearly century-old debate in American cultural history. - Publisher.
