Tai is determined to know who the boy's father is, and enlists the help of her best friend Vivian to find out the truth. But what they discover is more than either of them ever wanted to know.Vivian must also deal with the return of her husband's former assistant, a woman who believes that if it wasn't for Vivian, she would have been first lady of Kingdom Citizens Christian Center. Millicent's back too, just in time for the marriage of Hope and Cy, the man she thought she'd be marrying. So what happens when love feels more like harried hell instead of hallelujah?

Departing from the traditional emphasis on the Fayyum, it offers a coherent framework for understanding the structure of the Ptolemaic state, and thus of the economy as a whole. Drawing for the first time on both Greek and demotic papyri, as well as hieroglyphic inscriptions and theories taken from the social sciences, Professor Manning argues that the traditional central state 'despotic' model of the Egyptian economy is insufficient. The result is a subtler picture of the complex relationship between the demands of the new state and the ancient, locally-organized social structure of Egypt. By revealing the dynamics between central and local power in Egypt, the book shows that Ptolemaic economic power ultimately shaped Roman Egyptian social and economic institutions.

The southpaw,"Harris, Mark",literature,First published in 1953,/works/OL1937249W?edition=ia%3Asouthpaw0000harr,/authors/OL232471A/Harris_Mark,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3177354M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1984|Publisher  University of Nebraska Press|Language English|Pages 350,"With The Southpaw, novelist Mark Harris begins the remarkable saga of a gifted baseball pitcher named Henry W. Wiggen, which would unfold in four novels over the course of some 27 years between the publication of The Southpaw (1952) and It Looked Like For Ever (1979).  Harris frames The Southpaw in an irresistible way, letting the fictional hero Wiggen ""tell"" his own story in the vernacular -- bad grammar, run-on sentences, the works.  In fact, the title page tells the reader that The Southpaw is ""by Henry W. Wiggen / Punctuation freely inserted and spelling greatly improved by Mark Harris.""Henry Wiggen is a beautiful athlete -- a perfect physical specimen and a gifted left-handed pitcher in a world that generally favors the right-handed.  Despite his talents and his natural grace, the unpretentious small-town boy reaches manhood by the same arduous route followed by most boys.  It is complicated, in his case, by that very talent and grace, and the expectations they create in everyone.  Wiggen is that rarest of fiction heroes, a certifiable good guy, without guile, who wants always to do the right thing.  Even for him, the challenges posed by personal and professional needs sometimes seem to be too much, as the stakes in his career steadily rise.  The Southpaw follows Wiggen from his early days all the way to the World Series, a winning story of a good man living an extraordinary life.""By far the best 'serious' baseball novel published,"" the San Francisco Chronicle wrote of The Southpaw -- a critical response that is frequently echoed in discussions of all four of Mark Harris' novels about Henry Wiggen.  The Southpaw defines Wiggen, and Harris wields his vivid, stream of conscious style with wizardly skill.  His hero is not a simple or uncomplicated man, he simply sees things as they are and says what he thinks.  Wiggen is one of the most disarming characters in modern American fiction, in the age of the anti-hero.  Harris does not paint him as a role model but as something much more compelling -- a good man, with his share of flaws, whose basic decency allows him to be a hero.

Rich with magic and achingly beautiful, they speak of a land of heroic battles, intense love and warrior ideals, in which the otherworld is explored and men mingle freely with the gods. From the vivid adventures of the great Celtic hero Cu Chulaind, to the stunning 'Exile of the Sons of Uisliu' – a tale of treachery, honour and romance – these are masterpieces of passion and vitality, and form the foundation for the Irish literary tradition: a mythic legacy that was a powerful influence on the work of Yeats, Synge and Joyce.

Jumping into her car, she flees her Chicago home and a few days later pulls up to a bleak motel in the Southwest--the Thunder Lodge. There, she encounters misfits, much like herself, who also carry secrets: the motel's terse proprietors, their mentally disabled son, and a woman transporting her niece to the father she's never met. But when the parents of Susannah's baby discover her whereabouts, she can no longer ignore the profound power she holds over their lives. Beautifully written, How Far Is the Ocean from Here explores the ways in which people care for one another and the ways in which they fail, the kinds of families we create when we have no one else to turn to, and the strangeness and unpredictability of love.From the Hardcover edition.

Saying Grace takes place in Rue's mid-life, when her daughter is leaving home, her parents are failing, her husband is restless and the school she has built is being buffeted by changes in society that affect us all. Funny, rich in detail and finally stunning, this novel presents a portrait of a tight-knit community in jeopardy, and of a charming woman whose most human failing is that she wants things to stay the same. Saying Grace is about the fragility of human happiness and the strength of convictions, about keeping faith as a couple whether it keeps one safe or not. Beth Gutcheon has a gift for creating a world in microcosm and capturing the grace in the rhythms of everyday life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Im Jahre 1960 wurde unter der Ägide des Germanisten Hermann Kunisch eine Neue Folge begründet, die inzwischen auf nunmehr 44 Bände gediehen ist. In der fächerübergreifenden Zeitschrift werden Beiträge zur Germanistik, Anglistik/Amerikanistik und Romanistik auf Deutsch und in den zu den Fächern gehörenden Sprachen publiziert. Außerdem enthält sie einen umfangreichen Besprechungsteil.  Das Literaturwissenschaftliche Jahrbuch ist auf keine Methode festgelegt.

The judicator said the word as if it was sour to her, ashen and alien on her tongue. She indicated the three shadowy forms around her. ""Tribune Delos will observe for Major Helek. Tribune Nadei will observe for Commander Medaka and the Romulan Senate. And our… visiting advocate will observe for the Human captain"".    Riker shielded his eyes, trying to peer past the light from the glow-globes to get a good look at the person assigned to him, but it was impossible to pick out anything. The shadow gave him nothing, no face, no hint of gender, only uncertainty.    He knew little of Romulan legal practices. Was Riker's silent watcher his lawyer, his judge? Executioner, even? He banished that last notion with a grimace.    Will Riker stood foursquare behind his every decision, even after everything that had happened over the last few days. What that would mean here and now in this place, he couldn't know. But there would be no obfuscation from him, no wordplay and clouding of the truth.    And once again, something came back to Riker, something Picard had said to him, years earlier on their very first mission together. If we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

So when she is invited to meet the vibrant, bohemian family next door in their messy house full of books and paintings and empty of rules, Carol soon begins a secret double life over the much-hated garden hedge. Here Carol voices her greatest fantasy and tells her first major lie...that she is adopted. But on her 16th birthday Carol receives the shock of her life when her wish comes true. And as, years later, Carol frenetically narrates her story from a psychiatric unit, we realise how it affected her and those around her in the darkest of ways . . .

Zhongguo ren shi gang (中國人史綱),Boyang,literature,First published in 1979,/works/OL4014787W,/authors/OL741335A/Boyang,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Xing guang chu ban she|Language Chinese|Pages 1011,"Zhong Guo Ren Shi Gang (literally “An Outline of Chinese History”) takes readers on a tour from 3000 BCE to the end of Boxer Rebellion in the early 20th Century. But this is not a mere outline, as the title claims. This is a comprehensive look at Chinese society throughout history, including the rise and fall of dynasties, kingdoms, philosophies, and trends. Boyang tracks the changes in China’s economic development, as well as its borders. He also pays attention to the social conditions of the people at large, and how they were affected by changes in government and philosophy.  Boyang wrote the manuscript for Zhong Guo Ren Shi Gang when he was a political prisoner in Taiwan. First published in 1979, this two-volume work was perhaps the first Chinese chronology to express time using a Western format, using centuries and BCE/CE. Up until then, time had been expressed in terms of each emperor’s reign. For example the 20th year of emperor Dao Guang’s reign may not mean much to an average person who is not familiar with emperors and their reign names. This, however, was the year of the Opium War (1840), which eventually led to the Treaty of Nanking and China’s loss of Hong Kong to England. Reign names made it difficult to map China’s development to that of other countries. In this book, each chapter covers a century; at the end of the chapter, a brief chronology of major world events is presented. This gives readers a better opportunity to place Chinese history in its global context.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Cambridge companion to Bunyan,Anne Dunan-Page,literature,First published in 2010,/works/OL18744937W,/authors/OL6863563A/Anne_Dunan-Page,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""John Bunyan was a major figure in seventeenth-century Puritan literature, and one deeply embroiled in the religious upheavals of his times. This Companion considers all his major texts, including The Pilgrim's Progress and his autobiography Grace Abounding. The essays, by leading Bunyan scholars, place these and his other works in the context of seventeenth-century history and literature. They discuss such key issues as the publication of dissenting works, the history of the book, gender, the relationship between literature and religion, between literature and early modern radicalism, and the reception of seventeenth-century texts. Other chapters assess Bunyan's importance for the development of allegory, life-writing, the early novel and children's literature. This Companion provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to an author with an assured and central place in English literature""--Provided by publisher.

Is the work optimistic or pessimistic, pro- or anti-Augustan? Should we read it as a eulogy or a bitter critique of Rome and her imperial ambitions? This book suggests that the ambiguity of the poem is the product of a complex and thorough-going engagement with earlier writers in the didactic tradition: Hesiod, Aratus and - above all - Lucretius. Drawing on both traditional, philological approaches to allusion, and modern theories of intertextuality, it shows how the world-views of the earlier poets are subjected to scrutiny and brought into conflict with each other. Detailed consideration of verbal parallels and of Lucretian themes, imagery and structural patterns in the Georgics forms the basis for a reading of Virgil's poem as an extended meditation on the relations between the individual and society, the gods and the natural environment.

It is the late 1960s in Yorkville, Toronto's hippie ghetto of artists, intellectuals, drunken poets, and would-be rock stars. In this idyllic haven, narrator Bill Hansen, a drummer, meets Thomas Graham, an American musician on the lam from the draft. The two form a band, but even as they revel in music and freedom, Graham is hobbled by another love: a drug habit that becomes his reason for living and, eventually, for dying. Graham's emotional trip and failed, revolutionary life reflect the rise and fall of an entire generation's aspirations.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now, almost twenty years after ending his ground-breaking saga of San Francisco life, Maupin revisits his all-too-human hero, letting the fifty-five-year-old gardener tell his story in his own voice.Having survived the plague that took so many of his friends and lovers, Michael has learned to embrace the random pleasures of life, the tender alliances that sustain him in the hardest of times. Michael Tolliver Lives follows its protagonist as he finds love with a younger man, attends to his dying fundamentalist mother in Florida, and finally reaffirms his allegiance to a wise octogenarian who was once his landlady.Though this is a stand-alone novel—accessible to fans of Tales of the City and new readers alike—a reassuring number of familiar faces appear along the way. As usual, the author's mordant wit and ear for pitch-perfect dialogue serve every aspect of the story—from the bawdy to the bittersweet. Michael Tolliver Lives is a novel about the act of growing older joyfully and the everyday miracles that somehow make that possible.

Taking its title from Walter Winchell's famous radio salutation,  Good Evening Mr. and Mrs. America  opens in Washington, DC, in 1964, just after the Kennedy assassination, telling the story of Walter Marshall, an idealistic 19-year-old who lives with his widowed mother and studies to be a journalist like his hero, Edward R. Murrow. In this coming-of-age novel in the truest sense of the phrase, young Marshall fumbles toward manhood in a nation that is itself in the midst of cataclysmic change.With the same elegance and precision that has distinguished his other novels, Richard Bausch has evoked a sense of time and place in a different America and brings the last 30 years of history profoundly and vividly to life.

But for a brief period - from just after the publication of Howl in 1957 until the building was sold in 1963 - it was home to Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Brion Gysin, Peter Orlovsky, Harold Norse, and a host of other luminaries of the Beat Generation. Now, Barry Miles - acclaimed author of many books on the Beats and a personal acquaintance of many of them - vividly excavates this remarkable period and restores it to a historical picture that has, until now, been skewed in favor of the two coasts of America."" ""A cheap rooming house on the bohemian Left Bank, the hotel was inhabited mostly by writers and artists, and its communal atmosphere spurred the Beats to incredible heights of creativity.""--BOOK JACKET.

When the book was displayed the next year, the exhibition catalogue described it as ""well and piously used [with] marginal notations in an Elizabethan hand [that] bring to life an early and earnest owner""; and the book's buyer, for his part, considered it to be ""enlivened by the marginal notes and comments."" For this collector, as for an increasing number of cultural historians and historians of the book, a marked-up copy was more interesting than one in pristine condition.  William H. Sherman recovers a culture that took the phrase ""mark my words"" quite literally. Books from the first two centuries of printing are full of marginalia and other signs of engagement and use, such as customized bindings, traces of food and drink, penmanship exercises, and doodles. These marks offer a vast archive of information about the lives of books and their place in the lives of their readers.  Based on a survey of thousands of early printed books, Used Books describes what readers wrote in and around their books and what we can learn from these marks by using the tools of archaeologists as well as historians and literary critics. The chapters address the place of book-marking in schools and churches, the use of the ""manicule"" (the ubiquitous hand-with-pointing-finger symbol), the role played by women in information management, the extraordinary commonplace book used for nearly sixty years by Renaissance England's greatest lawyer-statesman, and the attitudes toward annotated books among collectors and librarians from the Middle Ages to the present.  This wide-ranging, learned, and often surprising book will make the marks of Renaissance readers more visible and legible to scholars, collectors, and bibliophiles.

Holmes was unique - as the first fictional detective to solve crimes by using empirical deduction and icy logic, untainted by romanticism and preconceived notions.  As a medical student at Edinburgh University, Conan Doyle learned advanced techniques of diagnosis, which could equally well be applied to crime solving. Theatrical demonstrations in the art of diagnostics staged by his Medical School tutor, Dr. Joseph Bell, inspired the author to endow Holmes with a similar ability to shock his colleagues and culprits by dramatically revealing the secret heart of a crime.  Eventually, Conan Doyle tired of the pressure to continually write Sherlock's adventures He first killed off his masterpiece in the famous plunge over the Reichenbach Falls, Holmes locked in combat with his arch nemesis, Moriarty. But each time he tried to put an end to Holmes, Conan Doyle succumbed to public pressure (and financial necessity), to revive his best-loved creation, and the stories remain classics to this day.  The Mysterious World of Sherlock Holmes is a one-of-a-kind companion volume, bringing the master detective and his world back to life through carefully researched text and more than 150 illustrations. It examines his famous cases and enemies, reawakens the streets of crime-ridden Victorian London, featuring real-life murder weapons of the period, invites you into 221b Baker Street and details Holmes memorabilia and the detective's legacy today.  For Holmes enthusiasts, collectors, and crime students alike, The Mysterious World of Sherlock Holmes is essential reading to unlock the essence of these classic crime tales and draw connections to their real life counterparts.

Jane Clarke leads a simple yet rich life in the small village of Satucket on Cape Cod. The vibrant scent of the ocean breeze, the stark beauty of the dunes, the stillness of the millpond are among the daily joys she treasures. Her days are full attending to her father's needs, minding her younger siblings, working with the local midwife. But at twenty-two, Jane knows things will change. Someday, perhaps soon, she will be expected to move out of her father's home and start a household of her own.  Yet some things—including the bitter feud between her father and a fellow miller named Winslow—appear likely to remain the same. When the dispute erupts into a shocking act of violence, Jane's lifelong trust in her father is shaken. Adding to her unease is Phinnie Paine, the young man Jane's father has picked out as son-in-law as well as business partner. When Jane defies her father and refuses to accept Phinnie's marriage proposal, she is sent away to Boston to make her living as she can.  Arriving in this strange, bustling city awash with red coats and rebellious fervor, Jane plunges into new conflicts and carries with her old ones she'd hoped to leave behind. Father against daughter, Clarke against Winslow, loyalist against rebel, command against free will—the battles are complicated when her growing attachment to her frail aunt, her friendship with the bookseller Henry Knox, and the unexpected kindness of the British soldiers pit her against the townspeople who taunt them and her own beloved brother, Nate, a law clerk working for John Adams.  But when Jane witnesses British soldiers killing five colonists on a cold March evening in 1770, an event now dubbed ""the Boston Massacre"", she must question seeming truths and face one of the most difficult choices of her life, alone except for the two people who continue to stand by her—her grandparents Lyddie and Eben Freeman.  Grippingly rendered, filled with some of the lesser known but most influential figures of America's struggle for independence—John and Samuel Adams, Henry Knox, James Otis—The Rebellion of Jane Clarke is a compelling story of one woman's struggle to find her own place and leave her own mark on a new country as it is born.

A recent war between the United States and China has thinned the population and brought social chaos. The dollar has been locally replaced by Massachusetts scrip; instead of taxes, one pays protection money to competing racketeers. Nevertheless, Ben's life, traced by his journal entries over the course of a year, retains many of its accustomed comforts, as supervised by his vibrant wife, Gloria. He plays golf; he pays visits to his five children and ten grandchildren. Something of a science buff, he finds his personal history caught up in the disjunctions and vagaries of the ""many-worlds  hypothesis derived from the indeterminacy of quantum theory. His identity branches into variants extending back through history and ahead in the evolution of the universe, as both it and his own mortal, nature-enshrouded existence move toward the end of time.From the Hardcover edition.

These novels, devoted to the lives of the heroines that make them so irresistible, have a way of hitting too close to home — well, to the Homestead actually, where Anne-Marie runs the quaint family-owned bed and breakfast. In this enchanting debut novel, Penny and her mother encounter great women from classic works of literature who make the Homestead their destination of choice just as the plots of their tumultuous, unforgettable stories begin to unravel. They appear at all hours of the day and in all manners of distress. A lovesick Madame Bovary languishes in their hammock after Rodolphe has abandoned her, and Scarlett O'Hara's emotions are not easily tempered by tea and eiderdowns. These visitors long for comfort, consolation, and sometimes for more attention than the adolescent Penny wants her mother to give. Knowing that to interfere with their stories would cause mayhem in literature, Anne-Marie does her best to make each Heroine feel at home, with a roof over her head and a shoulder to cry on. But when Penny begins to feel overshadowed by her mother's indulgence of each and every heroine, havoc ensues, and the thirteen-year-old embarks on her own memorable tale.""--Powells.com.

In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists re-set its iconic Doomsday Clock to three minutes to midnight, as close to the apocalypse as it has been since 1953. What pushed its hands was, however, not just the threat of nuclear weapons, but also other global environmental risks that the Bulletin judged to have risen to the scale of the nuclear, including climate change and innovations in the life sciences.

"Political Theory, Science Fiction, and Utopian Literature: Ursula K. Le Guin and The Dispossessed",Tony Burns,literature,First published in 2008,/works/OL3009976W?edition=ia%3Apoliticaltheorys00burn,/authors/OL462414A/Tony_Burns,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27081703M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Lexington Books|Language English|Pages 319,"Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed is of interest to political theorists partly because of its association with anarchism and partly because it is thought to represent a turning point in the history of utopian/dystopian political thought and literature and of science fiction. Published in 1974, it marked a revival of utopianism after decades of dystopian writing. According to this widely accepted view The Dispossessed represents a new kind of literary utopia, which Tom Moylan calls a 'critical utopia.' The present work challenges this reading of The Dispossessed and its place in the histories of utopian/dystopian literature and science fiction. It explores the difference between traditional literary utopia and novels and suggests that The Dispossessed is not a literary utopia but a novel about utopianism in politics. Le Guin's concerns have more to do with those of the novelists of the 19th century writing in the tradition of European Realism than they do with the science fiction or utopian literature. It also claims that her theory of the novel has an affinity with the ancient Greek tragedy. This implies that there is a conservatism in Le Guin's work as a creative writer, or as a novelist, which fits uneasily with her personal commitment to anarchism.

Meanwhile, several miles uptown and perched near the top of the Upper East Side's social register, Luke McGavock has postponed his accumulation of wealth in an attempt to recover the sense of purpose now lacking in a life that often gives him pause--especially with regard to his teenage daughter, whose wanton extravagance bears a horrifying resemblance to her mother's. But on a September morning, brightness falls horribly from the sky, and people worlds apart suddenly find themselves working side by side at the devastated site, feeling lost anywhere else, yet battered still by memory and regret, by fresh disappointment and unimaginable shock. What happens, or should happen, when life stops us in our tracks, or our own choices do? What if both secrets and secret needs, long guarded steadfastly, are finally revealed? What is the good life? Posed with astonishing understanding and compassion, these questions power a novel rich with characters and events, both comic and harrowing, revelatory about not only New York after the attacks but also the toll taken on those lucky enough to have survived them. Wise, surprising, and, ultimately, heart-stoppingly redemptive, The Good Life captures lives that allow us to see--through personal, social, and moral complexity--more clearly into the heart of things.From the Hardcover edition.

When the First Horseman thunders forth, pestilence will spread throughout the land.  For the First Horseman is Plague...  The Spanish Flu killed thirty million people worldwide in 1918.  Now, with history threatening to repeat itself, a scientific expedition speeds toward a remote island in the Arctic Sea to recover strains of the lethal virus preserved under layers of ice.  For Washington Post reporter Frank Daly, it is the story of a lifetime.  But his plan to join the expedition is ruined by a ferocious storm that delays him.  And when he meets up with the ship upon its return to port in Norway, it is clear that something has gone terribly wrong.  Fear haunts the faces of the crew.  No one will talk.  And someone wants Daly to stop asking questions.  But if there's a wall around the facts, Daly will batter it down.  Persistent and resourceful, he knows how to get answers when none are given.  Yet the more he uncovers, the more dangerous the stakes become. Until at last he comes face-to-face with a shocking secret, pitching him into a harrowing race to prevent nothing less than...apocalypse.

She tries hard to follow the time-honored customs of the Charleston Camellia Society, as her mother and grandmother did, standing up straight in cotillion class and attending lectures about all the things that Camellias don't do. (Like ride with boys in pickup trucks.)But Sarah can't quite ignore the barbarism just beneath all that propriety, and as soon as she can she decamps South Carolina  for a life in New York City  . There, she and her fellow displaced Southern friends try to make sense of city sophistication, to understand how much of their training applies to real life, and how much to the strange and rarefied world they've left behind. When life's complications become overwhelming, Sarah returns home to confront with matured eyes the motto ""Once a Camellia, always a Camellia""- and to see how much fuller life can be, for good and for ill, among those who know you best.Girls in Trucks introduces an irresistable, sweet, and wise voice that heralds the arrival of an exciting new talent.

It was an important book because it argued that ""sexuality"" and ""desire"" were not a historical phenomenon but carefully managed social constructs. This insight (that actually originated with Michael Foucault) is often viewed as anti-humanist or post-humanist because it argues that men and women are simply the products of patriarchal power relations over which they have no control. By mobilizing Foucault's theories of the history of sexuality Sedgwick re-fashions Feminism and Gay and Lesbian Studies to make it seem as though Feminism and Gay and Lesbian studies are ideally situated to continue those interventions into the history of sexuality begun by Foucault.

For years, she has been the caretaker of her psychotic mother, Camille-the tiara-toting, lipstick-smeared laughingstock of an entire town-a woman trapped in her long-ago moment of glory as the 1951 Vidalia Onion Queen. But when Camille is hit by a truck and killed, CeeCee is left to fend for herself. To the rescue comes her previously unknown great-aunt, Tootie Caldwell.In her vintage Packard convertible, Tootie whisks CeeCee away to Savannah's perfumed world of prosperity and Southern eccentricity, a world that seems to be run entirely by women. From the exotic Miz Thelma Rae Goodpepper, who bathes in her backyard bathtub and uses garden slugs as her secret weapons, to Tootie's all-knowing housekeeper, Oletta Jones, to Violene Hobbs, who entertains a local police officer in her canary-yellow peignoir, the women of Gaston Street keep CeeCee entertained and enthralled for an entire summer.Laugh-out-loud funny and deeply touching, Beth Hoffman's sparkling debut is, as Kristin Hannah says, ""packed full of Southern charm, strong women, wacky humor, and good old-fashioned heart."" It is a novel that explores the indomitable strengths of female friendship and gives us the story of a young girl who loses one mother and finds many others.

Talese|Language English|Pages 368","It is 1959 when Haruko, a young woman of good family, marries the Crown Prince of Japan, the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne. She is the first non-aristocratic woman to enter the longest-running, almost hermetically sealed, and mysterious monarchy in the world. Met with cruelty and suspicion by the Empress and her minions, Haruko is controlled at every turn. The only interest the court has in her is her ability to produce an heir. After finally giving birth to a son, Haruko suffers a nervous breakdown and loses her voice. However, determined not to be crushed by the imperial bureaucrats, she perseveres. Thirty years later, now Empress herself, she plays a crucial role in persuading another young woman--a rising star in the foreign ministry--to accept the marriage proposal of her son, the Crown Prince. The consequences are tragic and dramatic. Told in the voice of Haruko, meticulously researched and superbly imagined, The Commoner is the mesmerizing, moving, and surprising story of a brutally rarified and controlled existence at once hidden and exposed, and of a complex relationship between two isolated women who, despite being visible to all, are truly understood only by each other. With the unerring skill of a master storyteller, John Burnham Schwartz has written his finest novel yet.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It provides interdisciplinary readings of incest within father-daughter, sibling, mother-son, cousin and uncle-niece relationships in texts by authors including Emily Brontë, Eliza Parsons, Ann Radcliffe and Eleanor Sleath. The analyses, underpinned by historical, literary and cultural contexts, reveal that the incest thematic allowed writers to explore a range of related sexual, social and legal concerns. Through representations of incest, Gothic writers modelled alternative agencies, sexualities and family structures that remain relevant today.

Like an avenging, purple-haired Jedi bringing balance to the mansplained universe, Bee Königswasser lives by a simple code: What would Marie Curie do? If NASA offered her the lead on a neuroengineering project—a literal dream come true after years scraping by on the crumbs of academia—Marie would accept without hesitation. Duh. But the mother of modern physics never had to co-lead with Levi Ward.  Sure, Levi is attractive in a tall, dark, and piercing-eyes kind of way. And sure, he caught her in his powerfully corded arms like a romance novel hero when she accidentally damseled in distress on her first day in the lab. But Levi made his feelings toward Bee very clear in grad school—archenemies work best employed in their own galaxies far, far away.  Now, her equipment is missing, the staff is ignoring her, and Bee finds her floundering career in somewhat of a pickle. Perhaps it’s her occipital cortex playing tricks on her, but Bee could swear she can see Levi softening into an ally, backing her plays, seconding her ideas…devouring her with those eyes. And the possibilities have all her neurons firing. But when it comes time to actually make a move and put her heart on the line, there’s only one question that matters: What will Bee Königswasser do?

City of the Sun: a novel,David Levien,literature,First published in 2007,/works/OL1927683W?edition=ia%3Aisbn_9780739327807,/authors/OL231136A/David_Levien,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16427772M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Random House Large Print|Language English,"Riveting suspense in the tradition of Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly, City of the Sun introduces retired detective Frank Behr--an imposing, charismatic former cop who agrees to take the case of a boy who's been missing for over a year.Jamie Gabriel gets on his bike before dawn to deliver newspapers in his suburban Indianapolis neighborhood. He is twelve years old. Somewhere en route, as the October sky lightens, he vanishes without a trace.Fourteen months later, Paul and Carol Gabriel are on the verge of abandoning all hope. Crushed by frustrating dead ends and exhausted by a police force that cannot (or will not) find their son, the Gabriels finally find a ray of hope: the name of an elusive private investigator who may represent their last chance.Frank Behr is an enigmatic mountain of a man, a former cop who wants to help--but knows better than to give the Gabriels any hope of a happy ending. He has worked this kind of case too often. But Paul's plea stirs up old personal demons that Behr can no longer ignore. Going against everything he fears, Behr enters into an uneasy partnership with Paul on a quest for the truth that is, in turn, dangerous ... and haunting.Richly textured and crackling with suspense on every page, City of the Sun weaves a moody narrative that hinges on the bond between a damaged detective and a lost father. From the antiseptic comforts of suburban Indianapolis to the city's seamy underworld, David Levien introduces a private investigator as complex, idiosyncratic, and sympathetic as any in modern crime fiction. Levien is a gifted storyteller who will keep readers guessing right up until the final, explosive scene.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ashton moves between the iconic figures of American modernism - Stein, Williams, Pound - and developments in contemporary American poetry to show how contemporary poetics, specially the school known as language poetry, have attempted to redefine the modernist legacy. She explores the complex currents of poetic and intellectual interest that connect contemporary poets with their modernist forebears. The works of poets such as Gertrude Stein and John Ashbery are explained and analysed in detail. This major new account of the key themes in twentieth-century poetry and poetics develops important new ways to read both modernist and postmodernist poetry through their similarities as well as their differences. It will be of interest to all working in American literature, to modernists, and to scholars of twentieth-century poetry.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf|Language English|Pages 313,"The literature of the last half-century in Spain is not the less interesting to study because it is largely experimental, largely negative, forming a period of transition, a preparation for a mightier future. If the writers of this period somewhat resemble stone-cutters sitting by a quarry, each diligently chiselling his separate stone, rather making ready the materials for a splendid edifice than themselves building it, their work is nevertheless necessary and important, often individually charming and delightful. That a splendid future awaits Spanish literature can hardly be doubted in view of the ever-increasing interest now taken in Spanish studies throughout the ""civilized"" world and the growing appreciation for the force and beauty of the most noble of living languages. - Introduction.

She read her way around all the globe's 196 independent countries (plus one extra), sampling one book from every nation - from classics and folk tales to current favourites and commercial triumphs, via novels, short stories, memoirs, biographies, narrative poems and countless mixtures of all these things. It wasn't easy. Many languages have next to nothing translated into English; there are tiny, tucked-away places where very little is written down at all; some governments don't like to let works of art leak out to corrupt Westerners. Her literary adventures shed light on the issues that affect us all: personal, political, national and global. What is cultural heritage? How do we define national identity? Is it possible to overcome censorship and propaganda? And how can we celebrate, challenge and change our remarkable world?   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this wide spanning text Brintlinger traces the war experiences, memories, tropes, and metaphors in literature of the Soviet and post-Soviet period, examining the work of Dmitry Furmanov, Fyodor Gladkov, Alexander Tvardovsky, Emmanuil Kazakevich, Vera Panova, Viktor Nekrasov, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Voinovich, Sergei Dovlatov, Vladimir Makanin, Viktor Astafiev, Viktor Pelevin, and Vasily Aksyonov. These authors represented official Soviet literature and underground or dissident literature. They fell into and out of favor, were exiled and returned to Russia, and died at home and abroad. Most importantly, each of these writers was touched by war and reacted to the state of war in their literary works.    ""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Eros and Polis,Paul W.

Because of the tiny size of ancient Greek cities, contemporary theory and ideology could conceive of entire communities based on desire. A recurrent aspiration was to transform the polity into one great household that would bind the citizens together through ties of mutual affection. In this study, Paul Ludwig evaluates  sexuality, love, and civic friendship as sources of political attachment, and as bonds of political association. Studying the ancient view of eros recovers a way of looking at political phenomena that provides a bridge, missing in modern thought, between the private and public spheres, between erotic love and civic commitment. Ludwig's study thus has important implications for the theoretical foundations of community.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In these cultures, the returning warrior was often portrayed as a figure rendered dysfunctionally destructive or isolationist by the horrors of combat. This mythic portrayal of the returned warrior is consistent with modern studies of similar behavior among soldiers returning from war. Roger Woodard,Ŵs research identifies a common origin of these myths in the ancestral proto-Indo-European culture, in which rites were enacted to enable warriors to reintegrate themselves as functional members of society. He also compares the Italic, Indo-Iranian, and Celtic mythic traditions surrounding the warrior, paying particular attention to Roman myth and ritual, notably to the etiologies and rites of the July festivals of the Poplifugia and Nonae Caprotinae, and to the October rites of the Sororium Tigillum""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It's a girl! For most young couples, news of their unborn child's gender brings joyful anticipation. Not so for Isha Tilak and her husband, Nikhil. They already have a beloved daughter, but Nikhil's parents, hard-wired to favor male children above all, coldly reject little Priya at every turn. Vain and selfish, they see female grandchildren as burdens, and would just as soon never meet the one growing in Isha's belly. Even the obstetrician agrees, going so far as to suggest the unthinkable, throwing Nikhil into a rage—and changing Isha's life forever... When Nikhil is discovered brutally murdered, Isha is convinced it had something to do with his reaction to the doctor's hideous “solution” to their problem. Alone, grief-stricken, and relentlessly oppressed by in-laws who believe her baby is a bad omen, Isha sets out on her own. Born into a privileged class, Isha doesn't know the first thing about fending for herself, but to protect her precious daughters, she will learn. And she will cling to the hope given to her by a strange old mystic: that her baby will arrive on the auspicious night of Kojagari Purnima, the full harvest moon, and be a gift from Lakshmi, the goddess of well-being. Isha and her girls will need all the blessings they can get, for the greatest danger of all lies ahead...   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is the electrifying story of a psychologist who has devoted her life to tracking death. But when she volunteers for a research project that simulates the near-death experience, she will either solve life's greatest mystery -- or fall victim to its greatest terror. At Mercy General Hospital, Dr. Joanna Lander will soon be paged -- not to save a life, but to interview a patient just back from the dead. A psychologist specializing in near-death experiences, Joanna has spent two years recording the experiences of those who have been declared clinically dead and lived to tell about it. It's research on the fringes of ordinary science, but Joanna is about to get a boost from an unexpected quarter. A new doctor has arrived at Mercy General, one with the power to give Joanna the chance to get as close to death as anyone can.A brilliant young neurologist, Dr. Richard Wright has come up with a way to manufacture the near-death experience using a psychoactive drug. Dr. Wright is convinced that the NDE is a survival mechanism and that if only doctors understood how it worked, they could someday delay the dying process, or maybe even reverse it. He can use the expertise of a psychologist of Joanna Lander's standing to lend credibility to his study. But he soon needs Joanna for more than just her reputation. When his key volunteer suddenly drops out of the study, Joanna finds herself offering to become Richard's next subject. After all, who better than she, a trained psychologist, to document the experience? Her first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined it would be -- so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why this place is so hauntingly familiar. But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid....And just when you think you know where she is going, Willis throws in the biggest surprise of all -- a shattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page is turned.From the Hardcover edition.

From the story:There came a faint scratching at the door, a little whimpering whine. ""It is Partial, my dog, come after you,"" said I bitterly. ""He knows you are here. He never has done that way for me. He loves you."" ""He knows you are here, and he loves you,"" said she. ""That is why things come and scratch at doors where ruffians live."" I flung open the door. ""Partial,"" said I, ""come in; and choose between us."" But Partial would not choose. ""He wants us both, Helena!"" said I at last. ""He has wiped out logic, premises, conclusions, cause and effect, horse, cart and all! He wants us both! He wants a quiet home and independence, Helena, and usefulness, and contentment. Ah, my God!"" She reached down and put a hand on his head, but he only looked from one to the other of us, unhappy. ""Don't you love me, Helena?"" I asked quietly, after a time. ""For the sake of my dog, can you not love me?"" She continued stroking the head of the agonized Partial....And until, somewhat inarticulately, I had choked or spoken, and had caught her dark hair against my cheek and kissed her hair and stammered in her ear, and turned her face and kissed her eyes and her cheek and her lips many, many times, Partial held his peace and issued no decision....At least, I did not hear him....She was sobbing now, her head on my shoulder, as we sat on the locker seat, and Partial's head was on the cushion beside us, and he was silent and overjoyed, and tranquilly happy - seeing perhaps, that a quiet home would in the event be his, and that he was going to live happy ever after. And after I drew Helena's head closer to my face, I kissed her hair. ""Do you love me, Helena?"" I asked. ""Only the truth now, in God's name!""

Stylishly written, sophisticated but warmhearted and accessible, this is Isabel Wolff at her inimitable best.All men are beasts......or so Miranda Sweet believes. As an animal behaviourist, she can get inside the heads of deluded Dalmatians and introverted iguanas, but she can't work out why the men in her life behave so badly. Animals are braver kinder and a lot more reliable. So Miranda's given up on love to open her own clinic and work her magic on neurotic pets and their grateful owners.But can she keep the whole male species at bay for ever? Her best friend, Daisy, an incurably romantic wedding-planner, doesn't think so. When a delicious photographer comes into her life, even Miranda starts to wonder if she's been a bit hasty. But, just when she's letting her guard down, her past starts to catch up with her. Now, she has to face up to her own behaviour, which hasn't always been as sweet as she'd like to pretend...

Lost Men: A Novel,Brian Leung,literature,First published in 2007,/works/OL6028902W?edition=ia%3Alostmen00bria,/authors/OL1514679A/Brian_Leung,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9667941M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 12, 2007|Publisher  Shaye Areheart Books|Language English|Pages 288","A novel of rare grace and power, Lost Men is the story of a father and a son each confronting his past. Westen Chan was just eight years old when his Caucasian mother died and his father, Xin, sent him away to be raised by her relatives.  Twenty years later, after a lifetime of estrangement, Westen receives an invitation from his father to travel with him to China--a prom-ise Xin once made when Westen was a child. So it is that two strangers--a father and a son--travel halfway around the world to a land that one of them knows intimately and the other has never seen. As they tour the country, the two men reveal themselves slowly and awkwardly: Westen's history of failed relationships and his conflicted cultural identity; Xin's regret at leaving his son and the terrible secret he's kept too long. And in the end, their relationship may just hinge on the contents of a sealed letter written by Westen's mother before her death--one that threatens to answer the lifelong question neither of them has dared to ask. Powerful, moving, and beautiful, Lost Men is a stunning literary novel that explores cultural and ethnic identity, the meaning of family, the exigencies of fate, and the lengths to which we will go to reconnect with those we fear we have lost. Brian Leung reveals both the intimate hearts of his characters and the telling details of place with equal and substantial grace.From the Hardcover edition.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 272","Our narrator Neil Countryman becomes the last link between the world below and John William Barry, a man so intolerant of weakness and concupiscence he becomes a hermit in an Olympic Peninsula cave. John William is the conscience throughout the book; he is outraged by almost all human thought and aspiration. Never mind that his stunnng riches allow him to afford his outrage. But eventually his purity and its resulting isolation cost him very, very dearly. Mr. Guterson has constructed a deceptively easy-reading exhibit of the loftiness and impossibility of extreme idealism. Our ""Other"" is a superego to the world and bears the brunt of the resulting conflict.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm--and into Edgar's mother's affections.  Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires--spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward.  David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes--the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain--create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.

Green's avid and loyal fans follow her because she writes about the true-to-life dilemmas of women—and The Beach House will not disappoint. Known in Nantucket as the crazy woman who lives in the rambling house atop the bluff, Nan doesn't care what people think. At sixty-five-years old, her husband died twenty years ago, her beauty has faded, and her family has flown. If her neighbors are away, why shouldn't she skinny dip in their swimming pools and help herself to their flowers? But when she discovers the money she thought would last forever is dwindling and she could lose her beloved house, Nan knows she has to make drastic changes. So Nan takes out an ad: Rooms to rent for the summer in a beautiful old Nantucket home with water views and direct access to the beach. Slowly, people start moving into the house, filling it with noise, with laughter, and with tears. As the house comes alive again, Nan finds her family expanding.

Britain's transition from trading partner to colonial power is charted through a detailed analysis of an exceptionally wide range of representations of India. The book draws on many sources previously ignored by scholars: travel accounts, missionary letters, histories and parliamentary debates, as well as illustrations, novels and poetry. Kate Teltscher argues that writing about India is not monolithic or univocal, but that representations of India are diverse, shifting, historically contingent and frequently competitive. Using the techniques of textual analysis on non-literary as well as literary texts, she examines such issues as the contrasting representation of Muslim and Hindu women, the rhetoric of Catholic and Protestant missionaries, the construction of British authority, and the ever-present threat of Indian subversion.

Years before the defection of a Soviet submarine will send him hurtling into confrontation with the Soviets, historian, ex-Marine and CIA analyst Jack Ryan is vacationing in London with his wife and young daughter, when a terrorist attack takes place before his eyes. Instinctively, he dives forward to break it up, and is shot. It is not until he wakes up in the hospital that he learns whose lives he has saved -- the Prince and Princess of Wales and their new young son -- and which enemies he has made -- the Ulster Liberation Army, an ultra-left-wing splinter of the IRA.  By his impulsive act, he has gained both the gratitude of a nation and then enmity of its most dangerous men -- men who do not sit on their hate.

Ferdinand Tönnies had defined the problem of finding community within society in his 1887 book Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft. Kafka took up this issue by focusing upon the “social discourse” of human relationships. In this book the author examines Kafka’s three novels, Amerika, The Trial, and The Castle in their exploration of how community is formed or eroded in the interpersonal relations of its protagonists. Critical literature has recognized Kafka’s ability to narrate the gestural moment of alienation or communion. This “social discourse” was augmented, however, by a dimension virtually no commentator has recognized—Kafka’s conversation with past and present authors. Kafka encoded authors and their texts representing every century of the evolution of modernism and its societal problems.        Kafka encoded not only past authors, but painters as well. He had been known as a graphic artist in his youth, and was informed by expressionism and cubism as he matured. Kafka’s encodings of literature as well as fine art do not solely concern  the work to which he refers, but initiate reflection upon the milieu of authors or painters and their success or failure in realizing community among themselves. Kafka’s encodings were meant as extra-textual readings for astute readers, but also as a lesson to his fellow authors whom he held accountable as cultural messengers. Many of Kafka’s encodings are of Austrian satirists, among them Franz Christoph von Scheyb, Gottlieb Wilhelm Rabener, Josef Schreyvogel, and Franz Grillparzer. While Austrian literature is prominent, Kafka’s encodings are drawn from all Western literature. In The Castle, the figure of Momus becomes a major index in the history of Western literature, extended from Plato through Lucian, to Nicolaus Gerbel through Goethe. Momus, the arch-critic of manners, morals, and judge of human character, enables a Kafka reader to use this thread to comprehend the errors of commission and omission in the social discourse of his protagonists throughout his opus.       The intertextual conversation Kafka conducted can enable us to appreciate the profound human problem of realizing community within society. Cultural historians as well as literary critics will be enriched by the evidence of these encoded cultural conversations. Kafka’s “Imperial Messenger” may finally be heard in the full history of his emanations.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Everyone needs a guardian angel ... Some people wait their whole lives to find their soul mates. But not Holly and Gerry. Childhood sweethearts, they could finish each other's sentences and even when they fought, they laughed. No one could imagine Holly and Gerry without each other. Until the unthinkable happens. Gerry's death devastates Holly. But as her 30th birthday looms, Gerry comes back to her. He's left her a bundle of notes, one for each of the months after his death, gently guiding Holly into her new life without him, each note signed 'PS, I Love You'. As the notes are gradually opened, the man who knows Holly better than anyone sets out to teach her that life goes on. With some help from her friends, and her noisy and loving family, Holly finds herself laughing, crying, singing, dancing - and being braver than ever before. Life is for living, she realises - but it always helps if there's an angel watching over you.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Women, their father tells them, are like chopsticks: utilitarian and easily broken. Men, on the other hand, are the strong rafters that hold up the roof of a house. Yet when circumstances lead the sisters to seek work in distant Nanjing, the shocking new urban environment opens their eyes. While Three contributes to the success of a small fast-food restaurant, Five and Six learn new talents at a health spa and a bookshop/tearoom. And when the money they earn starts arriving back at the village, their father is forced to recognise that daughters are not so dispensable after all.Xinran has become known for her wonderful ability to take readers to the heart of Chinese society. In this new book she tells not only a human story, but the story of a city. As the Li sisters discover Nanjing, so do we: its past, its customs and culture, and its future as a place where people can change their lives.

A dazzling tour de force, Bright Shiny Morning illuminates the joys, horrors, and unexpected fortunes of life and death in Los Angeles.

Reminiscent of Jeffrey Eugenides's The Virgin Suicides and Joyce Carol Oates's Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang, The Queens of K-town introduces us to twenty-six-year-old Cora Moon. She returns to New York bruised, broken-hearted, and on the verge of ending it all. Ten years after she watched her best friend leap off the roof of a building, she's trying to hold onto the pieces of her own fragile existence while reliving her past. Her days are flooded with memories of her first summer there, when she became entrenched in a tight-knit group of girls who roamed the fluorescent alleyways of K-town. Along with her new teenage friends-Bev, Mina, and Soo Young-Cora navigated the fast-paced maze of nightclubs and hostess bars, engaging in backroom brawls and disastrous private meals with Korean mafia members. A haunting tale of desire and loss, and sex and suicide, The Queens of K-Town marks the arrival of a brave new voice in fiction. About the author: Angela Mi Young Hur was born in Los Angeles and raised in Gardena, California. She attended Andover, Harvard, and Notre Dame, where she received her MFA and was a Sparks Fellow and the Managing Editor of the Notre Dame Review. Upon graduation, she was awarded the Sparks Prize, which allowed her to write full-time for a year. She currently lives in Long Beach. The Queens of K-town is her first novel.

This collection of essays reflects on the origins of historicism and its present usefulness as a mode of literary analysis, its limitations, and its future. The volume provides a brief history of the practice from its renaissance origins, offering examples of historicist work that not only demonstrate the continuing vitality of this methodology but also suggest new directions for research. Focusing on the major figures of Shakespeare and Milton, these essays provide important and concise representations of trends in the field. Designed for scholars and students of early modern English literature (1500-1700), the volume will also be of interest to students of literature more generally and to historians""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Global trends of identity politics, performativity, cultural performance and ethics, comparative and revisionist historiography, ecological responsibility and education, as well as issues of social justice have shaped and been shaped by discussions in Native American and Indigenous Studies. This volume brings together distinguished perspectives on these topics by the Native scholars and writers Gerald Vizenor (Anishinaabe), Diane Glancy (Cherokee), and Tomson Highway (Cree), as well as non-Native authorities, such as Chadwick Allen, Hartmut Lutz, and Helmbrecht Breinig. Contributions look at various moments in the cultural history of Native North America--from earthmounds via the Catholic appropriation of a Mohawk saint to the debates about Makah whaling rights--as well as at a diverse spectrum of literary, performative, and visual works of art by John Ross, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, Emily Pauline Johnson, Leslie Marmon Silko, Emma Lee Warrior, Louise Erdrich, N. Scott Momaday, Stephen Graham Jones, and Gerald Vizenor, among others.

Yet to be vulnerable is central to human experience. In this book, McCoy examines ways in which Greek epic, tragedy, and philosophy have important insights to offer about the nature of human vulnerability and how human beings might better come to terms with their own vulnerability. While studies of Greek heroism and virtue often focus on strength of character, prowess in war, or the achievement of honor for oneself or one?s society, McCoy examines another side to Greek thought that extols the recognition and proper acceptance of vulnerability. McCoy begins with the literary works of Homer?s Iliad, Sophocles? Oedipus Rex, Oedipus at Colonus and Philoctetes before expanding her analysis to philosophical works. There, she analyzes imagery of wounding in Plato?s Gorgias and Symposium as well as Aristotle?s work on the vulnerability inherent in friendship and an innovative interpretation of tragic catharsis in the Poetics. As much a work of philosophy as of classical textual analysis, McCoy?s work aims at a deeper understanding of the virtues of vulnerability for individuals and societies alike.

These two components ajusted to each other by a series of composition processes. Therefore, they require the construction of a more abstract theoretical viewpoint where their specificities may be evaluated by means of a homogeneous approach.    The presentation of a descriptive model is complemented by numerous examples of popular Brazilian songs that clarify the theoretical notions and some complete analysis of selected songs.    The investigations on ""temporality"" proposed by some sectors of contemporary semiotics (especially by Claude Zilberberg) offer the main foundations to the model formulated in this book.

He traces the genealogy of these friendships through a series of stories. A dapper English spy inspires a Quaker boy to run away from home. Three Philadelphia gentlemen conduct a romance through diaries and letters in the 1780s. Flighty teenager Charles Brockden Brown metamorphoses into a horror novelist by treating his friends as his literary guinea pigs. Emerson exchanges glances with a Harvard classmate but sacrifices his crush on the altar of literature -- a decision Margaret Fuller invites him to reconsider two decades later. Throughout this book, Crain demonstrates the many ways in which the struggle to commit feelings to paper informed the shape and texture of American literature. - Jacket.

Jane Austen's Anglicanism,Laura Mooneyham White,literature,First published in 2011,/works/OL15538392W?edition=ia%3Ajaneaustensangli0000whit,/authors/OL1073063A/Laura_Mooneyham_White,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24494921M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Ashgate|Language English,"In her re-examination of Jane Austen's Anglicanism, Laura Mooneyham White suggests that engaging with Austen's world in all its strangeness and remoteness reveals the novelist's intensely different presumptions about the cosmos and human nature. While Austen's readers often project postmodern and secular perspectives onto an Austen who reflects their own times and values, White argues that viewing Austen's Anglicanism through the lens of primary sources of the period, including the complex history of the Georgian church to which Austen was intimately connected all her life, provides a context for understanding the central conflict between Austen's malicious wit and her family's testimony to her Christian piety and kindness. White draws connections between Austen's experiences with the clergy, liturgy, doctrine, and religious readings and their fictional parallels in the novels; shows how orthodox Anglican concepts such as natural law and the Great Chain of Being resonate in Austen's work; and explores Austen's awareness of the moral problems of authorship relative to God as Creator. She concludes by surveying the ontological and moral gulf between the worldview of Emma and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, arguing that the evangelical earnestness of Austen's day had become a figure of mockery by the late nineteenth century.  - Publisher.

Only a few months before, Richard II - weak, wicked, and treacherous  - had been dethroned, and Henry IV declared King in his stead. But it was only a seeming peacefulness, lasting but for a little while; for though King Henry proved himself a just and a merciful man - as justice and mercy went with the men of iron of those days - and though he did not care to shed blood needlessly, there were many noble families who had been benefited by King Richard during his reign, and who had lost somewhat of their power and prestige from the coming in of the new King.  Among these were a number of great lords - the Dukes of Albemarle, Surrey, and Exeter, the Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Gloucester, and others - who had been degraded to their former titles and estates, from which King Richard had lifted them. These and others brewed a secret plot to take King Henry's life, which plot might have succeeded had not one of their own number betrayed them.

She is a woman who is generally happy in her marriage and with her now predictable day-to-day life as wife, mother, and part-time breadwinner. Even though she is a New Englander at heart, Kate has reached a point where rodeos, summer heat, sharp light, and the vast, desolate beauty of the West have become almost second nature to her. She loves her husband and daughter, is fond of her neighbors, and enjoys the company of her mother-in-law. Yet, privately, she longs for the conversations and stories of her past, and she can't help but feel disconnected from the people around her.In walks Tom Baxter, Kate's mother-in-law's new suitor from ""back East.""Kate is immediately drawn to Tom—his gentle charm and engaging conversation spark an unusual companionship. Tom seems like the little piece of home that Kate so misses. She's curious about him and about his story, but finds unexplained gaps and inconsistencies that pique her interest to a new level. Then a series of peculiar and seemingly suspicious events leads Kate to a terrifying conclusion—a conclusion that could forever shatter her life and the lives of those she loves.In this debut novel, Dorie McCullough Lawson vividly captures a familiar American landscape. Filled with unforgettable characters and written in eloquent yet suspenseful prose, Along Comes a Stranger is a darkly humorous novel that examines the depth of identity and family life.

Trade in opium with Europe is slowly corroding the power of the Ch'ing Dynasty. Orchid, a beautiful seventeen-year-old from an aristocratic but impoverished family, is pushed into the maelstrom when she finds herself unexpectedly chosen to become a lower-ranking concubine of the Emperor. The world inside the Forbidden City is erotically charged and highly ritualised, but beneath its immaculate face lie whispers of murders and ghosts. The thousands of concubines will go to any lengths to bear the Emperor a son and become his Empress. Determined not to be a victim of the jealousies and foul play, Orchid trains herself in the art of pleasuring a man, bribes her way into the royal bed and seduces the monarch. Little does she know that China will collapse around her, and she will be its last Empress.  EMPRESS ORCHID is the story of this fascinating, strong-willed woman who for generations has been vilified as a grand seductress and murderess. Anchee Min draws a vivid portrait of a flawed yet utterly compelling woman and, through her life, the world of the Chinese court and the sexual and political lives of the royal concubines. Richly detailed and completely gripping, this is a novel of high drama and lyricism from the acclaimed author of Becoming Madame Mao and Red Azalea.

Beyond Apollo,Barry N.

Evans, is unable to explain what has happened.  Or, conversely, he has too many explications; his journal of the expedition - compiled in the mental institution to which NASA has embarrassedly committed him - offers contradictory stories: he murdered the Captain, mad Venusian invaders murdered the Captain, the Captain vanished, no one was murdered and the Captain has returned in Evans' guise...as the explanations pyramid and as the supervising psychiatrist's increasingly desperate efforts to get a straight story fail, it becomes apparent that Evans's madness and his inability to explain what happened are expressions of humanity's incompetence at the enormity of space exploration.  The novel, published by Random House as its inaugural work in a proposed new science fiction program, was controversial and became even more so when it won the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel.  Many felt that the award, regardless of the novel's accomplishment, was an insult to Campbell (1910-1971), the great editor of Astounding Science Fiction Magazine whose name had always been synonymous with the wonder and complexity of space exploration.  Campbell, some argued, would never have published a novel given an award in his name; others responded that Campbell had always honored controversy and the expansion of familiar means of thought, a category into which Beyond Apollo certainly fell.  Beyond Apollo has been in and out of print in the thirty years since its publication but an edition has always been available in the USA or in one or more of the 12 European and Scandinavian countries to which it was sold.

At the heart of these controversies is Jesus. With a unique perspective only Sylvia Browne could bring, The Mystical Life of Jesus is filled with the details of Jesus' inspiring life.Including his birth, childhood, travels, ministry, miracles, crucifixion, death, and resurrection, she addresses all of the major controversies:• Was there a virgin birth?• Was there a Star of Bethlehem?• What did he do for the first thirty years of his life?• Was he married?• Was he divine?• Was it a miracle at Cana (and who was getting married)?• Is there a Jesus lineage?Using her unique relationship with her spirit guide and her years studying the controversial Gnostic texts, Sylvia answers all of these questions with a confidence and authority only someone who has visited the afterlife can have.

The history of Western thought contains hundreds of such statements by major philosophers testifying to the use of esoteric writing in their own work or others'. Despite this long and well-documented history, however, esotericism is often dismissed today as a rare occurrence. But by ignoring esotericism, we risk cutting ourselves off from a full understanding of Western philosophical thought... Philosophy Between the Lines is the first comprehensive, book-length study of the history and theoretical basis of philosophical esotericism, and it provides a crucial guide to how many major writings--philosophical, but also theological, political, and literary--were composed prior to the nineteenth century.""--Publisher's Web site.

Questioning everything in an attempt to make sense of the world he is discovering through books, he is on the cusp of an understanding of what it is to be a man. But, when the Master, his caring old guardian, gives him a letter from his long-dead mother, his world comes crashing down. Learning for the first time that his father is not dead, as he had been led to believe, the boy must relearn everything he thought he knew. He sets out to find his father, piecing together the information he can glean from his mother's letter: he is a journalist for the BBC, he has lived in London, and he is a Muslim. The boy sets out to find his father. Arriving in London, disorientated and alone, he finds himself at the centre of a terrorist attack as the BBC is bombed and hundreds are killed and injured. Taken under the caring wing of Sister Bridget, a nun also caught up in the chaos, he refuses to allow this catastrophe to move him from his goal; he must find his father. This is the heart-warming tale of a young boy trying to find his way in a changing world, a world where no-one is safe and where terrorists seek to destroy all that civilisation holds dear.

Matthew Acciaccatura of Teaneck, New Jersey, begins his freshman year at NYU in the fall of 1995 with one goal in mind: to become cool. A former high school outcast, used to lumbering the hallways alone in oversize turtlenecks, Matt seems an unlikely candidate for such a transformation. Yet by dint of effort he lands the coveted position of promoter at one of the hottest clubs in New York in the heyday of rave music and Ecstasy. However, as ""Magic"" Matt rises to fame, portents of tragedy begin to appear, literally in the margins of the story. Footnotes from one Dr. Hans Mannheim, an imprisoned German academic obsessed with Matt's dangerous trajectory, suggest that Matt is not as in control of his destiny as he might appear....A gorgeously written archetypal tale of self-discovery (and self-deception) and a love letter to the enduring possibilities of New York City, The Answer Is Always Yes will keep readers guessing until its explosive climax.From the Hardcover edition.

When their son Ethan sets off for university, discovering for the first time, the raw and uncontrollable intensity of falling in love, Gaby and Connor will be alone again - a chance to rediscover their relationship, just the two of them. But there is one person missing from Gaby's life. One person whom she cannot forget - Nancy, her best friend since childhood. As teenagers they shared their deepest secrets, fears and dreams for the future. As adults they discovered love - Gaby with Connor and Nancy with Gaby's adored brother, Stefan. The foursome became inseparable. Then one day, Nancy upped and left. Now, almost twenty years later, with Ethan away from home, Gaby finds herself idly watching television when a sharp stab of recognition hits her - the face she recognises on the screen belongs to Nancy. Suddenly, the friend she thought she'd lost for good is within her reach. But does Nancy want to be found? The search for her long lost friend forces Gaby not only to revisit her past, but could also shatter the course of her future ...   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Orphan Catherine Mayhew is barely surviving in the Big Apple, as a walk-on actress, when she answers a mysterious ad promising an out-of-town engagement and plenty of money. The catch? An old one. Catherine, you see, is a dead ringer for Karen, the long-disappeared granddaughter of elderly, ill Josephine Andexter--whose niece and nephew, artists Eunice and Brian, hire Catherine to impersonate Karen. . .just to make the old lady's last months happy. Hmmm. So """"Karen"""" arrives at Pinehaven in Maine, soon adoring """"her"""" grandmother--who is overjoyed, and seems to revive. But Catherine/Karen is puzzled by the hostility of housekeeper Mrs. Brill, certain townspeople, and blue-eyed Joel Cartwright--the real Karen's old lover. (Karen, it seems, was cold, callous, and devious.) Will the new Karen convince everyone that she's now a good person? Especially Joel? Or will the resident bad guys--who have more than one murder to their credit--get rid of Catherine/Karen before she and Joel can find the real Karen and expose all the nefarious doings? More Woolworth's than L.L. Bean, but tidier than some of Johnston's others--and very serviceable for the long, time following.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Observing them and darkening their lives is the principal, Parley Burns, whose strange behaviour culminates in an attack so disturbing its repercussions continue to the present day.  Connie's niece, Anne, tells the story. Impelled by curiosity about her dynamic, adventurous aunt and her more conventional mother, she revisits Connie's past and her mother's broken childhood. In the process, she unravels the enigma of Parley Burns and the mysterious (and unrelated) deaths of two young girls.--""BOOK JACKET.

The discussion is situated in relation to the predominantly male tradition of Caribbean poetry, and explores the factors which have resulted in the relative marginality of women poets within nationalistic poetic discourses. Denise deCaires Narain employs a range of cutting-edge feminist and postcolonial approaches to focus on a wide range of themes, such as orality, sexuality, the body, performance and poetic identity. Contemporary Caribbean Women's Poetry provides detailed readings of individual poems by women poets whose work has not yet received the sustained critical attention it deserves. These readings are contextualized both within Caribbean cultural debates and postcolonial and feminist critical discourses in a lively and engaged way; revisiting nationalist debates as well as topical issues about the performance of gendered and raced identities within poetic discourse. It will be ground-breaking reading for all those interested in postcolonialism, Gender Studies, Caribbean Studies and contemporary poetry.

"Jane Austen, Game Theorist",Michael Suk-Young Chwe,literature,First published in 2013,/works/OL19367045W,/authors/OL2769397A/Michael_Suk-Young_Chwe,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26822474M-M.jpg,"Publish Date Apr 21, 2013|Publisher  Princeton University Press|Pages 288","Game theory—the study of how people make choices while interacting with others—is one of the most popular technical approaches in social science today. But as Michael Chwe reveals in his insightful new book, Jane Austen explored game theory’s core ideas in her six novels roughly two hundred years ago. Jane Austen, Game Theorist shows how this beloved writer theorized choice and preferences, prized strategic thinking, argued that jointly strategizing with a partner is the surest foundation for intimacy, and analyzed why superiors are often strategically clueless about inferiors. With a diverse range of literature and folktales, this book illustrates the wide relevance of game theory and how, fundamentally, we are all strategic thinkers.    Although game theory’s mathematical development began in the Cold War 1950s, Chwe finds that game theory has earlier subversive historical roots in Austen’s novels and in “folk game theory” traditions, including African American folktales. Chwe makes the case that these literary forebears are game theory’s true scientific predecessors. He considers how Austen in particular analyzed “cluelessness”—the conspicuous absence of strategic thinking—and how her sharp observations apply to a variety of situations, including U.S. military blunders in Iraq and Vietnam.    Jane Austen, Game Theorist brings together the study of literature and social science in an original and surprising way.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What is race and why does it matter? What motivates the human tendency to construct Others? Why does the presence of Others make us so afraid? Drawing on her Norton Lectures, Toni Morrison takes up these and other vital questions bearing on identity in The Origin of Others. In her search for answers, the novelist considers her own memories as well as history, politics, and especially literature. Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Camara Laye are among the authors she examines. Readers of Morrison's fiction will welcome her discussions of some of her most celebrated books--Beloved, Paradise, and A Mercy. If we learn racism by example, then literature plays an important part in the history of race in America, both negatively and positively. Morrison writes about nineteenth-century literary efforts to romance slavery, contrasting them with the scientific racism of Samuel Cartwright and the banal diaries of the plantation overseer and slaveholder Thomas Thistlewood. She looks at configurations of blackness, notions of racial purity, and the ways in which literature employs skin color to reveal character or drive narrative. Expanding the scope of her concern, she also addresses globalization and the mass movement of peoples in this century. National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates provides a foreword to Morrison's most personal work of nonfiction to date.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Langer, our age clings to the stable relics of faded eras, as if ideas like natural innocence, innate dignity, the inviolable spirit, and the triumph of art over reality were immured in some kind of immortal shrine, immune to the ravages of history and time. But these ideas have been ravaged, and in Admitting the Holocaust Langer presents a series of essays that represent his effort, over nearly a decade, to wrestle with this rupture in human values and to see the Holocaust as it really was. These penetrating and often gripping essays cover a wide range of issues, from the Holocaust's relation to time and memory and its portrayal in literature to its use and abuse by culture and its role in reshaping our sense of history's legacy. In many, Langer examines the ways in which accounts of the Holocaust -- in history, literature, film, and theology -- have extended, and sometimes limited, our insight into an event that is often said to defy understanding itself. - Back cover.

Demonstrating how female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances.  Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. He rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity; considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities; and explores issues of transsexuality among “transgender dykes”—lesbians who pass as men—and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of “lesbian” a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators.  Featuring a new preface by the author, this twentieth anniversary edition of Female Masculinity remains as insightful, timely, and necessary as ever.

Through their challenges and victories, we are encouraged to identify and claim our own challenges and victories.  Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance takes us inside the clubs, theatres, and relationships that made Harlem, New York City, the one-time “Party Capital of the World,” and one of the greatest cultural centers of any era. It also places on bold display the genius that gave the world ragtime, Jazz, the blues, gospel, swing, and all night dancing. Whereas previously the Harlem Renaissance was considered primarily as the literary achievement of a handful of writers, Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance demonstrates that it was a triumphant exultation of creative genius across the cultural board and one that spread both nationally and internationally. Moreover, through leaders such as James Weldon Johnson, A. Philip Randolph, and W. E. B. Du Bois, it laid the foundation for what would grow into the extraordinary Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

As she waits for the arrival of the charismatic figure who is the key to the mystery, she recounts her life story – a rich and extraordinary tale spanning two generations of storytellers and deal-makers, fortune-tellers and gamblers, businessmen and warlords, and the people that feared, served and betrayed them. With each twist of this tumultuous story Lucy revisits her childhood and early adolescence – trying to get her head around the things people do in the name of love and hate, greed and desire – and she pieces together afresh the events that led to the night that still haunts her.

"Aguecheek's beef, belch's hiccup, and other gastronomic interjections",Robert Appelbaum,literature,First published in 2008,/works/OL13669441W?edition=ia%3Aaguecheeksbeefbe0000appe,/authors/OL6524927A/Robert_Appelbaum,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22743554M-M.jpg,Publisher  University of Chicago Press|Pages 375,"We didn’t always eat the way we do today. It was only at the advent of the early modern period that people stopped eating with their hands from trenchers of bread and started using forks and plates, that lords stopped inviting scores of neighbors to dine together in great halls and instead ate separately in private rooms, and that Europeans started worrying about dining a la mode, from the most refined nouvelle cuisine.Aguecheek’s Beef, Belch’s Hiccup tells the story of how early modern Europeans put into words these complex and evolving relationships between cooks and diners, hosts and guests, palates and tastes, food and humankind. Named after two memorable characters in Twelfth Night, this lively history of food and literature draws on sources ranging from cookbooks and medical texts to comic novels and Renaissance tragedies. Robert Appelbaum expertly weaves such sources together to show how people invented new genres and ways of speaking to express interest in food. He also recounts the evolution of culinary practices and attitudes toward food, connecting them with contemporaneous developments in medical science, economics, and colonial expansion. As he does so, Appelbaum paints a colorful picture of a remarkably conflicted culture in which food was many things—from a symbol of happy sociability to a token of selfish gluttony, from an icon of cultural life to a cause for social struggle.Peppered with illustrations and even a handful of recipes, Aguecheek’s Beef, Belch’s Hiccup looks at our basic staple of daily existence from an entirely fresh perspective that will appeal to anyone interested in early modern literature or the history of food.

Strangers manage to revive him, but he is unable to speak. Police carry him to the nearest hospital, where he is not admitted because he has no money or identification. Frantically trying to communicate, he scribbles notes in ancient Greek and German that would have told the world about a discovery of immense importance—if anyone had read them. . . .Reaching from the wonders of ancient Greece to a harrowing quest in modern-day Europe, The Lost Throne features Jonathon Payne and D. J. Jones, former members of a top secret, very special unit of the armed forces. Now as private citizens they still get recruited from time to time for the most delicate —and dangerous—missions. Payne and Jones must race to recover the lost treasure that could rewrite history, before it is destroyed by a group of men who will stop at nothing to conceal the secret.

He was just a lowly hussar. Their love affair in turn-of-the-century Vienna was to scandalize a continent. The story of Princess Louise of Belgium and Geza Mattachich, stepson of a minor Croatian count, began with no more than an exchanged glance in a park. Yet the princess and her soldier, divided by wealth and status, pursued their devotion to one another through scandal, ruin, madness and imprisonment. Dan Jacobson's brilliant imagining of this forgotten episode of the Hapsburg court brings to life one of the century's great love stories.

The town of Goodnight by the Sea lies on a peninsula between two bays, Red Moon and Humosa, and for years its people, many of them immigrants drawn to this ragged edge of America, have struggled to get by. When Gabriel Perez, a local shrimper, gets laid off, he also manages to lose his girlfriend, Una Vu, a beautiful Vietnamese-Hispanic waitress who is unhappy with both the smallness of her life and Gabriel's petty anger. Gabriel blames Falk Powell, a teenage co-worker of Una's, for stealing her heart and begins plotting a revenge that will take an unexpected turn. Gusef, their unlikely Russian entrepreneur employer, takes young Falk under his wing. All the while, an impending hurricane gathers ominously in the Gulf.Goodnight, Texas is a poignant, powerful, comic, surprisingly hopeful story about a love affair within the beauty of a decaying bayside village, about wanting what you cannot have, and about what happens when a coastal Texas town is swamped by a killer hurricane. Cobb has written a timely vision of resilience and personal survival amidst the collapse of small town American life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A concert pianist on the London scene, his career is upended when the train he is travelling on crashes into the wall at the end of a tunnel. The accident splinters his left wrist, jeopardizing his musical ambitions. On a whim, he uses his compensation pay-out to buy a house he has seen only once in a newspaper photograph, a replica of Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye on a stretch of coast outside Cape Town. Together with his wife, Mim, Mr. Field sets out in the hope that the house will make him happier, or at least less unhappy. But as time passes, the house-which Le Corbusier designed as ""a machine for living""-begins to have a disturbing effect on Mr. Field. Its narrow windows educate him in the pleasures of frustrated desire. Its sequence of spaces, which seem to lead toward and away from their destinations at once, mirror his sense of being increasingly cut off from the world and from other people. When his wife inexplicably leaves him, Mr. Field can barely summon the will to search for her. Alone in the decaying house, he finds himself unglued from reality and possessed by a longing for a perverse kind of intimacy. OK, Mr. Field is a strange and beguiling novel that dwells in the silences between words, in the gaps in conversation, and in the unbridgeable distance between any two people. Through her restless intelligence and precise, musical prose, Katharine Kilalea confidently guides us into new fictional territory.

Devastated by his loss, but secure in their love, Claybird feels as though life could almost go on as usual in their small, sleepy Southern hometown. Until Uncle Gabe comes back. A stranger to Claybird, Uncle Gabe is a brilliant academic who disappeared twenty years ago. Despite the deep mystery that surrounds him, Gabe's humor and intellect shine, and he quickly positions himself in the role of the Catts family's patriarch, filling the role of Claybird's dead father. Gabe and Claybird become coconspirators and best friends, until a slip of the tongue unveils the real history of their relationship, a heart-wrenching revelation that turns Claybird's world upside down.

While out celebrating with a group of friends a few nights before the wedding, Michael suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself enclosed in a coffin equipped only with a flashlight, a dirty magazine, a walkie-talkie, and a tiny breathing tube. It's all in good fun — payback for the grief his mates suffered due to his own penchant for tomfoolery — that is until the four are killed in a drunk driving accident just moments after leaving Michael completely alone and buried alive.  Detective Superintendent Grace—himself dealing with the pain of losing his wife—is brought on to the case when Ashley reports Michael missing. Suspicions are raised when Michael's only friend not at the bachelor party refuses to cooperate, and Ashley's faithfulness—not to mention her increasingly mysterious past—are suddenly thrown in to question. As Superintendent Grace soon discovers, one man's disaster is another man's fortune.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|2 Currently reading|1 Have read

From local bars to trainyards to prison, it is the story of two young men, bound to the town by family, responsibility, inertia, and the beauty around them, who dream of a future beyond the factories and abandoned homes.Left alone to care for his aging father after his mother commits suicide and his sister escapes to Yale, Isaac English longs for a life beyond his hometown. But when he finally sets out to leave for good, accompanied by his temperamental best friend, former high school football star Billy Poe, they are caught up in a terrible act of violence that changes their lives forever.Evoking John Steinbeck's novels of restless lives during the Great Depression, American Rust takes us into the contemporary American heartland at a moment of profound unrest and uncertainty about the future. It is a dark but lucid vision, a moving novel about the bleak realities that battle our desire for transcendence and the power of love and friendship to redeem us.

Early Public Libraries and Colonial Citizenship in the British Southern Hemisphere,Lara Atkin,literature,First published in 2019,/works/OL20907708W,/authors/OL8000030A/Lara_Atkin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28321473M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Springer Nature|Pages 159,"This open access Pivot book is a comparative study of six early colonial public libraries in nineteenth-century Australia, South Africa, and Southeast Asia. Drawing on networked conceptualisations of empire, transnational frameworks, and ‘new imperial history’ paradigms that privilege imbricated colonial and metropolitan ‘intercultures’, it looks at the neglected role of public libraries in shaping a programme of Anglophone civic education, scientific knowledge creation, and modernisation in the British southern hemisphere. The book’s six chapters analyse institutional models and precedents, reading publics and types, book holdings and catalogues, and regional scientific networks in order to demonstrate the significance of these libraries for the construction of colonial identity, citizenship, and national self-government as well as charting their influence in shaping perceptions of social class, gender, and race. Using primary source material from the recently completed ‘Book Catalogues of the Colonial Southern Hemisphere’ digital archive, the book argues that public libraries played a formative role in colonial public discourse, contributing to broader debates on imperial citizenship and nation-statehood across different geographic, cultural, and linguistic borders.

The result is this supple and effervescently witty translation of Cyrano de Bergerac.  As befits the translator who contributed subtitles to the acclaimed Jean-Paul Rappenau film (starring Gérard Depardieu), Burgess has produced a Cyrano of immense theatricality: one that combines verse and prose, along with judicious cuts and rearrangements, to restore the biting comedy, high pathos, and, above all, the panache, missing from what was previously the standard English translation   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Though these two volumes are the only ones that Woolf compiled herself, they have seldom been considered as a whole. As a result, what they reveal about Woolf's position with regard to the processes of writing, reading, and critical analysis has not been fully examined.  Koutsantoni challenges the critical commonplace that equates Woolf's strategy of self-effacement and personal removal from her works as a necessary compromise that allowed her to achieve authorial recognition in a male-dominated context. Rather, Koutsantoni argues that an investigation of impersonality in Woolf's essays reveals the potential of the genre to function both as a vehicle for the subjective and dialogic expression of the author and reader and as a venue for exploring topics with which the ordinary reader can relate. As she explores and challenges the meaning of impersonality in Woolf's Common Reader, Koutsantoni shows how the related issues of subjectivity, authority, reader-response, intersubjectivity, and dialogism offer useful perspectives from which to examine Woolf's work.

A Vintage Books Original. Javier Marías is a tireless examiner of the world around us: essayist, novelist, translator, voracious reader, enthusiastic debunker of pretension, and vigorous polymath. He is able to discover what many of us fail to notice or have never put into words, and he keeps looking long after most of us have turned away. This new collection of essays--by turns literary, philosophical, and autobiographical--journeys from the crumbling canals of Venice to the wide horizons of the Wild West, and Marías captures each new vista with razor-sharp acuity and wit. He explores, with characteristic relish, subjects ranging from soccer to classic cinema, from comic books and toy soldiers to mortality and memory, from ""The Most Conceited of Cities"" to ""Why Almost No One Can Be Trusted,"" making each brilliantly and inimitably his own. Trenchant and wry, subversive and penetrating, Between Eternities is a collection of dazzling intellectual curiosity, offering a window into the expansive mind of the man so often said to be Spain's greatest living writer""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At the same time, critics accused film itself of exerting a hypnotic influence over spellbound audiences. Stefan Andriopoulos shows that all this anxiety over being governed by an outside force was no marginal oddity, but rather a pervasive concern in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Tracing this preoccupation through the period’s films—as well as its legal, medical, and literary texts—Andriopoulos pays particular attention to the terrifying notion of murder committed against one’s will. He returns us to a time when medical researchers described the hypnotized subject as a medium who could be compelled to carry out violent crimes, and when films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler famously portrayed the hypnotist’s seemingly unlimited power on the movie screen. Juxtaposing these medicolegal and cinematic scenarios with modernist fiction, Andriopoulos also develops an innovative reading of Kafka’s novels, which center on the merging of human and corporate bodies.Blending theoretical sophistication with scrupulous archival research and insightful film analysis, Possessed adds a new dimension to our understanding of today’s anxieties about the onslaught of visual media and the expanding reach of vast corporations that seem to absorb our own identities.

Fascinated with the potential of glass architecture, Scheerbart's satirical fantasies envisioned an electrified future, a world composed entirely of crystalline, colored glass.In 1912, Scheerbart published The Light Club of Batavia, a Novelle about the formation of a club dedicated to building a spa for bathing—not in water, but in light—at the bottom of an abandoned mineshaft. Translated here into English for the first time, this rare story serves as a point of departure for Josiah McElheny, who, with an esteemed group of collaborators, offers a fascinating array of responses to this enigmatic work.

Most significantly, she meets Dino, the dance host, whose motives in befriending Vi are shady, but who teaches her to ballroom dance - and inadvertently helps her to recover from her past.Moving between the late sixties and the present day, Dancing Backwards is written with the lightness of touch and psychological insight which characterise Salley Vickers' acclaimed work.

Something had been written by the gods, and Nathan Seltzer knew this was one Friday that he would regret. . . .It's the boom years of the 1980s, and life is closing in on Nathan Seltzer, who rarely travels beyond his suddenly gentrifying Lower East Side neighborhood. Between paralyzing bouts of claustrophobia, Nathan wonders whether he should cheat on his wife with Karoline, a German pastry maker whose parents may or may not have been Nazis. His father, Harry, is plotting with the 1960s boogaloo star Chow Mein Vega for the comeback of this dance craze. Meanwhile, a homicidal drug addict is terrorizing the neighborhood.With its cast of unforgettable characters, Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue is a comedy of cultures, of the old and the new, of Latinos, Jews, Sicilians, and Germans. It's about struggling to hold on to life in a rapidly changing world, about food and sex, and about how our lives are shaped by love and guilt.From the Hardcover edition.

The death of Ivan Ilyich and other stories,Lev Nikolaevič Tolstoy,literature,First published in 1960,/works/OL457392W,/authors/OL26783A/Lev_Nikolaevič_Tolstoy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23207976M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Alfred A. Knopf|Language English,"Here are some of Tolstoy's extraordinary short stories, from -The Death of Ivan Ilyich—in a masterly new translation-to -The Raid,- -The Wood-felling,- -Three Deaths,- -Polikushka,- -After the Ball,- and -The Forged Coupon,- all gripping and eloquent lessons on two of Tolstoy's most persistent themes: life and death. More experimental than his novels, Tolstoy's stories are essential reading for anyone interested in his development as one of the major writers and thinkers of his time.  As Ivan Ilyich lies dying he begins to re-evaluate his life, searching for meaning that will make sense of his sufferings. In ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" and the other works in this volume, Tolstoy conjures characters who, tested to the limit, reveal glorious and unexpected reserves of courage, or baseness of a near inhuman kind. Two vivid parables and ""The Forged Coupon"", a tale of criminality, explore class relations after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and the connection between an ethical life and worldly issues. In ""Master and Workman"" Tolstoy creates one of his most gripping dramas about human relationships put to the test in an extreme situation. ""The Death of Ivan Ilyich"" is an existential masterpiece, a biting satire that recounts with extraordinary power the final illness and death of a bourgeois lawyer. In his Introduction Andrew Kahn explores Tolstoy's moral concerns and the stylistic features of these late stories, sensitively translated by Nicolas Pasternak Slater. - Back cover.

She can think of nothing and no one else. But life under Ceausescu's Romania is difficult. Hunger, paranoia and fear infect everyone. One day Mona sees Mihai wearing the black leather jacket favoured by the secret police. Is it possible he is one of them? As food shortages worsen and more of her loved ones disappear, Mona comes to understand that she must leave Romania. She escapes in secret - narrowly avoiding the police - through Yugoslavia to Italy, and finally to Chicago. But she leaves without saying a final goodbye to Mihai. And though she struggles to bury her longing for the past, many years later she finds herself compelled to return, determined to learn the truth.

Catherine Madison is headed West with a suitcase full of cash that isn't hers. She's just left the only home she's ever known, a small town in Nebraska, after the only man she had ever known, her husband, Thomas, deserted her. She's also left behind her deepest, most shameful secrets-among them a dysfunctional family she's never quite been able to escape and a marriage whose most intimate moments have plagued her with self-doubt. On the road, she was going to become a new person. Or so she thought.But running away from the past isn't as easy as she had hoped. When Catherine reaches Las Vegas, she forms surprising new friendships that compel her to reveal what she had sworn she'd keep hidden, and teach her what human connection really means. Armed with this new knowledge, she is finally emboldened to uncover the truth about her family, come to understand what destroyed her marriage, and prevent her troubled sister from repeating her mistakes.Deeply compassionate and unflinchingly bold, The Melting Season is the story of an indelible character's journey from isolation to belonging, as well as an honest look at the things we feel we deserve from our lives- and how far we will go to find them.

Emily Dickinson; the critical revolution,Klaus Lubbers,literature,First published in 1968,/works/OL15835996W?edition=ia%3Aemilydickinsoncr00lubb,/authors/OL1037703A/Klaus_Lubbers,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23251321M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1968|Publisher  University of Michigan Press|Language English|Pages 335,"“Emily Dickinson’s rise to fame exemplifies the revolution in literary values that has occurred during the past century. In this book Klaus Lubbers examines the changing course of Dickinson criticism in America and England from the beginnings up to recent years. His study throws much light on shifting critical standards, and through its discussion of widely varying evaluations it provides a heightened understanding of her art. Lubbers shows that even during the 1890’s, when the first volumes were posthumously published, there were perceptive spirits who valued Emily Dickinson’s poetry. Among these were Mabel Loomis Todd, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and William Dean Howells. Yet American critics generally were baffled and grudging. In Great Britain the Scottish arbiter Andrew Lang was flatly hostile. As for the reading public, Higginson and Mrs. Todd felt it necessary, in editing the poems for publication, to make scores of textual changes in order to render them more acceptable to a generation accustomed to Whittier and Longfellow. It was during the creative and critical renaissance of the second decade of the twentieth century, Lubbers finds, that Emily Dickinson began to be discovered as one of the great American poets. In 1914 Harriet Monroe granted her, writes Lubbers, “honorary membership in the Imagist movement.” In the period that followed, others to take up her cause included Robert Hillyer, Herbert Gorman, Amy Lowell, Louis Untermeyer, Conrad Aiken, and Carl and Mark Van Doren. “Year by year,” Lubbers quotes Robert Hillyer, “the knowledge of her secret spreads, as friend whispers to friend and confides the inimitable poet to a new lover.” Lubbers marks the period from 1930 to the 196O’s as that in which Emily Dickinson’s reputation has been consolidated. In the 1930’s the New Critics, notably Allen Tate, Richard Blackmur, and Yvor Winters, contributed important insights to the understanding of her poetry. The thirties also saw the publication of George F. Whicher’s critical biography THIS WAS A POET. In the fifties and sixties came Thomas H Johnson s critical edition of the poems and Charles R. Anderson s interpretive study, EMILY DICKINSON’S POETRY: STAIRWAY OF SURPRISE. All these commentaries and many more are judiciously weighed in Lubbers’ impressively documented survey. In addition, this book unravels the tangled publication history of the poems; it investigates the textual changes in editions before Johnson’s and it points to the growing interest in Emily Dickinson reflected in novels and plays based on her life. Its list of more than 1,000 sources is by far the most complete Dickinson bibliography in print. Lubbers has, in short, produced a comprehensive work of scholarship that will be invaluable to students of criticism and readers of Emily Dickinson.” BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The poems recount his travels—New York, North Carolina, Lowell (Massachusetts, Kerouac’s birthplace), San Francisco, Denver, Kansas, Mexico—observations, and meditations on art and life. The poems are often strung together so that over the course of several of them, a little story—or travelogue—appears, complete in itself. Published for the first time, Book of Sketches offers a luminous, intimate, and transcendental glimpse of one of the most original voices of the twentieth century at a key time in his literary and spiritual development.

So when the musketeers discover a plan to accuse M. de Treville of treason, their reactions vary from the desire to kill the messenger, Benoit, to the need to unmask the man behind the plot to discredit their captain. But the first two suspects, the English ambassador and Cardinal Richelieu, prove to be innocent, and the musketeers are forced to delve deeper into the inner machinations of the French court. Meanwhile, Aristide finds himself falling in love with that fated messenger, a blacksmith without a home who rouses all of his protective, possessive instincts. Benoit, however, has no interest in any man. Torn between desire and duty, Aristide must find a way to protect the King, clear his captain's name, and save his friends—all while heeding the demands of his heart.

Moving away from reductive geographical or linguistic surveys of the Francophone world, this collection of original essays provides a thematic discussion of the complex historical, political and cultural links between France and its former colonies. Providing a theoretical framework for postcolonial criticism of the field, it also aims to trigger a genuine dialogue between Francophone and Anglophone scholars of postcolonialism.

Part II looks at language issues and discusses France's belief in the universality of its language and culture and the postcolonial challenges to that view. Part III discusses issues of diversity and multiculturalism in contemporary Francophone cultures. Part IV concludes with an analysis of the French-language contribution to postcolonialism as well as an examination of Francophone postcolonial thought and culture in the principal areas of the French-speaking world. Edited by two of the up-and-coming names in Francophone Postcolonial Studies, the collection includes contributions from an international team including some of the world's leading scholars in the field.

The Virago Book of Ghost Stories,Richard Dalby,literature,First published in 1988,/works/OL4164530W?edition=ia%3Aviragobookofghos00rich,/authors/OL786679A/Richard_Dalby,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9249093M-M.jpg,Publish Date March 1989|Publisher  Mcgraw-Hill|Language English,"For more than two hundred years the ghost story has held a particular fascination for women writers. From the Gothic novelists of the eighteenth century, through the stories of Mary Shelley and Mrs. Oliphant, to Elizabeth Bowen and Angela Carter, women have used the mystery of the supernatural to challenge myths and explore questions of sexuality, love, and identity in surprising and disquieting ways.  This marvelously diverse collection of twentieth-century tales - many from the 1920s and 1930s, the heyday of the ghost story - is the first anthology of ghost stories written by women. It includes work by some thirty writers, among them specially commissioned stories by such modern masters as Angela Carter, Sara Maitland, and Lisa St. Aubin de Terán. It also comprises stories by Elizabeth Taylor Edith Wharton, Elizabeth Jane Howard, Fay Weldon, Rose Macaulay, Norah Lofts, and many others.

Ancient philosophical poetics,Malcolm Heath,literature,First published in 2012,/works/OL16681940W,/authors/OL980284A/Malcolm_Heath,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""What is poetry? Why do human beings produce and consume it? What effects does it have on them? Can it give them insight into truth, or is it dangerously misleading? This book is a wide-ranging study of the very varied answers which ancient philosophers gave to such questions. An extended discussion of Plato's Republic shows how the two discussions of poetry are integrated with each other and with the dialogue's central themes. Aristotle's Poetics is read in the context of his understanding of poetry as a natural human behaviour and an intrinsically valuable component of a good human life. Two chapters trace the development of the later Platonist tradition from Plutarch to Plotinus, Longinus and Porphyry, exploring its intellectual debts to Epicurean, allegorical and Stoic approaches to poetry. It will be essential reading for classicists as well as ancient philosophers and modern philosophers of art and aesthetics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The range and depth of treatments of the palimpsest as both a concrete and a conceptual phenomenon are exemplary.”    --Laura Kendrick, Professor of Medieval Studies, Université de Versailles  “Altogether a fine tribute to, and celebration of, the life and work of a great scholar, André Crépin, on his eightieth birthday. 'Palimpsest' is given a broad definition in this collection of essays to cover both the material and the literary, that is, any alteration, abridgement, or translation of earlier texts. The contributions range from a discussion of palimpsests in manuscripts such as Beowulf, on wax tablets and vernacular engravings in the late medieval period, and how new digital technology can enhance our knowledge of palimpsests, to a broader interpretation of the word to cover the retelling, adaptation, or translation of earlier works in particular in the romance tradition, culminating in modern film adaptation of medieval literary works.”    --Graham Caie, Vice Principal, University of Glasgow  “Covering palimpsests both literal and literary, and ranging in subject matter from Beowulf to John Boorman’s Excalibur via Bede, the matière de Bretagne, Chaucer, and more, the contributions to this volume honor André Crépin with a sparkling series of investigations into the materiality, the composition, and the transmission of Old and Middle English texts.”    --Timothy Graham, Associate Professor, University of New Mexico   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Her ninth book of nonfiction, it brings together thirty-eight diverse and provocative pieces from the New York Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, and the New York Times Book Review.Oates states in her preface, ""In the essay or review, the dynamic of storytelling is hidden but not absent,"" and indeed, the voice of these ""conversations"" echoes the voice of her fiction in its dramatic directness, ethical perspective, and willingness to engage the reader in making critical judgments. Under the heading ""Not a Nice Person,"" such controversial figures as Sylvia Plath, Patricia Highsmith, and Muriel Spark are considered without sentimentality or hyperbole; under ""Our Contemporaries, Ourselves,"" such diversely talented figures as William Trevor, E. L. Doctorow, Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Connelly, Alice Sebold, Mary Karr, Anne Tyler, and Ann Patchett are examined. In sections of ""homages"" and ""revisits,"" Oates writes with enthusiasm and clarity of such cultural icons as Emily Bronte, Ernest Hemingway, Carson McCullers, Robert Lowell, Balthus, and Muhammad Ali (""The Greatest""); after a lapse of decades, she (re)considers the first film version of Bram Stoker's Dracula, and Americana, Don DeLillo's first novel, as well as the morality of selling private letters and the nostalgic significance of making a pilgrimage to Henry David Thoreau's Walden Pond.Through these balanced and illuminating essays we see Oates at the top of her form, engaged with forebears and contemporaries, providing clues to her own creative process: ""For prose is a kind of music: music creates 'mood.' What is argued on the surface may be but ripples rising from a deeper, subtextual urgency.""   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And living with Uncle Jonathan, a real wizard, was full of fun and surprises.  But while Uncle Jonathan practiced funny and comfortable white magic, the original owner of the old house, Isaac Izard, had been an evil sorcerer. He had devised a plan for bringing about the end of the world. Somewhere in the walls of the house he had hidden a clock. Every night Lewis and Uncle Jonathan could hear it ticking--sometimes loud, sometimes soft--marking off the minutes until doomsday.  Lewis knew they had to find the clock before it was too late. Then he decided to dabble in a little magic of his own, and their time almost ran out.  Cozy fireplaces, wacky magic, chocolate chip cookies, and terror are the ingredients John Bellairs has used to concoct this absorbing and original book.

But there's a single missing link in the chain of her life: love... She had it once--for a moment--with Finbar Burke, but a shared future is forbidden by history and blood. Which is why Fin has spent his life traveling the world to fill the abyss left in him by Branna, focusing on work rather than passion. Branna and Fin's relationship offers them both comfort and torment. And though they succumb to the heat between them, there can be no promises for tomorrow. A storm of shadows threatens everything that their circle holds dear. It will be Fin's power, loyalty, and heart that will make all the difference in an age-old battle between the bonds that hold their friends together and the evil that has haunted their families for centuries""--   Read more Read less",53 Want to read|0 Currently reading|11 Have read

It's where his sister, Branna, lives and works, where his cousin, Iona, has found true love, and where his childhood friends form a circle that can't be broken... A circle that is about to be stretched out of shape--by a long-awaited kiss. Meara Quinn is Branna's best friend, a sister in all but blood. Her and Connor's paths cross almost daily, as Connor takes tourists on hawk walks and Meara guides them on horseback across the lush countryside. She has the eyes of a gypsy and the body of a goddess...things Connor has always taken for granted--until his brush with death propels them into a quick, hot tangle. Plenty of women have found their way to Connor's bed, but none to his heart until now. Frustratingly, Meara is okay with just the heat, afraid to lose herself--and their friendship--to something more. But soon, Connor will see the full force and fury of what runs in his blood. And he will need his family and friends around him, when his past rolls in like the fog, threatening an end to all he loves.   Read more Read less",43 Want to read|2 Currently reading|13 Have read

What she learns repels her, challenges her, and changes her in ways she never could have imagined. And if you let it, it might change you, too.

This volume draws on recent developments in culture and gender theory to reveal ideological links between Muscular Christianity and the work of novelists and essayists, including Kingsley, Emerson, Dickens, Hughes, MacDonald, and Pater, and to explore the use of images of hyper-masculinised male bodies to represent social as well as physical ideals. Muscular Christianity argues that the ideologies of the movement were extreme versions of common cultural conceptions, and that anxieties evident in Muscular Christian texts, often manifested through images of the body as a site of socio-political conflict, were pervasive throughout society. Throughout, Muscular Christianity is shown to be at the heart of issues of gender, class, and national identity in the Victorian age.

Both literary and historical in its approach, this study shows how, in a period marked by extensive immigration, heated debates on national and racial traits, during a flowering in American letters, encouraged responses from American authors to outsiders that not only contain precious insights into nineteenth-century America’s self-construction but also serve to illuminate our own time’s multicultural societies. The authors under consideration are alternately canonical (Emerson, Hawthorne, Melville), recently rediscovered (Kirkland), or simply neglected (Arthur). The texts analyzed cover such different genres as diaries, letters, newspapers, manuals, novels, stories, and poems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And this unexpected friend, whose origins are mysterious, will change the boy and his aunt in wonderful ways that neither of them could ever have expected.

As the former mayor of Boston, Bernard Doyle wants to see his sons in politics, a dream the boys have never shared. But when an argument in a blinding New England snowstorm inadvertently causes an accident that involves a stranger and her child, all Bernard Doyle cares about is his ability to keep his children—all his children—safe. Set over a period of twenty-four hours, Run takes us from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard to a home for retired Catholic priests in downtown Boston. It shows us how worlds of privilege and poverty can coexist only blocks apart from each other, and how family can include people you've never even met. As in her bestselling novel Bel Canto, Ann Patchett illustrates the humanity that connects disparate lives, weaving several stories into one surprising and endlessly moving narrative. Suspenseful and stunningly executed, Run is ultimately a novel about secrets, duty, responsibility, and the lengths we will go to protect our children.

His grandmother taught him everything he needs to know to survive: She taught him to write things down so he won't forget them. She taught him to play the lottery every week. And, most important, she taught him whom to trust. When Gram dies, Perry is left orphaned and bereft at the age of thirty-one. Then his weekly Washington State Lottery ticket wins him 12 million dollars, and he finds he has more family than he knows what to do with. Peopled with characters both wicked and heroic who leap off the pages, Lottery is a deeply satisfying, gorgeously rendered novel about trust, loyalty, and what distinguishes us as capable.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 163,"Below the sign welcoming the new eighth-grade class to school is one that promises to leave no child unsuccessful and a handout that offers eight ways of being smart. For Edwin Hanratty, at times as hilarious as he is miserable, this is part of what makes junior high pretty much a relentless nightmare. And so, with Flake, his only friend, he contends with clique upon clique--the jocks who pummel them, the girls who ignore or taunt them--as well as the dogged and disconcerting attentions of a sixth-grader who's even more ferociously disaffected than they are. And while Edwin's parents work hard to understand him, they face without fully realizing it a demoralization so systemic that he and Flake have no recourse other than their own bitter and smart remarks, until they gradually begin flirting with the most horrible revenge of all. This lethal impulse, which has touched communities across America, has never been given such shocking credibility as it has in Project X, which suggests that these boys' central predicament is not their hatred of the world but their agonized and enduring love of it. Never before has Jim Shepard's compassionate virtuosity been on such conspicuous, unsettling, and haunting display.From the Hardcover edition.

While his works express a hope in human technology and progress, this is tempered by a realization of the possible extinction of humanity through the very same technology and the predilections of human nature.There is a strong ethical component to his work and this relates to the ambivalence that he often expressed about the potentialities of human nature. One of the central issues that concerned him was the disparity between the elite and the masses. The Time Machine explores these concerns in a setting 800,000 years into the future.The Invisible ManA terrifying story from the author of The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds. An obscure scientist invents a way to render skin, bones, and blood invisible, and tries the formula on himself. Now he can go anywhere, menace anyone--sight unseen. He has only two problems: he cannot become visible again--and he has gone quite murderously insane. One of the most famous scientific fantasies ever written, this highly imaginative tale focuses on the powers and bold ventures of a scientist, who, after discovering the means to make himself invisible, unleashes a bizarre streak of terror on the inhabitants of an English village. Filled with suspense and psychological nuances of plot.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

One goal of literary studies is to understand the ethical dimensions of the world, and thus service learning, by broadening the environments students consider, is well suited to the literature classroom. Whether through a public literacy project that demonstrates the relevance of literary study or community-based research that brings literary theory to life, student collaboration with community partners brings social awareness to the study of literary texts and helps students and teachers engage literature in new ways.  In their introduction, the volume editors trace the history of service learning in the United States, including the debate about literature’s role, and outline the best practices of the pedagogy. The essays that follow cover American, English, and world literature; creative nonfiction and memoir; literature-based writing; and cross-disciplinary studies. Contributors describe a wide variety of service-learning projects, including a course on the Harlem Renaissance in which students lead a community writing workshop, an English capstone seminar in which seniors design programs for public libraries, and a creative nonfiction course in which first-year students work with elderly community members to craft life narratives. The volume closes with a list of resources for practitioners and researchers in the field.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The final harvest of our great nature writer's last years, Wild Fruits presents Thoreau's distinctly American gospel -- a sacramental vision of nature in which ""the tension between Thoreau the naturalist and Thoreau the missionary for nature's wonders invigorates nearly every page"" (Time). In transcribing the 150-year-old manuscript's cryptic handwriting and complex notations, Thoreau specialist Bradley P. Dean has performed a ""heroic feat of decipherment"" (Booklist) to bring this great work to light. Readers will discover ""passages that reach for the transcendentalist ideal of writing new Scriptures, yet grounding this Bible in a vision of practical ecology"" (Boston magazine). Wild Fruits is beautifully illustrated throughout with line drawings of the natural life Thoreau considered on his walks. - Back cover.

Its symbolism points to the paradox of the incarnation, death, and resurrection of God in Jesus of Nazareth, which St. Paul describes as a stumbling-block (skandalon). Yet the scandal of sacramentality, not only illustrated by but enacted in the Eucharist, has not been sufficiently accounted for in the ecclesiologies and sacramental theologies of the Christian tradition. Despite what appears to be an increasingly post-ecclesial world, sacrament remains a persistent theme in contemporary culture, often in places least expected. Drawing upon the biblical image of ""the Word made flesh"" this interdisciplinary study examines the scandal of sacramentality along the twofold thematic of the scandal of language (word) and the scandal of the body (flesh). While sacred theology can think through this scandal only at significant risk to its own stability, the fictional discourses of literature and the arts are free to explore this scandal in a manner that simultaneously augments and challenges traditional notions of sacrament and sacramentality, and by extension, what it means to describe the Church as a ""eucharistic community""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When we first met Johnnie Ray in the 1986 novel Blackbird--the first gay black coming-out novel ever published--he was a gay teenager in love with the star of a high school play; now he's forty-eight, still handsome and gym-built but admittedly vain and looking down the short road to fifty with some chagrin. In the midst of a midlife crisis, he falls for a much younger man with some serious Daddy issues; throughout it all, Johnnie Ray tries to look at love (and his life) from both sides now (to borrow a phrase from his idol, Joni Mitchell). Got 'til it's Gone is a queer romantic comedy for the twenty-first century.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But if she really was the love of his life, why had he never given her the one thing that would have made her life perfect? The ring she wore was not a wedding ring, and it did not bring her the security of marriage. That belonged, still, to Margaret, back in Newcastle where Richie had started off as a musician, before he became famous. Margaret and her son Scott never saw Richie, and had never met the three girls. They were his other family, not mentioned but always in Chrissie's mind, an obstacle to her complete happiness.And then, suddenly and shockingly, Richie is no longer there, and Chrissie and the girls have to learn to manage without him. The presence of the other family becomes, all at once, impossible to ignore – not least because they are involved in Richie's will. Old resentments, and feelings of abandonment and loss, have to jostle with the practicalities of money and property...   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ashley Dawson argues that during the past fifty years Asian and black intellectuals from Sam Selvon to Zadie Smith have continually challenged the United Kingdom’s exclusionary definitions of citizenship, using innovative forms of cultural expression to reconfigure definitions of belonging in the postcolonial age. By examining popular culture and exploring topics such as the nexus of race and gender, the growth of transnational politics, and the clash between first- and second-generation immigrants, Dawson broadens and enlivens the field of postcolonial studies.

This anthology provides a multifaceted historical and personal view of the Palmetto State. Thematically organized, this collection offers a geographic and emotional scope that is as diverse as its contributors. Sportswriters describe beloved arenas; historians reflect on church ruins and forts. A playwright recalls the magic of her first theater experience; a food writer revels in a coastal joint that serves fresh oysters. Backyards, front porches, a small library at a children's home, the drama and camaraderie of building the Savannah River Site, and places that are gone except in the memories of the writers who loved them--these are just a few of the locales covered, all showing how South Carolina has changed and inspired people in a variety of ways. State of the Heart evokes a sense of history and timelessness by bringing together heartfelt responses to South Carolina locales rooted in memory, drawing on reflection, inspiration, and love. The anthology reveals a state that is more than a playground for tourists; it's a state of human hiding places that echo in the hearts of its literary citizens. Though presented as a book about place, the collection is ultimately about our shared connections to one another, to a complex common past, and to ongoing efforts to frame and build a future of promise and possibility""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By representing the misreading of signifying systems - such as speech, gesture, writing, social structures and natural phenomena - Tacitus obliquely comments upon the perversion of Rome's republican structure in the new principate. Furthermore, this study argues that the distinctively obscure style of the Annals is used by Tacitus to draw his reader into the ambiguities and compromises of the political regime it represents. The strain on language and meaning both portrayed and enacted by the Annals in this way gives voice to a form of political protest to which the reader must respond in the course of interpreting the narrative.

While this has often been identified simply with nationalism, the book examines the connections, comparisons and contrasts between Irish republicanism and other strands of republican politics: the ideology and practice of official French republicanism, the broader European and American civic republican tradition and the contemporary revival of this tradition of citizenship.  Academics from different disciplines, along with statesmen and politicians from different political perspectives, are brought together to examine the relationship of historical and contemporary Irish republicanism to the wider republican theoretical tradition. The book analyses political positions among those parties describing themselves as republican in Ireland in the twenty-first century and examines the possible relevance of the ideas of the broader republican tradition for future politics in Ireland.

Ivor Willoughby, a young Orientalist, embarks on an ambitious quest to find his father, an officer abroad with the British Army. In all of Ivor's life, Robert has returned to England only once, bedraggled and wild-eyed with tales of As'ir, a land of Sheikhs and white-turbaned bandits, where he is fighting alongside Captain Lawrence and is known by the name 'Ullobi'. After that single meeting which left such a mark on his son, Robert is never heard from again. Ten years on, Ivor must find out what became of him. So he sets out on the journey of a lifetime. Travelling to Cairo to join the Locust Bureau, then circuitously to Abha, Yemen, and along the Red Sea coast, Ivor searches everywhere for clues about Ullobi, but no one appears to remember him. Or perhaps they are afraid to admit to it. Along the way Ivor hears whispers of a woman warrior called Na'ema who was once a slave. Her story seems tantalisingly connected with his father's, and Ivor finds himself in the misty heights of Ayinah looking for an Abyssinian seer who was carried on the same slave ship as Na'ema in 1914 and might unlock the mystery ...""--Publisher's description.

Potter|Language English|Pages 336,"Although millions know of Sherlock Holmes through the chronicles of his exploits written by Dr. Watson, it is only now that, owing to his recent death, the full biography and facts of his life can be brought before the public. This volume brings together for the first time every known fact that can be fully authenticated about the life of one of the world's most extraordinary men, and reveals much more about him that has not been heretofore generally known. From twenty years' research into every possible source, the author has written as definitive an account as could ever be assembled. Sherlock Holmes was born on January 6th, 1854, the third and last son of Siger and Violet Holmes, of North Riding, Yorkshire. He traveled widely on the continent as a boy, where he learned six languages. Displaying most unusual talents at an early age, he attended an English boarding school, and in 1872 entered Oxford. He soon decided to train himself to become a consulting detective, and before long he was starting to take cases. Except for a period when he was an actor, he pursued his chosen career thereafter and of course became famous after Dr. Watson started to write about him. This book reveals far more than Watson ever could, including the whole story of his running battle with the infamous Professor Moriarty, his dangerous brush with Jack with Ripper, his long association and love for Irene Adler, the question of his own son, and the story of his retirement, the writing of his great book, and the circumstances of his death. In short, this book contains everything that can be told about Holmes. It is a marvelous reconstruction from very scattered sources, and the amazing but always scrupulously accurate story of a great man.

He painted 66 magnificent can vases during the first two years he spent there and kept notes from which he later wrote Noa Noa—a journal recording his thoughts and impressions of that time.    Noa Noa—the most widely known of Gauguin's writings—is reproduced here from a rare early edition (1919), in a lucid translation capturing the artist's unpretentious style. Page after page reveals Gauguin's keen observations of Tahiti and its people, and his passionate struggle to achieve the inner harmony he expressed so profoundly on canvas. Gauguin's prose is as seductive as his paintings, filled with descriptions of warm seas, hidden lagoons, lush green forests, and beautiful Maori women.    The journal is captivating reading, offering a compelling autobiographical fragment of the soul of a genius and a rare glimpse of Oceanian culture. The brief periods of happiness Gauguin found among the Tahitians are eloquently expressed in his narrative. We understand the motives that drove him and gain a deeper appreciation of his art.    Today the manuscript provides unparalleled insight into Gauguin's thoughts as he strove to achieve spiritual peace, and into the wellsprings of a singular artistic style which changed the course of modern art. This wonderfully affordable edition—enhanced by 24 of Gauguin's South Seas drawings—makes a unique and passionate testament accessible to all art lovers.

Once there, Margaret did something unthinkable for an Englishwoman in the 1600s: she became an author in her own right.  Margaret published twenty-three volumes in all, starting with Poems and Fancies, the first book of English poetry published by a woman under her own name.  Among her better-known scientific and philosophical writing is also a science fiction novel, Blazing World, another indication she lived ahead of her time. Her critics were shocked, labeling her ""Mad Madge of Newcastle"" in an effort to taint her reputation for future generations.  Mad Madge is a satisfying, well-researched biography of a fascinating woman and a glimpse back in time to the cultural challenges of female writers.

But in a culture in which women shroud their faces and suicide is a grave taboo, to photograph these women is to dishonor--and perhaps endanger--them.  Maria and Imo must find their way among spies, arms dealers, and mercenaries, and through the back alleys of Kabul and into Pashtun villages, where the fragility of life stands out in bold relief.  Before the assignment is over, Maria will have to decide if it's more important to succeed at her work--and please Imo--or to follow her own moral compass.Stunningly evocative and richly observed, The End of Manners is a story of friendship and loyalty, of the transformative power of journeying outside oneself into the wider world.From the Hardcover edition.

Stupidity,Avital Ronell,literature,First published in 2002,/works/OL3910744W,/authors/OL711689A/Avital_Ronell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6776741M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  University of Illinois Press|Language English|Pages 366,"""There is something about stupidity that is untrackable; it evades our cognitive scanners and turns up as the uncanny double of mastery or intelligence."" ""The political and social implications of stupidity have been articulated by Marx, Nietzsche, Deleuze, among others. Urgent yet recalcitrant, stupidity provokes a crisis in our understanding of politics, ethics, and psychoanalysis. The dilemma posed by the limited subject involves national identity, masochism and sexual politics, as well as the relation of poetic utterance to the stammer in which it originates. Essentially linked to the philosophical primal scene of stupor, stupidity also points to what has been historically inappropriable, as when Hannah Arendt considers Eichmann in terms of not only the banality but also the stupidity of evil."" ""In Stupidity Avital Ronell explores the fading empire of cognition, modulating stupidity into idiocy, puerility, and the figure of the ridiculous philosopher instituted by Kant. Drawing on a range of writers including Dostoevsky, Schlegel, Musil, and Wordsworth, Stupidity investigates ignorance, dumbfoundedness, and the limits of reason, while probing the pervasive practice of theory-bashing and related forms of paranoid aggression. A section on prolonged and debilitating illness pushes the text to the edge of a corporeal hermeneutics, ""at the limits of what the body knows and tells.""""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Composed in 48 episodes, it recounts the daily life of Sanaaq, a strong and outspoken young widow, her daughter Qumaq, and their small semi-nomadic community in northern Quebec. Here they live their lives hunting seal, repairing their kayak, and gathering mussels under blue sea ice before the tide comes in. These are ordinary extraordinary lives: marriages are made and unmade, children are born and named, violence appears in the form of a fearful husband or a hungry polar bear. Here the spirit world is alive and relations with non-humans are never taken lightly. And under it all, the growing intrusion of the qallunaat and the battle for souls between the Catholic and Anglican missionaries threatens to forever change the way of life of Sanaaq and her young family.

The essays in this collection explore the significant intellectual, economic, political, pedagogical, and creative resonance of anthologies through all levels of academic life. They show that anthologies have consequences and are grounded in commitments. Striving to articulate these consequences and commitments is a priority in higher education today. Most of the contributors to this volume are editors of anthologies, and they draw on personal experiences to provide a rare glimpse into the economics and logic of anthology publication. Their essays illustrate the ways in which editing an anthology involves negotiation and compromise between intellectual ideal and realistic practice. On Anthologies includes discussion of a wide range of anthologies used and produced by teachers and scholars. Though the emphasis is on literature and theory anthologies, the insights in this volume speak to professionals in all areas of academic life.

In between writing Flashman novels, George MacDonald Fraser spent thirty years as an ""incurably star struck"" screenwriter, working with the likes of Steve McQueen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Cubby Broccoli, Burt Lancaster, Federico Fellini and Oliver Reed. Now he shares his recollections of those encounters, providing a fascinating glimpse behind the scenes. Far from starry-eyed where Tony Blair & Co are concerned, he looks back also to the Britain of his youth and castigates those responsible for its decline to ""a Third World country ... misruled by a typical Third World government, corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic"". Controversial, witty and revealing – or ""curmudgeonly"", ""reactionary"", ""undiluted spleen"", according to the critics – The Light's on at Signpost has struck a chord with a great section of the public. Perhaps, as one reader suggests, it should be ""hidden beneath the floorboards, before the Politically-Correct Thought Police come hammering at the door, demanding to confiscate any copies"".

But man's happiness is not identified with enjoyment! In such enjoyment the consumer-oriented man loses the full dimension of his humanity""), ""The Great Divine Trial,"" about the meaning of his near-assassination, ""The Christian Family in the Modern World,"" and ""Family Prayer.""

Yet for Jimmy Dean, the glory road will be winding and broken, littered with the detritus of exploded dreams and destroyed love, as it passes through the holiest cultural sites of postwar twentieth-century America -- the genius-and-drug pumped world of the Beats, the protected inner sanctum of Graceland, the darkest shadows of Camelot. The lives and futures of Kerouac, Sinatra, Elvis, and the Kennedys will all be touched by him -- yet perhaps none so deeply as the fragile sex goddess who will always be his greatest burden and true soul mate, a dazzling and tragically lost phenomenon named Marilyn -- as he moves toward an astonishing destiny that will reconfigure the world.Ingeniously blending historical fact with brilliant invention, The Rebel is a hip, fast, and mesmerizing ride through the fifties and sixties -- an unforgettable road trip across a nation with an American legend at the wheel.

As a translator she naturally addressed herself both to contemporary standards of translation within the university, but also to readers like herself. In Three Guineas she ranged herself among German scholars who used Antigone to critique European politics of the 1930s. Orlando outwits the censors with a strategy that focuses on Proust's untranslatable word. The Waves and The Years show her looking ahead to the problems of postcolonial society, where translation crosses borders. In this first in-depth study of Woolf and European languages and literatures, Emily Dalgarno opens up a rewarding new way of reading her prose""--  ""The need to change the structure of the English sentence in order better to meet the requirements of women writers is a constant theme in the work of Virginia Woolf. She wrote during a period when the goals of translation were undergoing fundamental changes that enlarged and facilitated that project. The British translator who was compelled to observe the ethnocentric standards of Greek translation in the university evolved within a few decades into a figure whose aim, in response to the demands of colonial readers, was to mediate between cultures. It is the argument of this book that although Woolf read translations to acquaint herself with the diverse cultures of the world, as a writer she quickly learned to use translation as a means to resist the tendency of the dominant language to control meaning, the first step to remodeling semantics and syntax""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From ""Broccoli"" to ""Borscht"" to ""Puffed Rice and Meatballs,"" each of these new stories invites us into the uniquely captivating private worlds of Vapnyar's Eastern European emigres. There's Nina, a recent arrival from Russia, for whom the colorful abundance of the vegetable markets in New York represents her own fresh hopes and dreams. . . Luda and Milena, who battle over a widower in their English class with competing recipes for cheese puffs, spinach pies, and meatballs . . . Sergey, who finds more comfort in the borscht made by a paid female companion than in her sexual ministrations. Each of the women and men who inhabit these witty, tender, and beautifully observed stories needs and longs for the taste and smell of home, wherever--and with whomever--that may turn out to be.Russian in its wit and in many of its rich details, but American in its insistence on the quest for personal happiness, however provisional and however high the cost, Broccoli and Other Tales of Food and Love masterfully illuminates a very particular facet of desire with entirely charming results.From the Hardcover edition.

Thirty years later, Helmer moves his invalid father upstairs to have him out of the way. Soon after, Riet, once engaged to marry Helmer's twin, appears and asks if she and her troubled eighteen-year-old son could come to live with them on the farm. Ostensibly a novel about the canals, the green fields, and the unrelenting flatness of the Dutch countryside, The Twin ultimately opens itself to the possibility or impossibility of taking life into one's own hands. It chronicles a way of life that has resisted modernity and is culturally apart, yet is riven with longing.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Assisted, or hampered, by his ' Watson '— the insufferably precocious schoolboy, Rupert Priggley—he succeeds in unmasking the perpetrator of what had seemed to be the ' perfect' murder. Everyone knew there had been a murder, but everyone knew who the murderer was, and when this murderer committed suicide by jumping overboard—or was he thrown overboard ?—from the cargo boat Saragossa as she sailed to London from the North African and Spanish ports, they thought ' Good riddance to bad rubbish ', and everyone, the Police included, dropped the case. Everyone but Carolus Deene.  The fast-moving scenes are set in Newminster, 36 miles from London, in Tangier, in Spain, on board the Saragossa. Humour, as always with the cases of Carolus Deene, is there in plenty ; gems of character—even for Leo Bruce—are created in Socker, the lecherous gamekeeper, and the tall, thin but masterly Mrs Hoppy who never lets anyone finish a question . . . But in Dead Man's Shoes the humour is subsidiary to the excitement. This is an edge-of-the-chair whodunit.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

She walked with the easy spring that comes from a perfectly arched foot. To-day she swept swiftly down Marais Street, casting a quick glance here and there from under her heavy veil as if she feared she was being followed. If you had peered under the veil, you would have seen that Manuela's dark eyes were swollen and discoloured about the lids, as though they had known a sleepless, tearful night.   There had been a picnic the day before, and as merry a crowd of giddy, chattering Creole girls and boys as ever you could see boarded the ramshackle dummy-train that puffed its way wheezily out wide Elysian Fields Street, around the lily-covered bayous, to Milneburg-on-the-Lake. Now, a picnic at Milneburg is a thing to be remembered for ever. One charters a rickety-looking, weather-beaten dancing-pavilion, built over the water, and after storing the children - for your true Creole never leaves the small folks at home - and the baskets and mothers downstairs, the young folks go up-stairs and dance to the tune of the best band you ever heard. For what can equal the music of a violin, a guitar, a cornet, and a bass viol to trip the quadrille to at a picnic?   Then  one can fish in the lake and go bathing under the prim bath-houses, so severely separated sexually, and go rowing on the lake in a trim boat, followed by the shrill warnings of anxious mamans. And in the evening one comes home, hat crowned with cool gray Spanish moss, hands burdened with fantastic latanier baskets woven by the brown bayou boys, hand in hand with your dearest one, tired but happy.

Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work, exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward ""the peculiar institution"" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families ""sold down the river.""

Indeed, it would be a singular thing if it was found, unless some special business or direction led to it. For clearly it was never intended that human beings should build homes where these cottages cling together, between sea and sky, - a few here, and a few there, hidden away in every bend of the rocks where a little ground could be levelled, so that the tides in stormy weather break with threat and fury on the very doorstones of the lowest cottages. Yet as the lofty semicircle of hills bend inward, the sea follows; and there is a fair harbour, where the fishing boats ride together while their sails dry in the afternoon sun. Then the hamlet is very still; for the men are sleeping off the weariness of their night work, while the children play quietly among the tangle, and the women mend the nets or bait the lines for the next fishing. A lonely little spot, shut in by sea and land, and yet life is there in all its passionate variety - love and hate, jealousy and avarice, youth, with its ideal sorrows and infinite expectations, age, with its memories and regrets, and ""sure and certain hope.""

The sexton, Savely Gykin, was lying in his huge bed in the hut adjoining the church. He was not asleep, though it was his habit to go to sleep at the same time as the hens. His coarse red hair peeped from under one end of the greasy patchwork quilt, made up of coloured rags, while his big unwashed feet stuck out from the other. He was listening. His hut adjoined the wall that encircled the church and the solitary window in it looked out upon the open country. And out there a regular battle was going on. It was hard to say who was being wiped off the face of the earth, and for the sake of whose destruction nature was being churned up into such a ferment; but, judging from the unceasing malignant roar, someone was getting it very hot. A victorious force was in full chase over the fields, storming in the forest and on the church roof, battering spitefully with its fists upon the windows, raging and tearing, while something vanquished was howling and wailing. . . . A plaintive lament sobbed at the window, on the roof, or in the stove. It sounded not like a call for help, but like a cry of misery, a consciousness that it was too late, that there was no salvation. The snowdrifts were covered with a thin coating of ice; tears quivered on them and on the trees; a dark slush of mud and melting snow flowed along the roads and paths. In short, it was thawing, but through the dark night the heavens failed to see it, and flung flakes of fresh snow upon the melting earth at a terrific rate. And the wind staggered like a drunkard. It would not let the snow settle on the ground, and whirled it round in the darkness at random.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent. Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is illustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion, which belongs to it, in appropriate events. But the thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preexist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances predominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time. A man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts. The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the manifold world.

A rider had just left her and it was his message that held her thoughtful and almost sad, awaiting the churchmen who were coming to resent and attack her right to befriend a Gentile. She wondered if the unrest and strife that had lately come to the little village of Cottonwoods was to in-volve her. And then she sighed, remembering that her father had founded this remotest border settlement of southern Utah and that he had left it to her. She owned all the ground and many of the cottages. Withersteen House was hers, and the great ranch, with its thousands of cattle, and the swiftest horses of the sage. To her belonged Amber Spring, the water which gave verdure and beauty to the village and made living possible on that wild purple upland waste. She could not escape being involved by whatever befell Cottonwoods.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Two of our greatest interpreters proclaimed it, Emerson and William James. In a recent address at the Paris Sorbonne on ""American Idealism,"" M. Firmin Roz observed that a people is rarely justly estimated by its contemporaries. The French, he says, have been celebrated chiefly for the skill of their chefs and their vaudeville actors, while in the disturbed 'speculum mundi' Americans have appeared as a collection of money grabbers whose philosophy is the dollar. It remained for the war to reveal the true nature of both peoples. The American colonists, M. Roz continues, unlike other colonists, were animated not by material motives, but by the desire to safeguard and realize an ideal; our inherent characteristic today is a belief in the virtue and power of ideas, of a national, indeed, of a universal, mission. In the Eighteenth Century we proposed a Philosophy and adopted a Constitution far in advance of the political practice of the day, and set up a government of which Europe predicted the early downfall. Nevertheless, thanks partly to good fortune, and to the farseeing wisdom of our early statesmen who perceived that the success of our experiment depended upon the maintenance of an isolation from European affairs, we established democracy as a practical form of government.

Mr. Gray said it would begin promptly at three.      ""I'm doing my best, Gus. This crutch -"" ""I know. Climb aboard, old scout, and we'll go along faster."" The first speaker, a lad of fifteen, large for his age, fair-haired, though as brown as a berry and athletic in all his easy, deliberate yet energetic movements, turned to the one he had called Bill, a boy of about his own age, or a little older, but altogether opposite in appearance, for he was undersized, dark-haired, black-eyed, and though a life-long cripple with a twisted knee, as quick and nervous in action as the limitations of his physical strength and his ever-present crutch permitted.      In another moment, despite the protests of generous consideration for his chum's strenuous offer, William Brown was heaved up on the broad back of Augustus Grier and the two cronies thus progressed quite rapidly for a full quarter of a mile through the residential section of Fairview. Not until the pair arrived at the entrance of one of the outlying cottages did husky Gus cease to be the beast of burden, though he was greatly tempted to turn into a charging war horse when one of a group of urchins on a street corner shouted:     ""Look at the monkey on a mule!""

The gentleman, then battling with a fatal malady, took from his library shelf a translation of the Upanishads and, opening it, expressed deep regret that the obscure and unfamiliar form shut from him what he felt to be profound and vital teaching.  The desire to unlock the closed doors of this ancient treasure house, awakened at that time, led to a series of classes on the Upanishads at The Vedanta Centre of Boston during its early days in St. Botolph Street. The translation and commentary then given were trans-cribed and, after studious revision, were published in the Centre's monthly magazine, ""The Message of the East,"" in 1913 and 1914..

Such verse must inevitably forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit, literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind, like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her lifetime, three or four poems. Yet she wrote verses in great abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own, and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own tenacious fastidiousness.

He was born sixty-two years ago on the Illinois prairie, and he has devoted practically all of his life to the pursuit of wild animals. It has been a pursuit which owed its unflagging energy and indomitable purpose to a singular passion, almost an obsession, to capture alive, not to kill. He has caught and broken the will of every well-known wild beast native to western North America. Killing was repulsive to him. He even disliked the sight of a sporting rifle, though for years necessity compelled him to earn his livelihood by supplying the meat of buffalo to the caravans crossing the plains. At last, seeing that the extinction of the noble beasts was inevitable, he smashed his rifle over a wagon wheel and vowed to save the species. For ten years he labored, pursuing, capturing and taming buffalo, for which the West gave him fame, and the name Preserver of the American Bison.

Shunted off to an isolated boarding school, with his father's activities abroad and the source of his newfound wealth grown increasingly mysterious, Xeno turns his early fascination with animals into a personal obsession: his search for the Caravan Bestiary.  This medieval text, lost for eight hundred years, supposedly details the animals not granted passage on the Ark--griffins, hippogriffs, manticores, and basilisks--the vanished remnants of a lost world sometimes glimpsed in the shadowy recesses of our own.Xeno's quest takes him from the tenements of New York to the jungles of Vietnam to the ancient libraries of Europe--but it is only by riddling out his own family secrets that he can hope to find what he is looking for.  A story of panoramic scope and intellectual suspense, The Bestiary is ultimately a tale of heartbreak and redemption.From the Hardcover edition.

The bewildered, the helpless - and there are many - are torn from the parent rock, crushed, rolled smooth, and left stranded in strange places. Thus was Edward Bumpus severed and rolled from the ancestral ledge, from the firm granite of seemingly stable and lasting things, into shifting shale; surrounded by fragments of cliffs from distant lands he had never seen. Thus, at five and fifty, he found himself gate-keeper of the leviathan Chippering Mill in the city of Hampton.  That the polyglot, smoky settlement sprawling on both sides of an historic river should be a part of his native New England seemed at times to be a hideous dream; nor could he comprehend what had happened to him, and to the world of order and standards and religious sanctions into which he had been born. His had been a life of relinquishments. For a long time he had clung to the institution he had been taught to believe was the rock of ages, the Congregational Church, finally to abandon it; even that assuming a form fantastic and unreal, as embodied in the edifice three blocks distant from Fillmore Street which he had attended for a brief time, some ten years before, after his arrival in Hampton. The building, indeed, was symbolic of a decadent and bewildered Puritanism in its pathetic attempt to keep abreast with the age, to compromise with anarchy, merely achieving a nondescript medley of rounded, knob-like towers covered with mulberry-stained shingles. And the minister was sensational and dramatic. He looked like an actor, he aroused in Edward Bumpus an inherent prejudice that condemned the stage. Half a block from this tabernacle stood a Roman Catholic Church, prosperous, brazen, serene, flaunting an eternal permanence amidst the chaos which had succeeded permanence!

"The Dwelling-Place of Light, Vol 2",Winston Churchill,literature,First published in 2004,/works/OL2341836W,/authors/OL316976A/Winston_Churchill,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8881765M-M.jpg,"Publish Date February 20, 2006|Publisher  1st World Library - Literary Society|Language English|Pages 176","From the book:At certain moments during the days that followed the degree of tension her relationship with Ditmar had achieved tested the limits of Janet's ingenuity and powers of resistance. Yet the sense of mastery at being able to hold such a man in leash was by no means unpleasurable to a young woman of her vitality and spirit. There was always the excitement that the leash might break - and then what? Here was a situation, she knew instinctively, that could not last, one fraught with all sorts of possibilities, intoxicating or abhorrent to contemplate; and for that very reason fascinating. When she was away from Ditmar and tried to think about it she fell into an abject perplexity, so full was it of anomalies and contradictions, of conflicting impulses; so far beyond her knowledge and experience. For Janet had been born in an age which is rapidly discarding blanket morality and taboos, which has as yet to achieve the morality of scientific knowledge, of the individual instance. Tradition, convention, the awful examples portrayed for gain in the movies, even her mother's pessimistic attitude in regard to the freedom with which the sexes mingle to-day were powerless to influence her. The thought, however, that she might fundamentally resemble her sister Lise, despite a fancied superiority, did occasionally shake her and bring about a revulsion against Ditmar. Janet's problem was in truth, though she failed so to specialize it, the supreme problem of our time: what is the path to self-realization? how achieve emancipation from the commonplace?

Yosano Akiko and The Tale of Genji,Gaye Rowley,literature,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501475W,/authors/OL8909176A/Gaye_Rowley,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  University of Michigan Press|Pages 235,"Yosano Akiko (1878–1942) has long been recognized as one of the most important literary figures of prewar Japan. Her renown derives principally from the passion of her early poetry and from her contributions to 20th-century debates about women. This emphasis obscures a major part of her career, which was devoted to work on the Japanese classics and, in particular, the great Heian period text The Tale of Genji. Akiko herself felt that Genji was the bedrock upon which her entire literary career was built, and her bibliography shows a steadily increasing amount of time devoted to projects related to the tale. This study traces for the first time the full range of Akiko’s involvement with The Tale of Genji.  The Tale of Genji provided Akiko with her conception of herself as a writer and inspired many of her most significant literary projects. She, in turn, refurbished the tale as a modern novel, pioneered some of the most promising avenues of modern academic research on Genji, and, to a great extent, gave the text the prominence it now enjoys as a translated classic. Through Akiko’s work Genji became, in fact as well as in name, an exemplum of that most modern of literary genres, the novel. In delineating this important aspect of Akiko’s life and her bibliography, this study aims to show that facile descriptions of Akiko as a “poetess of passion” or “new woman” will no longer suffice.

A large portion of Hampton Common is black with the people of sixteen nationalities who have gathered there, trampling down the snow, to listen wistfully and eagerly to a new doctrine of salvation. In the centre of this throng on the bandstand - reminiscent of concerts on sultry, summer nights - are the itinerant apostles of the cult called Syndicalism, exhorting by turns in divers tongues. Antonelli had spoken, and many others, when Janet, impelled by a craving not to be denied, had managed to push her way little by little from the outskirts of the crowd until now she stood almost beneath the orator who poured forth passionate words in a language she recognized as Italian. Her curiosity was aroused, she was unable to classify this tall man whose long and narrow face was accentuated by a pointed brown beard, whose lips gleamed red as he spoke, whose slim hands were eloquent. The artist as propagandist - the unsuccessful artist with more facility than will. The nose was classic, and wanted strength; the restless eyes that at times seemed fixed on her were smouldering windows of a burning house: the fire that stirred her was also consuming him. Though he could have been little more than five and thirty, his hair was thinned and greying at the temples. And somehow emblematic of this physiognomy and physique, summing it up and expressing it in terms of apparel, were the soft collar and black scarf tied in a flowing bow. Janet longed to know what he was saying. His phrases, like music, played on her emotions, and at last, when his voice rose in crescendo at the climax of his speech, she felt like weeping.

Canberra has been wiped out in a nuclear attack. There is a permanent state of emergency. Security checkpoints, citizenship tests, identity cards and detention without trial have all become the norm. Suspect minorities have been locked away into ghettos. And worse - no one wants to play cricket with us anymore.Enter Leo James - burnt out property developer and black-sheep twin brother of the all powerful Bernard James, Prime Minister of Australia. In an event all too typical of the times, Leo finds himself abducted by terrorists. But this won't be your average kidnapping. Instead, vast and secret forces are at work here, and Leo and his captors are about to embark on a journey into the underworld of a nation gone mad.Like some bastard child of Dr Strangelove and George Orwell, Underground is both an adrenalin-pumped thriller and a gleefully barbed satire that takes a chainsaw to political neo-correctness and Australia's new ultra-nationalism.

They are nodal points, places where vast areas of thought and feeling gathered and dispersed, creating a nation as various and vibrant as the United States, which must be considered one of the most successful nation-states in modern history, and a republic built firmly on ideas, which are contained in its major texts. Where we have been must, of course, determine where we are going. My hope is that this book helps to show us where we have been and engenders a lively conversation about our destination, which seems perpetually in dispute."" --from Promised LandAmericans need periodic reminding that they are, to a great extent, people of the book--or, rather, books. In Promised Land, Jay Parini repossesses that vibrant, intellectual heritage by examining the life and times of thirteen ""books that changed America."" Each of the books has been a watershed, gathering intellectual currents already in motion and marking a turn in American life and thought. Their influence remains pervasive, however hidden, and in his essays Jay Parini demonstrates how these books entered American life and altered how we think and act in the world. The thirteen ""books that changed America"": Of Plymouth Plantation - The Federalist Papers - The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin - The Journals of Lewis and Clark - Walden - Uncle Tom's Cabin - Adventures of Huckleberry Finn - The Souls of Black Folk - The Promised Land - How to Win Friends and Influence People - The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care - On the Road - The Feminine Mystique Promised Land offers a reading of the American psyche, allowing us to reflect on what our past means for who we are now.

Society is everywhere in crisis as his own family is torn apart by mental illness and the Vietnam War. From the last of the old outlaws to hippies in psychedelic school buses, from Hispanic rebellion to apocalyptic physicists who embrace the bomb, everyone is in conflict; and the world around him is literally on the verge of burning down. Through it all, Byrd must not only survive but also find his way toward a lasting freedom.     About the Author    Brent Hightower grew up in Placitas, New Mexico, in the 1960s, in a family of scientists and teachers. His extended family was deeply divided by the Vietnam War and steeped in the destructive legacy of the Irish diaspora. The spiritual, intellectual, and psychological chaos of his upbringing and a painstaking effort of reconstruction have defined his life.

These decades saw the emergence of a group of talented Irish writers who developed and advanced such innovative forms as the national tale and the historical novel: fictions that took Ireland as their topic and setting and which often imagined its history via domestic plots that addressed wider issues of dispossession and inheritance. Their openness to contemporary politics, as well as to recent historiography, antiquarian scholarship, poetry, song, plays and memoirs, produced a series of notable fictions; marked most of all by their ability to fashion from these resources a new vocabulary of cultural identity. This book extends and enriches the current understanding of Irish Romanticism, blending sympathetic textual analysis of the fiction with careful historical contextualization""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Never Love a Stranger tells the gritty and passionate tale of Francis ""Frankie"" Kane, from his meager beginnings as an orphan in New York's Hell's Kitchen. From that confused and belittling start, Frank works his way up, choosing the wrong side of the law to make a name for himself. At a young age, he becomes one of the city's most dangerous men, indulging in his passion for power, sex, and the best things in life-whether or not they can be purchased.  First published in 1948, the novel began Robbins' prolific career after someone made him a $100 bet that he couldn't write a bestseller. Twenty-six pot-boiling novels later, he proved the power of his words. Never Love a Stranger takes an unflinching look at a New York that's long gone by-exposing life during and after the Great Depression, when the syndicate ruled the city without mercy.--Goodreads   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Basing his story on careful research and personal observation, Greiner recounts the lives of the Tanana River Valley wolf pack and the tough, lonely hunter, Jake, who inhabits their valley. In splendid detail, he describes the birth of pups, the victory of the hunt, and the habits of animals who share the wolves' valley. Yet in describing the beauty, he never forgets the harshness of the Arctic wilderness; Greiner makes the ugly realities of the fight for survival intensely clear.  Feb 09, 2018 Goodreads member: Cienna Lyon liked it 3 of 5 stars.    This book shows its age, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The book was written in the 1980's, but I assume it is set in an earlier time due to certain aspects of the story. The natural aspect of this is absolutely amazing. The entire book has no dialogue, and is simply a day by day descriptions of a wolf pack's life as well as the animals that interact with them.  If you don't enjoy animal behavior or detailed descriptions of nature it probably isn't for you, as the prose can be lengthy and sometimes over detailed or boring. The only aspect I genuinely didn't like was the human interaction with the wolf. I think we're meant to care about Tatum, a trapper living in Alaskan wilderness and this is where the age of the book really shows.  SPOILERS: The trapper seeks revenge against the wolf pack because he hates wolves, they chewed up his snowmobile seat and very late in the book one of the wolves kills his dog (something they would very rarely do in reality). So in retaliation he traps 3 of them in snares and foot traps, which is horrid and many other animals fall prey to this and later he decimates all but two of the wolves by airplane. Honestly this was so hard to read and I don't understand why a good book was ruined by this addition. My only complaint, but it makes me like the book a lot less.

When Hecker, mentally retreating into the sanctuary of his faux medieval world, sells the family home and goes on a pilgrimage across modern Europe to find his son, using the cover of the 900th birthday celebrations of St Hildegard von Bingen, his resulting dislocation and descent into chaos is both fantastically funny and incredibly moving.

But there has been no literary biography written this century, and previous books have ignored the real person--what she actually thought and felt and why she did what she did--despite the fact that Mary and her group of second-generation Romantics were extremely interested in the psychological aspect of life. In this probing narrative, Fiona Sampson pursues Mary Shelley through her turbulent life, much as Victor Frankenstein tracked his monster across the arctic wastes. Sampson has written a book that finally answers the question of how it was that a nineteen-year-old came to write a novel so dark, mysterious, anguished, and psychologically astute that it continues to resonate two centuries later. No previous biographer has ever truly considered this question, let alone answered it.  We know the facts of Mary Shelley's life in some detail, but previous books have ignored the real person-- what she actually thought and felt and why she did what she did. Sampson pursues Mary Shelley through her turbulent life, and answers the question of how it was that a nineteen-year-old came to write a novel so dark, mysterious, anguished, and psychologically astute that it continues to resonate two centuries later. -- adapted from jacket.

The politics of age and disability in contemporary Spanish film,Matthew J.

Applying a dual lens of film analysis and theory drawn from the allied fields of youth, age, and disability studies, this study is set both within and against a conversation on cultural diversity--with respect to gender, sexual, and ethnic identity--which has driven not only much of the past decade's most visible and fruitful scholarship on representation in Spanish film, but also the broader parameters of discourse on post--Transition Spain in the humanities. Presenting an engaging, and heretofore under-explored, interdisciplinary approach to images of multiculturalism in what has emerged as one of recent Spain's most vibrant areas of cultural production, this book brings a fresh, while still complementary, critical sensibility to the field of contemporary Peninsular film studies through its detailed discussion of six contemporary films (by Salvador García Ruiz, Achero Mañas, Santiago Aguilar & Luis Guridi, Marcos Carnevale, Alejandro Amenábar, and Pedro Almodóvar) and supporting reference to the production of other prominent and emerging filmmakers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They created a series of brilliant and varied fictions for human connection, as often antagonistic as sympathetic, using these as a means for individuals to assert themselves in the face of social domination. Whilst the fantasy of equal and permanent friendship shaped their thinking, dramatists used friendship most effectively as a way of shaping individuality and its limitations. Dealing with a wide range of ShakespeareCfUs plays and poems, and with many works of his contemporaries, this study gives readers a deeper insight into a crucial aspect of ShakespeareCfUs culture and his use of it in art.

P. Tarcher/Penguin|Language English|Pages 332,"By the early 1920s, Americans were discovering that the world was a strange place. Charles Fort could demonstrate that it was even stranger than anyone suspected. Frogs fell from the sky. Blood rained from the heavens. Mysterious airships visited the Earth. Dogs talked. People disappeared. Fort asked why, but, even more vexing, he also asked why we weren't paying attention. Here is the first fully rendered literary biography of the man who, more than any other figure, would define our idea of the anomalous and paranormal. In Charles Fort: The Man Who Invented the Supernatural, the acclaimed historian of stage magic Jim Steinmeyer goes deeply into the life of Charles Fort as he saw himself: first and foremost, a writer. At the same time, Steinmeyer tells the story of an era in which the certainties of religion and science were being turned on their heads. And of how Fort ""significantly"" was the first man who challenged those orthodoxies not on the grounds of some counter-fundamentalism of his own but simply for the plainest of reasons: they didn't work. In so doing, Fort gave voice to a generation of doubters who would neither accept the ""straight story"" of scholastic science nor credulously embrace fantastical visions. Instead, Charles Fort demanded of his readers and admirers the most radical of human acts: Thinking.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After local prejudice and the family's own emotional frailty result in unspeakable tragedy, the gravedigger's daughter, Rebecca, begins her astonishing pilgrimage into America, an odyssey of erotic risk and imaginative daring, ingenious self-invention, and, in the end, a bittersweet—but very ""American""—triumph.

The book juxtaposes works by one female and one male author in each of the eight chapters, surveying literature beginning in the often-ignored Spanish Enlightenment, continuing to the nineteenth century of Romanticism and Realism, and ending in the early twentieth century of Modernism. The concept of modernity in Spain is explored from various vantage points including those of philosophical, theological, psychoanalytic, and sociological theorists as well as socio-historic contexts. Influential female and male writers of Spain demonstrate how disillusion in the face of modernity varies according to gender in a process of 'gendered disillusion.'

It is impossible not to be held spellbound by the way she forces us to think, hard, about right and wrong.' - Washington Post Jacob Hunt is a teenage boy with Asperger's Syndrome. He's hopeless at reading social cues or expressing himself to others, and like many children with Asperger's, Jacob has an obsessive focus on one subject-in his case, forensic analysis. He's always showing up at crime scenes, thanks to the police scanner he keeps in his room, and telling the cops what they need to do-and he's usually right. But then one day his tutor is found dead, and the police come to question him. Reluctance to make eye contact, stimulatory tics and twitches, inappropriate gestures, all these can look a lot like guilt. Suddenly, Jacob finds himself accused of murder.House Rules looks at what it means to be different in our society, and at the extremes of love and loyalty a family must call upon to help each other overcome impossible circumstances.

Margaret's mother calls the match ""a piece of luck.""Margaret is a good girl who has been raised to marry, yet Andrew confounds her expectations from the moment their train leaves for his naval base in faraway California. Soon she comes to understand that his devotion to science leaves precious little room for anything, or anyone, else. When personal tragedies strike and when national crises envelop the country, Margaret stands by her husband. But as World War II approaches, Andrew's obsessions take a different, darker turn, and Margaret is forced to reconsider the life she has so carefully constructed.Private Life is a beautiful evocation of a woman's inner world: of the little girl within the hopeful bride, of the young woman filled with yearning, and of the faithful wife who comes to harbor a dangerous secret. But it is also a heartbreaking portrait of marriage and the mysteries that endure even in lives lived side by side; a wondrously evocative historical panorama; and, above all, a masterly, unforgettable novel from one of our finest storytellers.From the Hardcover edition.

Defective Inspectors: Crime-fiction Pastiche in Late Twentieth-century French Literature (Legenda Main Series) (Legenda Main Series),Simon Kemp,literature,First published in 2006,/works/OL3254898W,/authors/OL530266A/Simon_Kemp,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8771323M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 30, 2006|Publisher  Legenda|Language English|Pages 165","Crime fiction is a popular target for literary pastiche in France. From the nouveau roman and the Oulipo group to the current avant-garde, writers have seized on the genre to exploit it for their own ends, toying with its traditional plots and characters, and exploring its preoccupations with perception, reason and truth. In the first full-length study of the phenomenon, Simon Kemp's investigation centres on four major writers of the twentieth century, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Georges Perec and Jean Echenoz. Out of their varied encounters with the genre, from deconstruction of the classic detective story to homage to the roman noir, Kemp elucidates the complex relationship between the pasticheur and his target, which demands an entirely new assessment of pastiche as a literary form.

Coetzee is one of the most intriguing of authors in all of world literature. Now, in J.M. Coetzee and the Life of Writing, David Attwell illuminates the extraordinary creative processes behind Coetzee's novels from Dusklands to The Childhood of Jesus. Using Coetzee's manuscripts, notebooks and research papers - recently deposited at the Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin - Attwell produces a fascinating story of the creative trajectory and the life out of which the fiction was engendered. He shows convincingly that all of Coetzee's work is autobiographical, the memoirs being continuous with the fictions, and that his writing proceeds with self-conscious and never-ending reflection. This is a moving and readable account which is bound to change the way Coetzee is read, by the critics and general reader alike""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

U prvom talasu našeg posleratnog pesništva taj tok je bio u samom temelju obnove, da bi danas bio gotovo potisnut.  Izgleda da se upravo danas, u atmosferi gotovo pune zasićenosti praksom smenjivanja pesničkih trendova, srpsko pesništvo opet vraća svojim temeljnim tokovima. Ova slika laganog preokreta, jedne dugo očekivane preorijentacije na našoj pesničkoj sceni, po svemu sudeći već se događa i već se oseća u aktuelnoj knjizevnoj atmosferi. Iščitavanje pesničkog rukopisa Dejana Stojanovića ""Krugovanje"", izaziva asocijacije jednog ovakvog talasa koji nije vise u ilegali, nego se pretvara u aktuelan pesnički fenomen. Dejan Stojanović očigledno ne trpi uticaj nijedne škole savremenog pevanja, nije se poveo ni za jednim pomodnim pesničkim trendom, niti je upao u makaze nekog senzibiliteta, kao ""pratilac"". Reč je o pesniku iskazne i misaone zrelosti, izrazito refleksivnom, neretko diskurzivnom, sa stihom koji vec u prvom sloju oživljava atmosferu klasične starine. Lako je uočljivo šta Stojanovića posebno obeležava u kontekstu savremenih pesničkih strujanja. U tkanju pesme i građenju stiha pesnik se vratio antičkoj formi iskaza, teškom i sporom hodu iskazne građe, tonu dostojanstvenom i gotovo svečanom, i onoj vrsti mudrovanja u stihu koje se negovalo u antička vremena. Taj antički ton, sasvim u sazvučju i atmosferi klasične starine, a koji u savremenom kontekstu odjekuje sasvim moderno, izbija iz gotovo svake Stojanovićeve pesme i daje ton celoj knjizi.  Daleko od eksperimenata, od iskušenja hazarda i pesničkog pustolovlja, Stojanovićeve pesme odisu dostojanstvom antičkih formi. Slično postupku slikara, Stojanović svoje guste iskaze, najčesce mediteranski kolorisane, kondenzuje u kratke, harmonicne celine, iznenađujuće uspešnosti. Njegove pesme su, po pravilu, kondenzovane forme, satkane od sažetih iskaza. U drugom delu knjige pesnicka paleta kao da se zamračuje, pojavljuju se elementi fantastičnog i halucinantnog, pa i apokaliptički tonovi. Međutim, načelo kondenzacije i konzistentnost forme kod Stojanovića nikada ne dolaze u pitanje. Apokaliptičke scene i slike zla prikazuju se u krupnim blokovima, koji deluju poput krupnih poteza kakvog arhitekte ili skulptora. Takve su pesme ""Vizija"", ""Šahovska tabla"", ""Dolazak mraka"", ""Gutačica"", koje sve odreda deluju kao kompozicije. Stiče se utisak da je Dejan Stojanović pojedine pesme pisao uz likovne kompozicije: do te mere su u njima vizuelno-imaginativni efekti impresivni.  Pravo je čudo da Dejan Stojanović nije do sada uspeo da svoje pesništvo uspešnije eksponira na javnoj sceni savremene srpske poezije. Specifičan, iznenađujuće originalan, izvan tokova kolektivno negovanih senzibiliteta i pomodnih trendova, Stojanović je izrazit primer stvaralačkog individualizma u generaciji koja je taj individualizam najmanje negovala. Zato je njegova knjiga ""Krugovanje"" ne samo primer izrazitog pesničkog dometa, koji predstavlja snažan prilog i podsticaj izuzetno značajnom toku našeg pesništva, nego i objava jednog moralnog i duhovnog projekta. Projekta koji pripada tradiciji srpske duhovnosti u najboljem i najizvornijem smislu te reči.  -Alek Vukadinović, 1986.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Cursed with health problems and drawn into trouble more often than not, Tommy is the recipient of pity rather than admiration. He is nothing like his stepbrother Eric.  Eric, a Nordic Adonis, is graced by a seemingly endless supply of good fortune-he is charming, a star athlete, and a magnet for anyone in his sphere. Yet in spite of these differences, Eric and Tommy are as close as two humans can be. After tragedy rips their makeshift family apart, the lives of these boys split. In a powerful story of modern-day resilience and redemption, Tommy and Eric forge their separate ways in the world, each confronting the challenges of his sphere. For Tommy this means dropping out of school, selling drugs, living on the streets, and somehow creating a family of his own. Motherless, African-American, and impoverished, Tommy has nothing but feels lucky every day of his life. For Eric, the golden youth, life means athletics, sexual attraction, excellent grades, prosperity, and the uncertainty that comes with prizes won too easily. Given everything, he trusts nothing. Eric and Tommy's parallel lives are an astonishing story of self-determination and the true measure of fortune. The ties that bind this Adonis and his sickly counterpart, however, are thicker than blood, and when circumstances reunite Eric and Tommy after years apart, their distinct approaches to life may be the only thing that can save them from forces that threaten to destroy them for good. Written with unique insight into the hidden currents and deeper realities of modern life, Fortunate Son is a tour de force by the author the Boston Globe calls ""one of this nation's finest writers.""

As the junior member of her father's law firm, young and ambitious lawyer Amanda Jaffe becomes closely involved with the case and its participants: the surgeon's beautiful wife; an overzealous detective; a brutal mobster, and a vituperative hospital administrator. When evidence amassed against the surgeon is overturned due to procedural misconduct, the surgeon disappears, seemingly confirming suspicions about his guilt. But then a second series of murders is discovered, revealing a pattern identical to the first. Is the surgeon back, carrying out his crimes incognito? Or is there a copy-cat killer? Amanda Jaffe's quest for the truth places her squarely in the middle of a story of murder and revenge of epic preportions, in a thriller whose pace and unexpected twists and turns will leave readers gasping for breath, and guessing till the very end.

The great beasts, as they circle one another, shaking the trees and trumpeting loudly, are the Amerikanos and the Japanese as they fight. And our Philippine Islands? We are the small chickens.""Once in a great while comes a storyteller who can illuminate worlds large and small, magical and true to life. When the Elephants Dance introduces us to the incandescent voice of Tess Uriza Holthe, who sets her remarkable first novel in the waning days of World War II, as the Japanese and the Americans engage in a fierce battle for possession of the Philippine Islands. The Karangalan family and their neighbors huddle for survival in the cellar of a house a few miles from Manila. Outside the safety of their little refuge the war rages on--fiery bombs torch the beautiful Filipino countryside, Japanese soldiers round up and interrogate innocent people, and from the hills guerillas wage a desperate campaign against the enemy. Inside the  cellar, these men, women, and children put their hopes and dreams on hold as they wait out the war, only emerging to look for food, water, and medicine. Through the eyes of three narrators, thirteen-year-old Alejandro Karangalan, his spirited older sister Isabelle, and Domingo, a passionate guerilla commander, we see how ordinary people must learn to live in the midst of extraordinary uncertainty, how they must find hope for survival where none seems to exist. They find this hope in the dramatic history of the Philippine Islands and the passion and bravery of its people. Crowded together in the cellar, the Karangalans and their friends and neighbors tell magical stories to one another based on Filipino myth and legend to fuel their courage, pass the time, and teach important lessons. The group is held spellbound by these stories, which feature a dazzling array of ghosts, witches, supernatural creatures, and courageous Filipinos who changed the course of history with their actions. These profoundly moving stories transport the listeners from the chaos of the war around them and give them new resolve to fight on.With When the Elephants Dance Holthe has not only written a gripping narrative of how Alejandro, Isabelle, Domingo and their community fight for survival, but a loving tribute to the magical realism that infuses Filipino culture. The stories shared by her characters are based on the same tales handed down to Holthe from her Filipino father and lola, her grandmother. This stunning debut novel is the first to celebrate in such richness and depth the spirit of the Filipino people and their fascinating story and marks the introduction of a talented new author who will join the ranks of writers such as Arundhati Roy, Manil Suri, and Amy Tan.From the Hardcover edition.

Rural Kentucky in the 1950s is not an easy place to grow up in, and it's especially hard for 10-year-old Icy Sparks, an orphan who lives with her grandparents. Life becomes even more difficult for Icy when the violent tics and uncontrollable cursing begin. Icy's adolescence is marred by the humiliation brought on by her mysterious condition, and its all-too-visible symptoms are the source of endless hilarity as everyone around her offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl. Eventually, Icy finds solace in the company of an obese woman who knows what it's like to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Narrated by a now-grown Icy, this first novel shimmers with warmth and humor as it recounts a young girl's painful and poignant journey to womanhood--and the many lives she touches and enriches along the way.

He plays a Manhattan adman plunged into a realm of spy (James Mason) and counterspy (Eva Marie Saint) and variously abducted, framed for murder, chased and, in a signature set-piece, crop-dusted. He also hangs for dear life from the facial features of Mount Rushmore's Presidents. Savor one of Hollywood's most enjoyable thrillers ever in this state-of-the-art restoration.

Even today, animals wield symbolic powers as varied as the cultures that embrace them. Sacred cows, wily serpents, fearsome lions, elegant swans, busy bees, and sly foxes--all are caricatures of the creatures themselves, yet they reflect not only how different cultures see the natural world around them but also how such cultures make use of their native animals. In this fun and thought-provoking book, historian and animal enthusiast Boria Sax argues for a classification of animals that goes beyond the biological to encompass a more meaningful distinction: tradition. From ants and elephants to tigers and tortoises, The Mythical Zoo weaves together a crosscultural tapestry encompassing mythology, history, art, science, philosophy, and literature. The result is a beautifully illustrated, masterfully composed love letter to the animal kingdom""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm—a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not—charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion.The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale. As Kingsolver says of Hillary Jordan, ""Her characters walked straight out of 1940s Mississippi and into the part of my brain where sympathy and anger and love reside, leaving my heart racing. They are with me still.""   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

At the centre is George Willard, a young reporter who becomes the confidant of the town's 'grotesques'--solitary figures unable to communicate with others. George is their conduit for expression and solace from loneliness, but he has his own longings which eventually draw him away from home to seek a career in the city. He carries with him the dreams and unuttered words of remarkable characters such as Wing Biddlebaum, the disgraced former teacher, and the story-telling Doctor Parcival.

Van Dorn puts his chief investigator on the case, and Isaac Bell soon realizes that the clues point not to suicide but to murder. And when more suspicious deaths follow, it becomes clear that someone-an elusive spy-is orchestrating the destruction of America's brightest technological minds... and the murders all connect to a top- secret project called Hull 44.But that is just the beginning. As the intrigue deepens, Bell will find himself pitted against German, Japanese, and British spies, in a mission that encompasses dreadnought battleships, Teddy Roosevelt's Great White Fleet, Chinatown, Hell's Kitchen, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Isaac Bell has certainly faced perilous situations before, but this time it is more than the future of his country that's at stake- it's the fate of the world.

When her lover casts her off, denying their union, she is forced to travel to London, a city that attracts and alarms her in equal measure. There she takes up a position in the house of an apothecary, Grayson Black, whom she trusts to salvage what remains of her reputation.From the highly-acclaimed author of The Great Stink comes a gloriously-written tale of consuming passions and obsessions. Set against the clamour and roar of eighteenth-century London, The Nature of Monsters brings vividly to life a world where the line separating science and madness is dangerously blurred, and where a single life counts for little in the relentless pursuit of progress.

Helen Ames--recently widowed, coping with loss and grief, unable to do the work that has always sustained her--is beginning to depend far too much on her twenty-seven-year-old daughter, Tessa, and is meddling in her life, offering unsolicited and unwelcome advice. Helen's problems are compounded by her shocking discovery that her mild-mannered and loyal husband was apparently leading a double life. The Ameses had painstakingly saved for a happy retirement, but that money disappeared in several large withdrawals made by Helen's husband before he died. In order to support herself and garner a measure of much needed independence, Helen takes an unusual job that ends up offering far more than she had anticipated. And then a phone call from a stranger sets Helen on a surprising path of discovery that causes both mother and daughter to reassess what they thought they knew about each other, themselves, and what really makes a home and a family.From the Hardcover edition.

The essays span a range of topics from iconic ancient travel stories to modern tourism. They discuss travel in the ancient world, modern heroic travels, the literary culture of missionary travel, the intersection of fiction and travel narratives, modern literary traditions and visions of Greece, personal identity, and expatriation. Essays also address travel memoirs, the re-imagining of worlds through travel, transformed landscapes and animals in travel narratives, diplomacy, English women travel writers, and pilgrimage and health in the medieval world. The history of travel writing takes in multiple pursuits: exploration and conquest, religious pilgrimage and missionary work, educational tourism and diplomacy, scientific and personal discovery, and natural history and oral history. As a literary genre, it has enhanced a wide range of disciplines, including geography, ethnography, anthropology, and linguistics. Moreover, twenty-first-century interests in travel and travel writing have produced a global framework that promises to expand travel's theoretical reach into the depths of the Internet, thus challenging our conventional concept of what it means to travel. The fact that travel and travel writing have a prehistory that is embedded in foundational religious texts and ancient narratives of journey, like the Odyssey and the Epic of Gilgamesh, makes both travel and travel writing fundamental and essential expressions of humanity. Travel encourages writing, particularly as epistolary and poetic chronicling. This is clearly a history and tradition that began with human communication and which has kept pace with our collective development.""--Provided by publisher.

Together, they explore Austen’s connections with Edmund Burke, Adam Smith, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Madame de Staël, Joanna Baillie, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck, and other writers engaged in debates on the sensuous experience and the intellectual judgment of art. Our contributors look at Austen’s engagement with diverse art forms, painting, ballet, drama, poetry, and music, investigating our topic within historically grounded and theoretically nuanced essays. They represent Austen as a writer-thinker reflecting on the nature and practice of artistic creation and considering the social, moral, psychological, and theological functions of art in her fiction. We suggest that Austen knew, modified, and transformed the dominant aesthetic discourses of her era, at times ironically, to her own artistic ends. As a result, a new, and compelling image of Austen emerges, a “portrait of a lady artist” confidently promoting her own distinctly post-enlightenment aesthetic system.

He argues that the Odyssey concerns precisely the relation between philosophy and poetry and, more broadly, the rational and the irrational in human beings. In light of this possibility, Bernardete works back and forth from Homer to Plato to examine the relation between wisdom and justice and tries to recover an original understanding of philosophy that Plato, too, recovered by reflecting on the wisdom of the poet. At stake in his argument is no less than the history of philosophy and the ancient understanding of poetry. The Bow and the Lyre is a book that every classicist and historian of philosophy should have.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. One critic called Wally Lamb a ""modern-day Dostoyevsky,"" whose characters struggle not only with their respective pasts, but with a ""mocking, sadistic God"" in whom they don't believe but to whom they turn, nevertheless, in times of trouble (New York Times).In his new novel, The Hour I First Believed, Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues.While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface.As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary — and American.The Hour I First Believed is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.

Now her life is a waiting game. Waiting for time to heal her wounds, waiting for justice. Waiting for a miracle to happen.For Shay Bourne, life holds no more surprises. The world has given him nothing, and he has nothing to offer the world. In a heartbeat, though, something happens one day that changes everything for him. Now he has one last chance for salvation, and it lies with June's twelve-year-old daughter, Claire. But between Shay and Claire stretches an ocean of bitter regrets, past crimes and the rage of a mother who has lost her child.Would you give up your vengeance against someone you hate, if it meant saving someone you love? Would you want your dreams to come true, if it meant granting your enemy's dying wish?Once again, Jodi Picoult mesmerises and enthralls readers with a story of justice, love and redemption.

Ditto 'survivors.'""So begins the unexpurgated first-person narrative of nineteen-year-old Skyler Rampike, the only surviving child of an ""infamous"" American family. A decade ago the Rampikes were destroyed by the murder of Skyler's six-year-old ice-skating champion sister, Bliss, and the media scrutiny that followed. Part investigation into the unsolved murder; part elegy for the lost Bliss and for Skyler's own lost childhood; and part corrosively funny expose of the pretensions of upper-middle-class American suburbia, this captivating novel explores with unexpected sympathy and subtlety the intimate lives of those who dwell in Tabloid Hell.Likely to be Joyce Carol Oates's most controversial novel to date, as well as her most boldly satirical, this unconventional work of fiction is sure to be recognized as a classic exploration of the tragic interface between private life and the perilous life of ""celebrity.""

Her timid younger brother has never left home. When her bullying black-sheep older brother moves into ""his"" house as well, it's war.Each heir wants the house. Yet to buy the other out, two siblings must team against one. Just as in girlhood, Corlis is torn between allying with the decent but fearful youngest and the iconoclastic eldest, who covets his legacy to destroy it. A Perfectly Good Family is a stunning examination of inheritance, literal and psychological: what we take from our parents, what we discard, and what we are stuck with, like it or not.

Young, toughened and tried in the hellish crucible of Burma, he labours, sometimes faltering, beneath the weight of tradition, the glorious heritage of his family, and the burden of his own self-doubt. For Blackwood, the horizon is not the lip of the trench seen by men of the Corps in the previous war, but the ramp of a landing craft smashing down into the sea, and the fire of the enemy on a Sicilian beach. Here, tradition is not enough, and Mike Blackwood must find within himself qualities of leadership which will inspire those Royal Marines who are once again the first to land, and among the first to die. This is the fourth novel in the Blackwood saga, spanning 150 years in the history of a great seafaring family and the tradition in which they served.

Partial Magic: The Novel as a Self-Conscious Genre,Robert Alter,literature,First published in 1975,/works/OL3932271W?edition=ia%3Apartialmagicnove0000alte,/authors/OL716609A/Robert_Alter,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21488595M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1975|Publisher  Universioty of California Press|Language English,"This new work by an imaginative critic of vigorous intellectual powers radically revises our understanding of the novel as a genre. Against a variety of critical stances, from Marxist and Freudian to Jamesian and Leavisite, Mr. Alter argues that ""realism"" is by no means the exclusive generic aim of the novel. He maintains that the novel, beginning from Cervantes with the erosion of belief in the authority of the written word, has been much more essentially playful and inquisitively philosophical than prevailing critical notions allow. Mr. Alter explores the writer's pleasure in the extravagant manipulation of narrative artifice in a line of major self-conscious novelists from the late seventeenth century to the present - Cervantes, Sterne, Diderot, Thackeray, Melville, Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Gide and Nabokov. His readings of particular masterworks of fiction are combined with a large historical overview which brings us finally to a consideration of the confusions and emerging possibilities of the contemporary period. Written in a lucid, lively, non-technical style, this book significantly expands our understanding of the novel and the ways in which it delights us and engages us most deeply.

Justin Fisher has a successful career as the manager of a luxury hotel, a lovely wife, and a charming young son. While all signs point to a bright future, Justin can no longer ignore the hole in his life left by his estranged family. When he finally gathers the courage to reconnect with his troubled past, Justin is devastated to learn that his parents have passed away. And a visit to the cemetery brings the greatest shock of all--next to the graves of his father and mother sits a smaller tombstone for a three-year-old boy: a boy named Thomas Justin Fisher.What follows is an extraordinary journey as Justin struggles with issues of his own identity and pieces together the complex and heartbreaking truth about his family. With great skill and care, Dianne Dixon explores the toll that misunderstandings, blame, and resentment can take on a family. But it is the intimate details of family life--a mother's lullaby for her son, a father's tragic error in judgment--that make this novel so exceptional and an absolute must for reading groups everywhere.The Language of Secrets is the story of an unspeakable loss born of human frailty and an ultimate redemption born of human courage.From the Hardcover edition.

I am therefore I think. So starts John Banville's 1973 novel Birchwood, a novel that centers around Gabriel Godkin and his return to his dilapidated family estate. After years away, Gabriel returns to a house filled with memories and despair. Delving deep into family secrets--a cold father, a tortured mother, an insane grandmother--Gabriel also recalls his first encounters with love and loss. At once a novel of a family, of isolation,  and of a blighted Ireland, Birchwood is a remarkable and complex story about the end of innocence for one boy and his country, told in the brilliantly styled prose of one of our most essential writers.From the Trade Paperback edition.

In the years after, their father, John, taught them about the paranormal evil that lives in the dark corners and on the back roads of America...and he taught them how to kill it.Sam and Dean have hit New York City to check out a local rocker's haunted house. But before they can figure out why a lovesick banshee in an '80s heavy-metal T-shirt is wailing in the bedroom, a far more macabre crime catches their attention. Not far from the house, two university students were beaten to death by a strange assailant. A murder that's bizarre even by New York City standards, it's the latest in a line of killings that the brothers soon suspect are based on the creepy stories of legendary writer Edgar Allan Poe.Their investigation leads them to the center of one of Poe's horror classics, face-to-face with their most terrifying foe yet. And if Sam and Dean don't rewrite the ending of this chilling tale, a grisly serial killer will end their lives forevermore.   Read more Read less",38 Want to read|1 Currently reading|4 Have read

Undergoing psychoanalytic therapy is always a leap into the dark—like dedicating our hearts and intellect to a powerful work of literature, it's impossible to know beforehand its ultimate effect and consequences. One must remain open to where the ""side effects"" will lead.Erudite, eloquent, and enthrallingly observant, Adam Phillips is one of the world's most respected psychoanalysts and a boldly original writer and thinker—and the ideal guide to exploring the provocative connections between psychoanalytic treatment and enduring, transformative literature. His fascinating and thoughtful Side Effects offers a valuable intellectual blueprint for the construction of a life beholden to no ideology other than the fulfillment of personal promise.

Buckley Jr. weaves into this gripping yet surprisingly empathetic political novel.The Rake brings together Buckley's keen political insight and his tale-spinning craft to tell the story of a candidate on the rise and the dark shadows cast behind him. As Reuben Castle, the prototypical child of the sixties, coasts through his early life on a cloud of easy charisma, he leaves behind more skeletons than Arlington: a highly questionable Vietnam record, an abandoned wife, and worse. Yet two decades later, just as his dreams are within reach, he learns that his personal history is about to become his political epitaph—unless he takes the direst of measures to protect himself. With a blend of satire and suspense, Buckley offers an archly pointed portrait of a familiar icon. A novel by the defining conservative of our times, about a figure bearing an unmistakable resemblance to the defining liberal of our times, The Rake is a welcome new masterpiece, and Buckley's most winning, and provocative, novel in years.

On his odyssey through Ireland and Britain, and across the Atlantic to “the Boston states,” Fergus is initiated to violence, sexual heat, and the glories and dangers of the industrial revolution. Along the way, he meets an unforgettable generation of boy soldiers, brigands, street toughs and charming, willful girls – all struggling for survival in the aftermath of natural catastrophe magnified by political callousness and brutal neglect.  Peter Behrens transports the reader to another time and place for a deeply-moving and resonant experience. The Law of Dreams is gorgeously written in incandescent language that unleashes the sexual and psychological energies of a lost world while plunging the reader directly into a vein of history that haunts the ancestral memory of millions in a new millennium.

Me, I can't feel low around birds. it wipes your mind clean just watching them.'Birders are addicts. Rarely-seen birds are the best drug they know. Whether they're cleaning toilets, sitting in a caff, doodling or dancing, when the pager bleeps with news that up on Stornoway or out on the Kent salt-flats or on a Scilly rock there's a supertick sighting, Bish, Stevie Red Bus and the gang pile into their car and belt up the motorway just for the pure thrill, the shared exaltation of seeing that rare bird in all its feathered reality.It's some way to live a life, at least. Half the time it matters so much you'll kill to protect it and half the time you wonder why you bother carrying on at all. And somewhere in between you might just find something that looks like mating for life: find it, lose it, then find it all over again.Pelican Blood is a rare sighting itself: an irreverent, funny, moving novel that soars and swoops as gracefully as the birds it so adores.

"Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi",Geoff Dyer,literature,First published in 2009,/works/OL1989156W?edition=ia%3Ajeffinvenicedeat0000dyer_n4u6,/authors/OL239440A/Geoff_Dyer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL20988837M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Pantheon Books|Language English,"A wildly original novel of erotic fulfillment and spiritual yearning. Every two years the international art world descends on Venice for the opening of the Biennale. Among them is Jeff Atman--a jaded and dissolute journalist--whose dedication to the cause of Bellini-fuelled partygoing is only intermittently disturbed by the obligation to file a story. When he meets the spellbinding Laura, he is rejuvenated, ecstatic. Their romance blossoms quickly, but is it destined to disappear just as rapidly? Every day thousands of pilgrims head to the banks of the Ganges at Varanasi, the holiest Hindu city in India. Among their number is a narrator who may or may not be the Atman previously seen in Venice. Intending to visit only for a few days he ends up staying for months, and suddenly finds--or should that be loses?--a hitherto unexamined idea of himself, the self. In a romance he can only observe, he sees a reflection of the kind of pleasures that, willingly or not, he has renounced.  In the process, two ancient and watery cities become versions of each other. Could two stories, in two different cities, actually be one and the same story? Nothing Geoff Dyer has written before is as wonderfully unbridled, as dead-on in evocation of place, longing and the possibility of neurotic enlightenment, and as irrepressibly entertaining as Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.From the Hardcover edition.

On the eve of her ninth birthday, unassuming Rose Edelstein, a girl at the periphery of schoolyard games and her distracted parents' attention, bites into her mother's homemade lemon-chocolate cake and discovers she has a magical gift: she can taste her mother's emotions in the cake. She discovers this gift to her horror, for her mother--her cheerful, good-with-crafts, can-do mother--tastes of despair and desperation. Suddenly, and for the rest of her life, food becomes a peril and a threat to Rose. The curse her gift has bestowed is the secret knowledge all families keep hidden--her mother's life outside the home, her father's detachment, her brother's clash with the world. Yet as Rose grows up she learns to harness her gift and becomes aware that there are secrets even her taste buds cannot discern.  The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake is a luminous tale about the enormous difficulty of loving someone fully when you know too much about them. It is heartbreaking and funny, wise and sad, and confirms Aimee Bender's place as ""a writer who makes you grateful for the very existence of language"" (San Francisco Chronicle).

Lenhart directly confronts and deeply analyzes these questions while offering readers his clear, informative discussion. -Lorenzo ThomasThe Stamp of Class explores the nature of reading poetry in the context of class and its themes and sheds new light on how this important yet little-heralded subject affects the poet's life and work. While numerous works have taken up the question of race and gender as they relate to literary creation, this is the first book of its kind to probe the interplay between class and American poetry. Author Gary Lenhart considers poetry and class across a wide variety of time periods and poetic trends and reflects on a range of influential poets from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries.The essays in The Stamp of Class deal with the question of class as reflected in the works of Tracie Morris, Tillie Olsen, Melvin Tolson, William Carlos Williams, Walt Whitman, and others. The work is rooted in the author's own experiences as a working-class poet and teacher and is the result of more than a decade of exploration. Poet and scholar Gary Lenhart is Lecturer in English at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. His most recent books of poetry are Father and Son Night, Light Heart, and One at a Time. His essays and reviews have appeared in numerous magazines and journals, including the American Poetry Review, American Book Review, and Exquisite Corpse.

Analyzing a range of sources, including sexology texts, early cinema, and African American literature, Siobhan B. Somerville argues that the emerging understanding of homosexuality depended on the context of the black/white “color line,” the dominant system of racial distinction during this period. This book thus critiques and revises tendencies to treat race and sexuality as unrelated categories of analysis, showing instead that race has historically been central to the cultural production of homosexuality.  At about the same time that the 1896 Supreme Court Plessy v. Ferguson decision hardened the racialized boundary between black and white, prominent trials were drawing the public’s attention to emerging categories of sexual identity. Somerville argues that these concurrent developments were not merely parallel but in fact inextricably interrelated and that the discourses of racial and sexual “deviance” were used to reinforce each other’s terms. She provides original readings of such texts as Havelock Ellis’s late nineteenth-century work on “sexual inversion,” the 1914 film A Florida Enchantment, the novels of Pauline E. Hopkins, James Weldon Johnson’s Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man, and Jean Toomer’s fiction and autobiographical writings, including Cane. Through her analyses of these texts and her archival research, Somerville contributes to the growing body of scholarship that focuses on discovering the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality.  Queering the Color Line will have broad appeal across disciplines including African American studies, gay and lesbian studies, literary criticism, cultural studies, cinema studies, and gender studies.

Putnam's Sons|Language English,"A series of unexplained deaths in foreign hospitals sends an idealistic UCLA medical student on a desperate search for answers, in this chilling tale from the master of the medical thriller.  Jennifer Hernandez is a fourth-year medical student at UCLA, just completing an elective in general surgery, whose world is shattered during a break in an otherwise ordinary day. While relaxing in the surgical lounge of L. A. ’s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, she half-listens to a piece on medical tourism, where first-world citizens travel to third-world countries for surgery. But when she hears her beloved grandmother’s name mentioned, her own heart nearly stops: the CNN reporter says Maria Suarez-Hernandez had died, a day after undergoing a hip replacement in New Delhi’s Queen Victoria Hospital. Maria had raised Jennifer and her brothers from infancy, and their bond was unshakable. Still, the news that Maria had traveled to India was a shock to Jennifer, until she realized that it was the only viable option for the hardworking yet uninsured woman.  Devastated, and desperate for answers, Jennifer takes emergency leave from school and heads to India, where relations with local officials go from sympathetic to sour as she presses for more information. With the discovery of other unexplained deaths followed by hasty cremations, Jennifer reaches out to her mentor, New York City medical examiner Dr. Laurie Montgomery, who has her own deep connection to Maria.  Laurie, along with her husband, Dr. Jack Stapleton, rushes to the younger woman’s side, discovering a sophisticated medical facility with little margin for error. As the death count grows, so do the questions, leading Laurie and Jennifer to unveil a sinister, multilayered conspiracy of global proportions.

What is the role of the book in an age preoccupied with computers and the internet? How has the book publishing industry been transformed by the economic and technological upheavals of recent years, and how is it likely to change in the future?  This is the first major study of the book publishing industry in Britain and the United States for more than two decades. Thompson focuses on academic and higher education publishing and analyses the evolution of these sectors from 1980 to the present. He shows that each sector is characterized by its own distinctive `logic' or dynamic of change, and that by reconstructing this logic we can understand the problems, challenges and opportunities faced by publishing firms today. He also shows that the digital revolution has had, and continues to have, a profound impact on the book publishing business, although the real impact of this revolution has little to do with the ebook scenarios imagined by many commentators.  Books in the Digital Age will become a standard work on the publishing industry at the beginning of the 21st century. It will be of great interest to students taking courses in the sociology of culture, media and cultural studies, and publishing. It will also be of great value to professionals in the publishing industry, educators and policy makers, and to anyone interested in books and their future. - Publisher.

The daughter of Hollywood royalty, Paige channels her own acting dreams into making her daughter, Emma, a star. By the age of nine, Emma is playing a central role in a hit TV show. Then everything is shattered by unforeseeable tragedy. Now Emma is living with her aunt Whitney, who had chosen a very different path than her sister. Whitney was always the studious older sister, hating the cult of celebrity that enveloped their childhood. Instead, she is a psychiatrist who lives for her work and enjoys a no-strings-attached love affair with a wealthy venture capitalist. But at a moment's notice, Whitney drops everything to help her niece. Once famous, outgoing, and charismatic, Emma is a shadow of her former self--without speech, without memory, lost and terrified. But with her aunt Whitney's help, along with a team of caregivers and doctors, Emma begins to find her way, starting her young life all over again--and changing the lives of everyone around her""-   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Billy-Ray Belcourt’s debut memoir opens with a tender letter to his kokum and memories of his early life in the hamlet of Joussard, Alberta, and on the Driftpile First Nation. Piece by piece, Billy-Ray’s writings invite us to unpack and explore the big and broken world he inhabits every day, in all its complexity and contradiction: a legacy of colonial violence and the joy that flourishes in spite of it; first loves and first loves lost; sexual exploration and intimacy; the act of writing as a survival instinct and a way to grieve.  What emerges is not only a profound meditation on memory, gender, anger, shame, and ecstasy, but also the outline of a way forward. With startling honesty, and in a voice distinctly and assuredly his own, Belcourt situates his life experiences within a constellation of seminal queer texts, among which this book is sure to earn its place. Eye-opening, intensely emotional, and excessively quotable, A History of My Brief Body demonstrates over and over again the power of words to both devastate and console us.

Zoe, una chica explosiva y temperamental, doble campeona olímpica, es el rostro publicitario de una conocida marca de agua mineral. Vive en un lujoso piso en Manchester y tiene muchos amantes ocasionales.  Kate es más sensata y tranquila. Está casada con Jack, un campeón de ciclismo, y está volcada en su hija Sophie que padece leucemia. Por esa razón Kate no ha podido competir en los dos últimos juegos olímpicos, y Londres 2012 es su última oportunidad.  Cuando Tom, su común entrenador, recibe la noticia de la Federación Inglesa de Ciclismo de que solo podrá enviar a una participante. Elegir entre Kate o Zoe es una decisión particularmente difícil, porque Tom conoce la historia de ambas. Pero tiene que ser imparcial y organiza una carrera entre ellas para nombrar la vencedora. Sin embargo, justo el día de la competición, el estado de salud de Sophie empeora gravemente…   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What, in fact, does it tell us, and how are its messages conveyed? What is it we find so satisfying in the format of television police series, or in quiz or sports programmes, that we enjoy watching them again and again? Reading Television was the book that first pushed the boundaries of television studies beyond the insights offered by cultural studies and textual analysis, creating a vibrant new field of study. Using the tools and techniques in this book, it is possible for everyone who has access to a television set to produce illuminating analyzes not only of the programmes themselves, but also of the culture which produces them.In this edition, Hartley reflects on the development of television studies since the publication of this enormously influential book, and updated suggestions.  His new foreword both underlines and ensures the continuing relevance of this foundational text, which provides the ideal entry into an area of study crucial for anyone interested in contemporary culture.

Michael is a lonely, rather pathetic writer, obsessed by the film, 'What A Carve Up!' in which a mad kinfeman cuts his way through the inhabitants of a decrepit stately pile as the thunder rages. Inexplicably he is commissioned to write the family history of the Winshaws, an upper class Yorkshire clan whose members have a finger in every establishment pie, from arms dealing to art dealing, from politics to banking to the popular press and factory farming. During his researches Michael realizes that the Winshaws have cast a blight on his life, as they have on Britain. His confidence, his sexual and personal identity begin to reform. In a climax set in the Winshaw's family seat the novel turns into the film, 'What A Carve Up!' as a murderous maniac stalks the family and Michael discovers the significance of Shirley Eaton's lingere.

Now Tehmina is being asked to choose between her old, familiar life in India and a new one in Ohio with her son, his American wife, and their child. She must decide whether to leave the comforting landscape of her native India for the strange rituals of life in a new country.This is a journey Tehmina, a middle-aged Parsi woman, must travel alone.The Parsis were let into India almost a millennium ago because of their promise to ""sweeten"" and enrich the lives of the people in their adopted country. This is an ancient promise that Tehmina takes seriously. And so, while faced with the larger choice of whether to stay in America or not, Tehmina is also confronted with another, more urgent choice: whether to live in America as a stranger or as a citizen. Citizenship implies connection, participation, and involvement. Soon destiny beckons in the form of two young, troubled children next door. It is the plight of these two boys that forces Tehmina to choose. She will either straddle two worlds forever and live in a no-man's land or jump into the fullness of her new life in America.If Today Be Sweet is a novel that celebrates family and community. It is an honest but affectionate look at contemporary America—the sterility of its suburban life, the tinsel of its celebrity culture, but also the generosity of its people and their thirst for connection and communication. Eloquently written, evocative, and unforgettable, If Today Be Sweet is a poignant look at issues of immigration, identity, family life, and hope. It is a novel that shows how cultures can collide and become better for it.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This mysteriously coded script detailed crucial future events involving both Israel and the United States and their relation to the return of Jesus Christ. During a trip to England to visit an old friend, Dr. Ezra Schroeder, a National Security Administration code breaker, happens upon the cryptic contents of Newton's final work. With each passing day, as the political clouds around the United States and Israel grow increasingly ominous, Ezra knows what he must do. With this vital knowledge in hand, he must become a modern day Moses and implore the reluctant president of the United States to come to the aid of the Jewish state of Israel which is on the brink on total annihilation.

The Angel World And Other Poems,Philip James Bailey,literature,First published in 1850,/works/OL7419444W?edition=ia%3Aangelworldotherp00bail,/authors/OL2239743A/Philip_James_Bailey,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7024893M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1850|Publisher  Ticknor, Reed, and Fields","The Angel World And Other Poems is a collection of 17 poems written by Philip James Bailey: The Angle World (77 pages), The Return (3 pages), Hymn of Thanks (2 pages), Autumn (3 pages), The Ring (3 pages), To The Trent (3 pages), An Ancient Legend (5 page), London (1 page), A Ruin (1 page), A Fragment (2 pages), Lovers (1 page), A Myth (1 page), Morning (4 pages),  A Mystery (1 page), Prayer (2 pages), Hymn (2 pages), and Knowledge (3 pages); many of these poems have a religious theme, relating to Heaven, the Angels, and God.  The Angel World is a poem that describes an Angel’s battle against a demon. The poem starts off describing the Angel’s world (Heaven) as a beautiful place. The Angels themselves are also beautiful and they are sinless and divine. Eventually this beautiful realm fell under the control of Tempters and Demons and became miserable and desolate. However, in the end, the Angel was able to successfully defeat the Demon and restore his beloved ones and his world to their former, pure and beautiful selves.  The Return is a poem about the return of people from all nations to God when they die. The poem describes the many different parts of the world where people live: the place where trees thrive, the place where people mine silver and gold, the place where gems are found, the place where coral grows ect… Even with all of these different backgrounds, everyone on earth is related through God. When people on this earth die, they will all reunite with one another in heaven.  The Hymn of Thanks is a poem that gives praise and thanks to God, in particular Jesus Christ, for sacrificing pain in order to save us; Jesus went through a lot of pain and temptation while he was man on Earth. Because of this, Jesus understands the pain that humans suffer, allowing people to turn to him when we need help.  Autumn describes the change in nature from the summer season to the fall season. Summer, in terms of nature, is analogous to a strong warrior; summer is nature’s “prime” moment just like being a “strong warrior” is the “prime time” in a man’s life. Autumn is when nature starts to “die.” Chilling rains fall, clouds form, and woods and leaves start to fall. This poem compares autumn to a warrior getting sick, tired and dying.  The Ring is a Ballard that talks about the marriage of a Venetian maid and a man. The man tells the maid that he truly loves her and he will risk his body and soul for her; he then asks her what she wants for his hand in marriage. The maid replies that a bridal ring is good enough and that they should wed at sea. While both of them were at sea with the Doge, the Venetian “duke,” the bride accidentally drops her bridal ring off the boat. The man jumps into the sea and retrieves the ring successfully but dies in the process. The maid weeps for her husband, claiming that she can not love another man. The maid eventually dies and they buried the bridal ring with her body.  To the Trent is an ode to a river in central England. The speaker in the poem declares his love for the Trent; the best moments of his life were spent at the Trent, relaxing at its bank and admiring the reflection of the sun on its waters. An interesting thing that the speaker states is that he loves the Trent even more when heavy rains come and the Trent floods, invading and destroying villages and towns. He states flooding is when she exerts her will over men and animal, like God, her creator, in heaven.  An Ancient Legend is a poem that retells the story behind a rock in a small town. The rock was originally the “crown” of a church. One day when the town gathered at the church to worship, a demon appeared and attacked the church. He ripped the stone from its resting place and killed the minister with it. Saint Wilfred then stood up and confronted the demon. He states that God and the Saints will always protect the church and the faithful. The demon then left the church in rage and the stone is lying where the demon left it.  London is an ode to the city London. The speaker praises London for its rich history and beautiful architecture, and states that London is the most beautiful city in the world; it is the best art that man can make. The speaker also tells God to look at London and its hundreds of shrines and churches. The speaker acknowledges that hundreds of shrines are too few for God but that does not prevent London, and the world, from praising God.  A Ruin is a poem that describes a deserted abbey. It states that it is strange for a house that is vowed to God to be hurled down and in shambles. The poem then compares this abbey to man, both are mortal and non-everlasting; this can be broaden up to the statement that nothing on Earth is everlasting, only God is.  A Fragment starts of with a person describing how he sees temples going to the heavens, which represents how good and virtuous people go to heaven and are rewarded by God when they die. In contrast, the poem later on describes how evildoers are punished by God when they die. In conclusion, all of us have the free will to choose between good and evil and the choices we make will decide where we will go after we die.  The poem Lovers refers to the relationship between a rose and a nightingale; the rose cries for the nightingale so the nightingale comes and “dries her tears.” The poem then says how the rose will always be happy with the nightingale, even when the world grows weary. This can mean be interpreted as true love can lead to eternal happiness.  A Myth introduces with the sun god Apollo leaving his lyre on a stone, thus granting the stone (earth) and mankind the great gift of his divine music. Once man is touched by the divine, his questions will be answered, he will be in harmony, and he will be able to relax.  Morning is a poem with four parts. The first part describes the sun as a sun goddess on rosy chariot that flies over the sleeping earth. Part 2 describes the goddess’ great splendor and power, spreading light to the earth. Part 2 also compares the sun to an eagle that flies proudly around the earth as the “king of birds.” Part 3 praises the sun goddess for bringing light and life to the earth. Part 4 mourns over the goddess since she will not be there forever; she flies around the earth, making some parts of it morning and other parts of it night.  In A Mystery a person is talking to his friend, saying that it has been a long time since they last met. The person then talks about how they may not meet anymore until they die and go to heaven. The Mystery to this person is that during life, everyone is bounded and united by destiny and fate. At death, everyone is separated but death is also an act of fate. Many will try to contemplate fate and destiny but almost none will understand.  Prayer is a poem telling all men to worship and praise God the Creator. God created the universe so he is powerful and almighty. However even with this lofty stature, every human being is connected to him (God) and this connection is very important. The poem then talks about the end of the universe when “elements … fail, and burning systems stiffen or depart into their graves of darkness and decay.” At this time, man will be restored to his true nature and he will be with God forever.  Hymn is a poem that describes and praises Jesus Christ, savior of the world. Jesus is the Lord of armies, Prince of Peace, the sun of righteousness, the star of wisdom, and the owner of all things: kings, priests, emperors, masters ect… However even with this lofty stature, Jesus came down, became a lowly man and sacrificed himself for our sins. Because of this, he is greatly rewarded and exalted.  Knowledge is a poem describing the knowledge and wisdom of God. God knows when the world will end and drift off into empty space; God makes, destroys and saves. In order to understand this, people will have to read the “runes of old,” which is an extremely hard and strenuous process. However, people do not need to know this. All that we need to know is that we will die one day. When we die, we will rejoice with our all-knowing God in heaven.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

So begins Fiona and Patricia's friendship that warm autumn morning in first grade in Lake Charles, Louisiana, their bond forged ever closer by Fiona's abusive mother and Patricia's neglectful one. Their relationship is a source of continuity and strength through their move to L.A. to become actresses; through Fiona's marriage and Patricia's sudden fame. When husband and career pressures exact a toll, the women wonder if their friendship can survive. Then a dark secret from their past emerges, threatening to destroy not only their bond, but all they've worked for as well.The Safety of Secrets is a beautifully written exploration of the bonds forged in childhood and challenged decades later, of the fulfillment of dreams and the damage they can cause, and of secrets being uncovered and the truth we find inside.

Supporting the suspicion that the story collection is more Parisian than Persian, some of its most famous tales, including the stories of Aladdin and Ali Baba, appear nowhere in the original sources. Yet as befits a world where magic lamps may conceal a jinni and fabulous treasures lie just beyond secret doors, the truth of the Nights is richer than standard criticism suggests. Marvellous Thieves recovers the cross-cultural encounters--the collaborations, borrowings, and acts of literary larceny--that produced the 1001 Nights in European languages. Ranging from the coffeehouses of Aleppo to the salons of Paris, from colonial Calcutta to Bohemian London, Paulo Lemos Horta introduces readers to the poets and scholars, pilgrims and charlatans who made crucial but largely unacknowledged contributions to this most famous of story collections. Each version of the Nights betrays the distinctive cultural milieu in which it was produced and the workshop atmosphere of its compilation. Time and again, Horta shows, stories were retold and elaborate commentaries added to remake the Nights in accordance with the personalities and ambitions of the storytellers and writers. Untangling the intricate web of invention and plagiarism that ensnares the Nights, Horta rehabilitates the voices hidden in its long history--voices that mirror the endless potential of Shahrazad's stories to proliferate.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Epic and the Russian Novel from Gogol to Pasternak,Frederick T.

By removing the Russian novel from its European context, the authors reveal that it developed as a means of reconnecting the narrative form with its origins in classical and Christian epic in a way that expressed the Russian desire to renew and restore ancient spirituality. Through this methodology, Griffiths and Rabinowitz dispute Bakhtin’s classification of epic as a monophonic and dead genre whose time has passed. Due to its grand themes and cultural centrality, the epic is the form most suited to newcomers or cultural outsiders seeking legitimacy through appropriation of the past. Through readings of Gogol’s Dead Souls—a uniquely problematic work, and one which Bakhtin argued was novelistic rather than epic—Dostoevsky’s Brothers Karamazov, Pasternak’s Dr. Zhivago, and Tolstoy’s War and Peace, this book redefines “epic”.

She returns to her bleak home, grief-stricken and unmoored. With her teenage daughters rebelling, her testy mother-in-law scrutinizing her every move, and her marriage grown cold, Lydia is restless and yearning for something more.  All of that changes with the arrival of her son’s tutor, Branwell Brontë, brother of her daughters’ governess, Miss Anne Brontë and those other writerly sisters, Charlotte and Emily. Branwell has his own demons to contend with—including living up to the ideals of his intelligent family—but his presence is a breath of fresh air for Lydia. Handsome, passionate, and uninhibited by social conventions, he’s also twenty-five to her forty-three. A love of poetry, music, and theatre bring mistress and tutor together, and Branwell’s colorful tales of his sisters’ elaborate play-acting and made-up worlds form the backdrop for seduction.  But Lydia’s new taste of passion comes with consequences. As Branwell’s inner turmoil rises to the surface, his behavior grows erratic and dangerous, and whispers of their passionate relationship spout from her servants’ lips, reaching all three protective Brontë sisters. Soon, it falls on Lydia to save not just her reputation, but her way of life, before those clever girls reveal all her secrets in their novels. Unfortunately, she might be too late.  Meticulously researched and deliciously told, Brontë’s Mistress is a captivating reimagining of the scandalous affair that has divided Brontë enthusiasts for generations and an illuminating portrait of a courageous, sharp-witted woman who fights to emerge with her dignity intact.

Dietrich von Hildebrand exposes the ""progressive"" Catholic agenda, its modus operandi and the dangerous heresies it promotes, contrary to traditional Catholic truth including the two main factors contributing to the deterioration of the Church, why true renewal in the church requires reaffirmation (not denigration) of tradition, why translating scripture into ""everyday"" language undermines faith and trivializes Christ's message, the war against beauty in Catholic art, architecture, and worship, the fundamental error in the ""new theologies"", the stark contrast between what Vatican II actually said and how it's been interpreted, why heresy must be condemned (and even punished), how relativism supplanted belief in objective truth, tricks progressive theologians play with language, three types of contemporary Catholic philosophers and where they go wrong, and much, much more.

The Literariness of Media Art,Claudia Benthien,literature,First published in 2018,/works/OL20930006W,/authors/OL8011576A/Claudia_Benthien,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English|Pages 330,"?Language can be this incredibly forceful material?there?s something about it where if you can    strip away its history, get to the materiality of it, it can rip into you like claws? (Hill in Vischer    1995, 11). This arresting image by media artist Gary Hill evokes the nearly physical force of    language to hold recipients in its grip. That power seems to lie in the material of language itself,    which, with a certain rawness, may captivate or touch, pounce on, or even harm its addressee.    Hill?s choice of words is revealing: ?rip into? suggests not only a metaphorical emotional pull but    also the literal physicality of linguistic attack. It is no coincidence that the statement comes from    a media artist, since media artworks often use language to produce a strong sensorial stimulus.    Media artworks not only manipulate language as a material in itself, but they also manipulate the    viewer?s perceptual channels. The guises and effects of language as artistic material are the topic    of this book, The Literariness of Media Art.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

There are few narrative accounts of Irish radicalism, and even fewer that engage 'history from below'. This book provides original insights in these relatively untilled fields. Exploring workers' experiences in various literary forms, from early to late capitalism, the twenty-two chapters make this book an authoritative and substantial contribution to Irish studies and English literary studies generally""--  ""Michael Pierse is Lecturer in Irish literature at Queen's University Belfast. His research mainly explores the writing and cultural production of Irish working-class life. Over recent years this work has expanded into new multidisciplinary themes and international contexts, including the study of festivals, digital methodologies in public humanities and theatre-as-research practices. Michael has contributed to a range of national and international publications, is the author of Writing Ireland's Working Class: Dublin after O'Casey (2011), and has been awarded several Arts and Humanities Research Council awards and the Vice Chancellor's Award at Queen's""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Scott Fitzgerald's reputation standing higher today than ever before, either during his lifetime or since his death, this book comes at an opportune time. For both long-standing admirers and readers still discovering his writings, it provides an ideal one-volume treasury of Fitzgerald's finest work--as a novelist, a writer of some of the most luminous short stories in the language, and an essayist of sharp perception and frank purpose.  Arthur Mizener, critic, reviewer, and author of The Far Side of Paradise, the first bull biography of Fitzgerald, has edited and made the selections for this Reader. In an acute and comprehensive introduction, he correlates Fitzgerald's work terms of the writer's thematic and technical progress. He has organized the selections into four distinct periods of Fitzgerald's career. The first is represented by six short stories--and by what many critics regard as his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, presented here in its entirety. The second includes four stories and the haunting opening passages of Tender Is the Night. The third period shows Fitzgerald coming out of the most serious crisis of his career with three remarkable essays. Five late short stories and two passages from his unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon complete the selections.    --jacket   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Set within a contemporary black community in Southern California, Brit Bennett's mesmerizing first novel is an emotionally perceptive story about community, love, and ambition. It begins with a secret. ""All good secrets have a taste before you tell them, and if we'd taken a moment to swish this one around our mouths, we might have noticed the sourness of an unripe secret, plucked too soon, stolen and passed around before its season."" It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken, seventeen-year-old beauty. Mourning her own mother's recent suicide, she takes up with the local pastor's son. Luke Sheppard is twenty-one, a former football star whose injury has reduced him to waiting tables at a diner. They are young; it's not serious. But the pregnancy that results from this teen romance--and the subsequent cover-up--will have an impact that goes far beyond their youth. As Nadia hides her secret from everyone, including Aubrey, her God-fearing best friend, the years move quickly. Soon, Nadia, Luke, and Aubrey are full-fledged adults and still living in debt to the choices they made that one seaside summer, caught in a love triangle they must carefully maneuver, and dogged by the constant, nagging question: What if they had chosen differently? The possibilities of the road not taken are a relentless haunt. In entrancing, lyrical prose, The Mothers asks whether a ""what if"" can be more powerful than an experience itself. If, as time passes, we must always live in servitude to the decisions of our younger selves, to the communities that have parented us, and to the decisions we make that shape our lives forever""--  It is the last season of high school life for Nadia Turner, a rebellious, grief-stricken beauty.

Postcolonialism Cross-Examined,Monika Albrecht,literature,First published in 2019,/works/OL20927658W,/authors/OL925389A/Monika_Albrecht,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English|Pages 308,"Taking a strikingly interdisciplinary and global approach, Postcolonialism Cross-Examined reflects on the current status of postcolonial studies and attempts to break through traditional boundaries, creating a truly comparative and genuinely global phenomenon. Drawing together the field of mainstream postcolonial studies with post-Soviet postcolonial studies and studies of the late Ottoman Empire, the contributors in this volume question many of the concepts and assumptions we have become accustomed to in postcolonial studies, creating a fresh new version of the field. The volume calls the merits of the field into question, investigating how postcolonial studies may have perpetuated and normalized colonialism as an issue exclusive to Western colonial and imperial powers. The volume is the first to open a dialogue between three different areas of postcolonial scholarship that previously developed independently from one another:  ? the wide field of postcolonial studies working on European colonialism,  ? the growing field of post-Soviet postcolonial/post-imperial studies,  ? the still fledgling field of post-Ottoman postcolonial/post-imperial studies, supported by sideways glances at the multidirectional conditions of interaction in East Africa and the East and West Indies.  Postcolonialism Cross-Examined looks at topics such as humanism, nationalism, multiculturalism, nostalgia, and the Anthropocene in order to piece together a new, broader vision for postcolonial studies in the twenty-first century. By including territories other than those covered by the postcolonial mainstream, the book strives to reframe the ?postcolonial? as a genuinely global phenomenon and develop multidirectional postcolonial perspectives.

Long troubled by the misguided images of skinny cowgirls on prancing palominos, the editors embarked on a mission to set the record straight. They wanted these western women to reveal the realities of their lives in their own words.  In Crazy Woman Creek, 153 women west of the Mississippi write of the ways they shape and sustain their communities. Whether these groups are organized, imposed, or spontaneous, this collection shows that where women gather, anything is possible. Readers will encounter Buddhists in Nebraska, Hutterites in South Dakota, rodeo moms rather than soccer moms. A woman chooses horse work over housework; neighbors pull together to fight a raging wildfire; a woman rides a donkey across Colorado to raise money after the tragedy at Columbine. Women recall harmony found at a drugstore, at a powwow, in a sewing circle. Lively, heartfelt, urgent, enduring, Crazy Woman Creek celebrates community — connections built or strengthened by women that unveil a new West.

Claudia's mother says she met her husband when she stopped him from jumping off a bridge. Her father says it happened when he saved her from an attempted robbery. Both parents are deaf but couldn't be more different; they can't even agree on how they met, much less who needed saving. Into this unlikely yet somehow inevitable union, our narrator is born. She comes of age with her brother in this strange, and increasingly estranged, household split between a small village in southern Italy and New York City. Without even sign language in common - their parents have not bothered to teach them - family communications are chaotic and rife with misinterpretations, by turns hilarious and devastating. An outsider in every way, she longs for a freedom she's not even sure exists. Only books and punk rock--and a tumultuous relationship--begin to show her the way to create her own mythology, to construct her own version of the story of her life. Kinetic, formally dazzling, and spectacularly original, this book is a funny and profound portrait of an unconventional family that makes us look anew at how language shapes our understanding of ourselves.

He loves his mama, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and G. I. Joe. But Brandon's life is anything but typical. Wise beyond his years, Brandon understands he's the only one in this world he can count on. It's an outlook that serves him well the day his mama leaves him behind at the Raleigh bus station and sets off to Canada with ""her destiny"" -- the latest man that she hopes will bring her happiness. The day his mother leaves, Brandon takes the first step toward shaping his own destiny. Soon he sends himself spending pleasant days playing with his cousins on his grandparents' farm and trying to forget the past. In the safety of that place, Brandon finally is able to trust the love of an adult to help iron out the wiry places until his nerves are as steady as any other boy's.But when Sophie Willard shows up a year later with a determined look in her eye and a new man in tow, Brandon's grandparents ignore a judge's ruling and flee the state with Brandon. Creating a new life and identity in a small Florida town, Brandon meets the people who will fill him with self-worth and self-respect. He slowly becomes involved with ""God's Hospital,"" a church run by the gregarious Sister Delores, a woman who is committed to a life of service for all members of the community, black and white, regardless of some townsfolk's disapproval.

Suddenly Elyse is willing to risk everything: her safe but stale marriage, her seemingly perfect life in an affluent Southern suburb, and her position in the community. She finds herself cutting through all the instincts that say ""no"" and instead lets ""yes"" happen. As Elyse embarks on a risky affair, her longtime friend Kelly and the other women in their book club begin to question their own decisions about love, sex, marriage, and freedom. There are consequences for Elyse, her family, and her circle of close friends, all of whom have an investment in her life continuing as normal. But is normal what she really wants after all? In the end it will take an extraordinary leap of faith for Elyse to find--and follow--her own path to happiness. An intelligent, sexy, absorbing tale and an honest look at modern-day marriage, Love in Mid Air offers the experience of what it's like to change the course of one's own destiny when finding oneself caught in mid air.

What the Constitution Means to Me,Heidi Schreck,literature,First published in 2020,/works/OL20936538W,/authors/OL7698689A/Heidi_Schreck,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28365460M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Theatre Communications Group|Language English,"When she was fifteen years old, Heidi Schreck earned money for her college tuition by giving speeches about the U.S. Constitution. Decades later, she traces the effect this document has had on four generations of women in her family. Deftly examining how the United States' founding principles are inextricably linked with our personal lives, Schreck also explores the ways in which their misuse has engendered violence and inherited trauma. With passion and wit, this galvanizing new play acknowledges the ways in which our Constitution has failed us while simultaneously offering hope that we may yet steer ourselves toward a better future.
