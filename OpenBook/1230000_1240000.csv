Yet children struggle with the same desires adults struggle with, are lured by the same lies adults fall prey to, and can find hope in the same source adults can find hope -- in Jesus. This manual helps counselors share Christ -- the way, the truth, and the life -- while tailoring interactions and teachings to the understanding of children. Articles are written by a wide range of biblical counselors, authors, and pastors who have worked with children for many years including Amy Baker, Julie Lowe, Marty Machowski, Jessica Thompson, Jonathan Holmes, Michael R. Emlet, Garrett Higbee, Edward T. Welch, Kevin Carson, Harvest USA, Charles Hodges, Joni and Friends, Bob Kellemen, and Pam Bauer. Caring for the Souls of Children equips counselors, parents, pastors, and other helpers who love children, to boldly trust in the sufficiency of Scripture for counseling. Edited by counselor and author Amy Baker, this in-depth resource begins with an overview of foundational principles for counseling children and addresses a different counseling topic in each subsequent chapter. Topics addressed include a wide variety of general and specific issues that children face including anxiety, anger, abuse, suicidal thoughts and actions, self-harm, shame, grief, disability, disease, sexual identity, and many others. - Publisher.

Every Christian struggles with sin and wants to be victorious in the fight. Higher life theology -- also known as Keswick theology -- offers a quick fix for this struggle. It teaches that there are two categories of Christians: those who are merely saved and those who have really surrendered to Christ -- or those who have Jesus as their Savior alone and those who have him as their Master as well. If Christians can simply ""let go and let God"" they can be free of struggling with sin and brought to that higher level of spiritual life. What could be wrong with that? A lot, it turns out. In No Quick Fix, a shorter and more accessible version of his book Let Go and Let God?, Andy Naselli critiques higher life theology from a biblical perspective. He shows that it leads not to freedom, but to frustration, because it promises something it has no power to deliver. Along the way, he tells the story of where higher life theology came from, describes its characteristics, and compares it to what the Bible really says about how we overcome sin and become more like Christ. - Publisher.

The God Genes Decoded II,R. A.

In a world that dictates that it is our religious, social, economic and racial differences that separate us from our neighbor, R.A. Waldron exposes these long held myths by decoding the creation stories of one of the world's oldest civilizations. The conditions that plague the world seem laden with despair and it's future appears fated for demise, but R.A. Waldron reveals that our intangible notions and concepts of destiny, the universe and nature are all within our personal and collective control. The God Genes Decoded is unique in that not only is the divine science of ancient Egypt deciphered without the misleading concepts that other authors conveniently employ in their literary work, but it recommends current and practical spiritual solutions that we can apply to our daily lives. This book will lay the foundation for all students of kaballah, priests of all faiths, and those unfamiliar with the subject who are interested in achieving a clearer understanding of the universe in which we dwell. You will be amazed by the simplicity with which R.A. Waldron has decoded the buried meanings of the ancient Egyptian texts to illustrate the organic harmony between science and religion, and to also reveal the unifying qualities within man and the universe. R. A. Waldron, a.k.a. Nu Heri Mensa Ogun, is part of a family of ancient priests who trace their lineage across many of humanity's earliest civilizations; including the civilizations of the Nile Valley, the Middle East, and the Mayan and Incans.

Yet who was this passionate missionary who carried the message of Christ throughout the Mediterranean world? The New Testament writings give us not one but two portraits of Paul. We read numerous details of Paul's life and relationships in the Book of Acts and we also find an additional set of details about Paul's activities in his letters. Yet how consistent are these two portraits? And which one gives us the most accurate picture of the historical Paul? In this volume Thomas E. Phillips examines the portrayals of Paul in recent biblical scholarship in the light of these two major NT portraits. Believing the apostolic conference at Jerusalem to be a watershed event, Phillips draws conclusions that help contemporary readers get a more accurate picture of Paul. - Publisher.

Miller investigates the role religion played in the family, village, tribe, and nation-state of ancient Israel. He situates Israel's religion in context where a variety of social forces affected beliefs, and where popular cults openly competed with the ""official"" religion. He makes extensive use of both epigraphic and artifactual evidence as he probes the complexities of Iron Age culture and society.  Volumes in the Library of Ancient Israel draw on multiple disciplines--such as archaeology, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, and literary criticism--to illuminate the everyday realities and social subtleties these ancient cultures experienced. This series employs sophisticated methods resulting in original contributions that depict the reality of the people behind the Hebrew Bible and interprets these insights for a wide variety of readers.

Reformation divided,Eamon Duffy,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL19717477W,/authors/OL404953A/Eamon_Duffy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 441,"Published to mark the 500th anniversary of the events of 1517, Reformation Divided explores the impact in England of the cataclysmic transformations of European Christianity in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The religious revolution initiated by Martin Luther is usually referred to as 'The Reformation', a tendentious description implying that the shattering of the medieval religious foundations of Europe was a single process, in which a defective form of Christianity was replaced by one that was unequivocally benign, 'the midwife of the modern world'. The book challenges these assumptions by tracing the ways in which the project of reforming Christendom from within, initiated by Christian 'humanists' like Erasmus and Thomas More, broke apart into conflicting and often murderous energies and ideologies, dividing not only Catholic from Protestant, but creating deep internal rifts within all the churches which emerged from Europe's religious conflicts. The book is in three parts: In 'Thomas More and Heresy', Duffy examines how and why England's greatest humanist apparently abandoned the tolerant humanism of his youthful masterpiece Utopia, and became the bitterest opponent of the early Protestant movement. 'Counter-Reformation England' explores the ways in which post-Reformation English Catholics accommodated themselves to a complex new identity as persecuted religious dissidents within their own country, but in a European context, active participants in the global renewal of the Catholic Church. The book's final section 'The Godly and the Conversion of England' considers the ideals and difficulties of radical reformers attempting to transform the conventional Protestantism of post-Reformation England into something more ardent and committed. In addressing these subjects, Duffy shines new light on the fratricidal ideological conflicts which lasted for more than a century, and whose legacy continues to shape the modern world. -   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They will also benefit from many of the services that the often well-financed public school system has to offer. Readers of this practical guide will learn how moms and dads have a strategic role to play in the ongoing development of their school-age children. Discover what the Bible says about education, the three most important things to teach your public-school child, how to shape your child through teachable moments, the importance of getting involved at school and why everyone should home-school, in addition to public school. - Publisher.

Here are illuminations that bring the words of the Bible alive for a contemporary audience. Some of the world's top calligraphers, working in a tradition all but replaced by the printing press centuries ago, invite us into a rich and varied creation. This second volume of The Art of The Saint John's Bible: A Reader's Guide takes up two great collections of biblical literature - Wisdom Books and Prophets."" ""The illuminations in Wisdom Books and Prophets draw on motifs from earlier illuminations and expand the visual vocabulary to strike at what is unique and important to these books. In Wisdom Books we find a number of well-known and beloved aphorisms, or ""words of wisdom."" Here calligraphic text treatments take center stage. However, these books also portray the divine in the female figure of Wisdom, presented visually in several large-scale illuminations. The prophets' messages are often dark and strange, reflecting the grief of exile but also hope. The illuminations throughout these pages reflect visions of man's inhumanity, but they also burst with the rainbows of God's promise and glory. Lavishing equal attention on the biblical passages and the artistic vision of The Saint John's Bible, this guide is offered to enhance your experience and reflection.""--BOOK JACKET.

We've all asked ourselves this question at some point, but few of us have found the path to lasting fulfilment.David Michie though he had achieved his life's goals - the high level job, the expensive city apartment, the luxury car, great holidays but a small voice was telling him he wasn't really happy. A chance remark from a naturopath sent him to his local Buddhist centre. There, he began the most important journey of his life.In this simple, but beautifully written book, David Michie opens the door to the core teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. With wry, self-deprecating humour, he shows us how he began to incorporate Buddhist practices into his daily life. he explains how he came to understand the difference between the temporary pleasures of ordinary life, and the profound sense of well-being and heart-felt serenity that comes from connecting with our inner nature.Every once in a while you come across an extraordinary book with the power to change your life.

God in the White House,Randall Herbert Balmer,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL2916520W,/authors/OL444228A/Randall_Herbert_Balmer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24276248M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2008|Publisher  HarperOne,              Harper San Francisco|Language English|Pages 243","How did we go from John F. Kennedy declaring that religion should play no role in the elections to Bush saying, ""I believe that God wants me to be president""?Historian Randall Balmer takes us on a tour of presidential religiosity in the last half of the twentieth century-from Kennedy's 1960 speech that proposed an almost absolute wall between American political and religious life to the soft religiosity of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society; from Richard Nixon's manipulation of religion to fit his own needs to Gerald Ford's quiet stoicism; from Jimmy Carter's introduction of evangelicalism into the mainstream to Ronald Reagan's co-option of the same group; from Bill Clinton's covert way of turning religion into a non-issue to George W. Bush's overt Christian messages, Balmer reveals the role religion has played in the personal and political lives of these American presidents.Americans were once content to disregard religion as a criterion for voting, as in most of the modern presidential elections before Jimmy Carter.But today's voters have come to expect candidates to fully disclose their religious views and to deeply illustrate their personal relationship to the Almighty. God in the White House explores the paradox of Americans' expectation that presidents should simultaneously trumpet their religious views and relationship to God while supporting the separation of church and state. Balmer tells the story of the politicization of religion in the last half of the twentieth century, as well as the ""religionization"" of our politics. He reflects on the implications of this shift, which have reverberated in both our religious and political worlds, and offers a new lens through which to see not only these extraordinary individuals, but also our current political situation.

Actress and Main Floor host Nancy Stafford (best known for her starring role as Michelle Thomas on Matlock) digs below our culture's fixation on outward appearance to show you that true beauty is more than skin-deep. ""Every woman has beauty,"" says Stafford, ""but not everyone sees it. I want you to see it."" In Beauty by the Book she bares her heart to readers, laying out the Scriptures, promises, and truths women need to know to find their true value. Her liberating reflections will help you see yourself as God sees you -- worthy, lovable, and beautiful.""Mirror, Mirror, on the W all...""  What do you see when you look in the mirror?  Do you see a unique individual created in the image of Beauty itself--one chosen, Cherished, and valued in the eyes of God? If not, you may be looking in the wrong mirror--one distorted by emotional wounds, lies from your past, or the unrealistic standards of our culture.  ""Everyone has beauty and worth,"" says Nancy Stafford, ""but not everyone sees it. I want you to see it.""  Nancy shares her own poignant story and holds up the true mirror of God's Word--inviting you to see yourself as God sees you, to absorb His truth, and to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the King is enthralled by your beauty!From the Trade Paperback edition.

And yet, there are ringing calls to form a distinct, 'thick' Christian counter-culture as perhaps the ultimate witness to the presence of the future, the coming of the Kingdom.""""Tullian Tchividjian, one of today's brightest young Christian leaders, makes a refreshing call for orthodoxy. He does not apologize for the gospel; he wears it like a red badge of courage. Read this book to recover the faith once for all delivered to the saints in fresh, courageous terms.""--Chuck Colson, founder of Prison Fellowship and author of The Faith""Tullian Tchividjian is the real deal. His life and his words speak in stereo. I love reading books that challenge the way I think. Unfashionable goes beyond that. It's counterintuitive. It's counter-cultural. And it's a must-read for those brave enough to really follow in the footsteps of Jesus."" --Mark Batterson, lead pastor of National Community Church in Washington D.C. and author of Wild Goose Chase""With the right balance of reproof and encouragement, critique and construction, Unfashionable displays with succinct, vivid, and engaging clarity the relevance of the gospel over the trivialities that dominate our lives and our churches right now..""--Michael Horton, J. Gresham Machen professor, Westminster Seminary in California, and host of White Horse Inn""Plainly, powerfully, and pastorally, Unfashionable gives a bird's-eye view of the real Christian life--Christ-centered, church-committed, kingdom-contoured, future-focused, and counter-cultural all the way. It makes for a truly nutritious read.""--J. I. Packer, professor of theology at Regent College and author of Knowing God ""In this windowless world, God, transcendence, and mystery have become less and less imaginable.... Everything's produced, managed, and solved 'this side of the ceiling,' which explains why so many people are restless and yearning, as I was, for meaning that transcends this world--for something and Someone different.""--from Unfashionable From the Hardcover edition.

Judas: The Definitive Collection of Gospels and Legends About the Infamous Apostle of Jesus,Marvin Meyer,religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL274404W?edition=ia%3Ajudasdefinitivec00meye,/authors/OL2629706A/Marvin_Meyer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24277210M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  HarperCollins|Language English,"Judas Iscariot has been demonized as the quintessential traitor, the disciple who betrayed his master for the infamous thirty pieces of silver. But the recent sensational discovery and publication of the long lost Gospel of Judas, with its remarkable portrayal of Judas Iscariot as the disciple closest to Jesus, raises serious new questions. Was Judas the only member of the Twelve who truly understood Jesus? Did Jesus secretly collaborate with Judas to set in motion the series of events that would redeem all of humankind? In search of answers, Marvin Meyer, one of the world's leading experts on the Gospel of Judas presents a collection of the earliest accounts of Judas, which together paint a fuller portrait of this most enigmatic disciple.This book presents the essential texts that deal with the figure of Judas, including New Testament writings, Gnostic documents, and other early and later Christian literature. These are the earliest known testimonies about Judas and include selections from the gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John, the Acts of the Apostles, and relevant passages from Paul. The centerpiece of the book is the Gospel of Judas, followed by excerpts from three other Gnostic texts—the Dialogue of the Savior, the Concept of Our Great Power, and the ""Round Dance of the Cross""—which may shed new light on the figure of Judas. A series of additional writings on Judas produced over the centuries provide glimpses of the vilification of Judas and the emergence of anti-Semitic themes.Meyer offers evidence of traitors before Judas—the Genesis story of Joseph's brothers who sold him into slavery, the duplicitous friend of the poet in Psalm 41, and Melanthius the goatherd in Homer's Odyssey—all of which raise the question of whether the story of Judas Iscariot could be simply a piece of religious fiction derived from earlier stories.Judas provides a rich collection of original sources that tell the story of Christianity's most infamous figure, offering the fullest understanding of Judas Iscariot's undeniable importance in the climax of Jesus's life.

Simon pioneered new approaches to understanding and defending political democracy in the wake of two world wars. Rather than break from a religious tradition that seemed to struggle against modernity and certain forms of democratic theory and practice, these thinkers instead looked back to the philosophy of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas to propel Catholic political philosophy forward. The profound influence of Maritain and Simon is manifest in the dramatic achievements of Vatican II and in the work of the scholars of political philosophy who learned from them. John P. Hittinger, one of the finest of these scholars, provides in Liberty, Wisdom, and Grace a comprehensive survey of the Thomists' contributions to contemporary political thought as well as a detailed analysis of their approach to democracy. Hittinger treats criticism of Maritain, including the work of Catholic political writer Aurel Kolnai, and discusses the alternative democratic visions of John Locke and David Richards. His portraits of thinkers who have wrestled with democracy in the Thomist tradition, such as Leo Strauss and John Paul II, are sensitive and engaging. Addressing questions of religion and philosophy broadly understood, the essays collected here offer a searching examination of democratic theory in the modern age.

Outside her window, two nuns were discussing what they could write in her obituary that could possibly be of any interest, since the twenty-four-year-old nun had never done anything worth noting. Therese was pleased, for she had always kept a low profile. With the posthumous publication of her spiritual autobiography in 1898, however, that low profile would vanish instantly.  She became one of the most beloved saints of all time, and her influence will expand dramatically because of Pope John Paul II's declaration that she is a Doctor of the Church. Amid growing interest in her writings comes the collected correspondence between her and a humble young seminarian, Maurice Belliere. Though they never met in person, they exchanged twenty-one letters that opened a window on the heart of Saint Therese that would have remained forever closed had Maurice not written to the Mother Superior at the convent asking for a nun to pray for him. The Mother Superior chose Therese, and in these conversational letters the Little Flower reveals herself in a way that we would never have known from her autobiography.  In his accompanying text, Bishop Patrick Ahern expertly leads the reader into the worlds of Maurice and Therese and reveals the full beauty of this saint's spirituality.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Versuch einer modernen Lösung der Judenfrage“ hat der aus Odessa stammende Arzt Leon Pinsker mit seinem Aufruf „Autoemancipation! Mahnruf an seine Stammesgenossen von einem russischen Juden“ eine kontroverse innerjüdische Diskussion ausgelöst. Angesichts der Pogrome in Rußland und des nicht abnehmendem Antisemitismus sah Pinsker das Projekt der Integration als gescheitert und die Hoffnung auf Gleichstellung der Juden als trügerisch an. Daher forderte er eine Abkehr von allen Assimilationsbestrebungen und die Ausbildung eines nationalen jüdischen Bewußtseins mit dem Ziel der Gründung eines eigenen Staates. Pinskers 1882 erschienene Schrift wird in diesem Band in der Originalfassung vorgelegt, ergänzt um die Protokolle der von Leon Pinsker einberufenen Kattowitzer Konferenz (1884) und der Korrespondenzen (Leon Pinsker, Isaak Rülf, Moses Moses, Sigismund Simmel), die rund um diese Konferenz der Chowewe-Zion-Vereine geführt wurden.

The study begins by engaging popular political pundits who wish top transform Christianity into an arm of the state. It then moves to examine some of the theological foundations proposed as support for the church's propping up of American political ideology. Finally, the study provides a more robust politics of the church by outlining how the church might act as a politics in itself. Thus the church may gain a political voice as church in such a way as to make the world know it stands in need of redemption. This is a far cry from the liberal attempt of the Social Gospel and many other evangelicals to transform the world into a pseudo-church by cultural and social control. Unlike attemps to engage culture on its own terms in the political arena or to escape politics by avoiding any public testimony to the Gospel, this study lays out a way for the church to act as church in the public square, witnessing to a Gospel concerned primarily about the universe's King and His future Kingdom.""

Der Preis des Messianismus: Briefe von Jacob Taubes an Gershom Scholem und andere Materialien,Jacob Taubes,religion,First published in 2000,/works/OL2439291W,/authors/OL337302A/Jacob_Taubes,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21629222M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2000|Publisher  Quodlibet|Language Italian|Pages 206,"Das Auffinden der in der Jerusalemer Jewish & University Library erhaltenen Briefe von Jacob Taubes an Gershom Scholem leistet einen entscheidenden Beitrag zum integrativen Verständnis der Verbindung, die zwischen diesen beiden außergewöhnlichen Persönlichkeiten auf menschlicher wie geistiger Ebene bestand; zugleich erscheinen die bisher zu diesem Thema veröffentlichten Texte in einem neuen Licht. Der vorliegende Band macht sich eine Zusammenstellung des gesamten Materials zur Aufgabe, das Taubes Scholem gewidmet hat; dabei wird deutlich, dass selbst die heikelsten biograpischen Aspekte in diesem komplizierten Verhältnis, im Grunde auf die Frage des Messianismus zurückgehen und eng verbunden damit auf eine unterschiedliche Interpretation von Paulus und Walter Benjamin.Das vorliegende Buch ist die durchgesehene deutsche Fassung der von E. Stimili besorgten italienischen Ausgabe mit dem Titel Il prezzo del Messianesimo. Lettere die Jacob Taubes a Gershom Scholem e altri scritti, erstmals erschienen im Jahr 2000 (Quodlibet-Verlag/Macerata). Die Autorin Elettra Stimilli lebt in Rom und arbeitet an der Università di Salerno. Sie hat fast alle Werke von Taubes übersetzt und herausgegeben und ist Autorin der ersten Monographie über ihn: ""Jacob Taubes. Sovranità e tempo messianico"" (J.T., Souveränität und messianische Zeit), Morcelliana, Brescia 2004. Zudem hat sie Essays zur philosophischen Deutung des Jüdischen und des Christentums verfasst, die stets auch Beziehungen zum gegenwärtigen Denken thematisieren. Die Übersetzerin Astrida Anna Ment, Jahrgang 1975, studierte in Würzburg und Urbino Germanistik, Theologie sowie Romanistik. Nach verschiedenen Tätigkeiten an der Universität und im Verlagswesen, promoviert sie derzeit im Fach Literaturwissenschaft.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book, now the most comprehensive and up to date single volume work in English, describes not only the main ideas and personalities of Christian history, its organisation and spirituality, but how it has changed politics, sex, and human society.Diarmaid MacCulloch ranges from Palestine in the first century to India in the third, from Damascus to China in the seventh century and from San Francisco to Korea in the twentieth. He is one of the most widely travelled of Christian historians and conveys a sense of place as arrestingly as he does the power of ideas. He presents the development of Christian history differently from any of his predecessors. He shows how, after a semblance of unity in its earliest centuries, the Christian church divided during the next 1400 years into three increasingly distanced parts, of which the western Church was by no means always the most important: he observes that at the end of the first eight centuries of Christian history, Baghdad might have seemed a more likely capital for worldwide Christianity than Rome. This is the first truly global history of Christianity.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

From the Counter-Reformation to the ascent of Francis I as the first Jesuit pope, The Jesuits presents an intimate look at one of the most important religious orders not only in the Catholic Church, but also the world. Markus Friedrich describes an organization that has deftly walked a tightrope between sacred and secular involvement and experienced difficulties during changing times, all while shaping cultural developments from pastoral care and spirituality to art, education, and science.  Examining the Jesuits in the context of social, cultural, and world history, Friedrich sheds light on how the order shaped the culture of the Counter-Reformation and participated in the establishment of European empires, including missionary activity throughout Asia and in many parts of Africa in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He also explores the place of Jesuits in the New World and addresses the issue of Jesuit slaveholders. The Jesuits often tangled with the Roman Curia and the pope, resulting in their suppression in 1773, but the order returned in 1814 to rise again to a powerful position of influence. Friedrich demonstrates that the Jesuit fathers were not a monolithic group and he considers the distinctive spiritual legacy inherited by Pope Francis.  With its global scope and meticulous attention to archival sources and previous scholarship, The Jesuits illustrates the heterogeneous, varied, and contradictory perspectives of this famed religious organization.

It is not a book about whether one should believe in Jesus, but about how Americans have believed in and portrayed him."" (From the Introduction)Jesus in America is a comprehensive exploration of the vital role that the figure of Jesus has played throughout American history. Written by one of our most distinguished historians, Richard Wightman Fox, this book provides a brilliant cultural history of Jesus in America from its origins to today, demonstrating how Jesus is the most influential symbolic figure in our history.Where else but America do people ask: What Would Jesus Do?What Would Jesus Drive?What Would Jesus Eat?Benjamin Franklin understood Jesus as a wise man worthy of imitation. Thomas Jefferson regarded him as a moral teacher. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln, which occurred on Good Friday, was popularly interpreted as paralleling the crucifixion of Jesus ... as one preacher put it, ""Jesus Christ died for the world, Abraham Lincoln died for his country."" Elizabeth Cady Stanton appropriated Jesus' message to champion women's rights. George W. Bush named Jesus as his favorite political philosopher -- and several other GOP candidates followed suit -- during the last presidential race. As we have seen in recent presidential elections, the name of Jesus is often thrust into the center of political debates, and many Americans regularly enlist Jesus, their ultimate arbiter of value, as the standard-bearer for their views and causes.Fox shows how Jesus influenced such major turning points in American history as:Columbus's voyage of discoveryThe arrival of the English puritans and Spanish missionariesThe American RevolutionThe abolition of slavery and the Civil WarLabor movementsSocial and cultural revolutions of the sixties and beyondThe swelling tide of Christian voices in the politics and entertainment of todayFox gives an expert, lively account of all the ways that Jesus is portrayed and understood in American culture. Extensively illustrated with images representing the multitude of American views of Jesus, Jesus in America reveals how fully and deeply Jesus is ingrained in the American experience.

Is she garbed in the traditional hijab and chador? Is she subservient to a male-dominated culture and religion, with few rights and little freedom? Does she grocery shop, do her nails, go to college, have sex? Who are these women?In this extraordinary and moving book, journalist Donna Gehrke-White provides a rare, revealing look into the hearts, minds, and everyday lives of Muslim women in America—a fast-rising population—and opens a window on a culture as diverse as it is misunderstood. Here, in their own words, are the many different voices of doctors, soccer moms, rebels, reformers, former political prisoners, survivors, activists—women of faith, courage, hope, and change—all Muslims, all Americans. There are women like Sahar Shaikh, who grew up on Girl Scouts and rock and roll in suburban Miami but felt that something was missing from her life until she took up the veil and returned to her spiritual roots; like Zainab Elberry, an Egyptian activist insurance executive in Nashville who sees no need for the hijab and no conflict between her feminism and her Muslim beliefs. We meet Cathy Drake, a convert from Virginia who could be the perfect Republican red-state mom, home-schooling her kids and driving a minivan, except that Cathy wears the traditional scarf and converted to Islam after 9/11. There’s Salma Syed, who escaped the religious intolerance, terror, and violence of her Indian homeland to find peace and security in the American suburbs. And there are pioneers like Sarah Eltantawi, who are trying to advance women’s rights in the mosque, and W. L. Cati, a once obedient housewife who left both her abusive husband and her faith in order to help other women escape similar fates. Candid, moving, fascinating, and ultimately inspiring, The Face Behind the Veil is a remarkable chronicle of identity and faith, a celebration of women who are changing the face of America and Islam, even as America influences who they are and what they believe.

King of the confessors,Thomas Hoving,religion,First published in 1981,/works/OL517249W?edition=ia%3Akingofconfessors00hovi,/authors/OL36030A/Thomas_Hoving,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24747606M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1981|Publisher  Simon and Schuster|Language English|Pages 365,"When first published, in 1981, King of the Confessors caused a furore.   Thomas Hoving was director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1967 to 1977,   during which time his commitment to the popularisation of art aroused much controversy.   After leaving the museum he published two books - Tutankhamun: The Untold   Story and King of the Confessors - which were controversial because   they contained revelations about the Museum's (and his own) somewhat dubious   activities in acquiring and disposing of works of art. King of the Confessors has three main protagonists: a magnificent   cross, intricately carved from walrus ivory in the 12th century; Topic Ante   Mimara, the shady Yugoslav owner of the cross; and Thomas Hoving, in 1963 a   curatorial assistant at the Metropolitan Museum, who was determined at all costs   to acquire the cross for the Museum. Its main secondary character is James Rorimer,   then Director of the Museum, whom Hoving had to persuade to pay the $600,000   which Mimara was demanding for the cross. Adopting the style of a thriller - which upset some strait-laced critics of   the first edition - Hoving tells a gripping story of his dealings with Mimara   and Rorimer as he tried to acquire the cross, and gives a no less intriguing   account of his attempts to discover the origin of the cross itself and understand   its complex iconography. In revising the book for this new edition, he draws   upon new sources which make the story of its acquisition even more exciting,   and adds significantly to his account of the cross's origin and iconography.Of particular interest is Hoving's discussion of the 'Bury St Edmunds connection':   the question whether the cross was created, as he believes, by Master Hugo at   the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds. In the new edition Hoving argues strongly against   those who doubt this attribution, and also defends vigorously his view that   the cross expresses anti-Jewish sentiments.

Wright has produced a succession of connected volumes that explore the nature and origins of Christianity. Wright has consistently argued that Christianity, while indebted to Second Temple Judaism, represents an explosive new development. With major books on method and background, Jesus, and the resurrection already in print, in Paul and the Faithfulness of God, Wright added a comprehensive study of the Apostle to the Gentiles. Wright's Paul, as well as his reading of Christianity, is not without its detractors. In The Paul Debate, Wright answers his critics. The five chapters represent a response to the five most questioned elements of his understanding of Paul. The first chapter takes up the question of Paul's theological coherence, particularly the way in which his Jewish context, and the story about Israel he inherited, interacted with what he came to believe about Jesus, a Christological story. Chapter two follows on by tackling the debate over the background, origin, and implications of Paul's Christology. The third chapter addresses the questions of covenant and cosmos, narrative and apocalyptic. Chapter four focuses on the debate over Paul's view of who constitutes the people of God; this chapter also addresses the question of whether justification belongs to Paul's soteriology or his ecclesiology, or somehow to both. The final chapter then traces debates about method, both Paul's and ours, as well as questions of discovery and presentation, again, both Paul's and ours.

He appears as a shepherd, a teacher, a healer, an enthroned god; he is an infant, a youth, and a bearded elder. But he is never dead. When he appears with the cross, he stands in front of it, serene, resurrected. The world around him is ablaze with beauty. These are images of paradise—paradise as this world, permeated and blessed by the presence of God.But once he perished, dying was virtually all Jesus seemed able to do.Saving Paradise offers a fascinating new lens on the history of Christianity, from its first centuries to the present day, asking how its early vision of beauty evolved into a vision of torture, and what changes in society and theology marked that evolution.

Together they produced a dynamic body of ideas that has had a lasting impact on the study of religion, philosophy, and literary criticism.  Drawing from Benjamin's and Scholem's ideas on messianism, language, and divine justice, this book traces the intellectual exchange through the early decades of the twentieth century—from Berlin, Bern, and Munich in the throws of war and revolution to Scholem's departure for Palestine in 1923. It begins with a close reading of Benjamin's early writings and a study of Scholem's theological politics, followed by an examination of Benjamin's proposals on language and the influence these ideas had on Scholem's scholarship on Jewish mysticism. From there the book turns to their ideas on divine justice—from Benjamin's critique of original sin and violence to Scholem's application of the categories to the prophets and Bolshevism. Metaphysics of the Profane is the first book to make this early period available to a wider audience, revealing the intricate structure of this early intellectual partnership on politics and theology.

Officially known as Pesantren Daarut Tauhid, this pesantren was located in Bandung and flourished at the beginning of a period of Islamic resurgence in Indonesia. More commonly referred to as the Bengkel Akhlaq, this ‘Workshop for Morality’ exerted a special appeal to groups of young urban Muslims, particularly students. Its founder was H. K. Abdullah Gymnastiar, popularly known as Aa Gym, who later went on to become one of Indonesia’s most important Muslim preachers and television celebrities. The Workshop for Morality is a superb work of both historical and ethnographic relevance that reflects the capacity of its author, Dindin Solahudin, to capture a critical moment in the development of Islam in contemporary Indonesian society.

It illuminates the guidelines and key principles embodied in the noble Eight-Fold Path and the traditional Three Enlightenment Trainings common to all schools of Buddhism:Wisdom Training: Developing clear vision, insight, and inner understanding -- seeing reality and ourselves as we really are.Ethics Training: Cultivating virtue, self-discipline, and compassion in what we say and do.Meditation Training: Practicing mindfulness, concentration, and awareness of the present moment.With lively stories, meditations, and spiritual practices, Awakening the Buddha Within is an invaluable text for the novice and experienced student of Buddhism alike.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Contemporary critics of the revivalists often depicted them as anxious and outdated religious opponents of a modern, urban nation. Early historical accounts likewise portrayed tent revivalists as Victorian hold-outs, bent on re-establishing nineteenth-century values and religion in a new America. In this revisionist work, Josh McMullen argues that, contrary to these stereotypes, big tent revivalists actually participated in the shift away from Victorianism and helped in the construction of a new consumer culture in the United States. How did the United States became the most consumer-driven and yet one of the most religious societies in the western world? McMullen shows that revivalists and their audiences reconciled the Protestant ethic of salvation with the emerging consumer ethos by cautiously unlinking Christianity from Victorianism and joining it to the new, emerging consumer culture. Under the Big Top helps to explain the continued appeal of both the therapeutic and the salvific worldview to many Americans as well as the ambivalence that accompanies this combination. - Publisher.

Armana was also the city in which Tutankhamun, today the most famous pharaoh of ancient Egypt, spend the first part of his childhood. Although Armana has become a byword for religious and artistic innovation, it is often difficult to disentangle myth from fact, speculation from reality. In this well-illustrated study, Barbara Watterson, one of the most accomplished of modern Egyptologists, discusses and brings up to date the many theories that abound about the period.

"The Church of England, 1688-1832","Gibson, William",religion,First published in 2000,/works/OL3266447W,/authors/OL532624A/Gibson_William,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6784537M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2000|Publisher  Routledge|Language English,"This book is a wide ranging new history of a key period in the history of the church in England, from the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688-89 to the Great Reform Act of 1832. This was a tumultuous time for both church and state, when the relationship between religion and politics was at its most fraught. The Church of England 1688 - 1832 considers the consequences of these important events and the rapid changes it brought to  the Anglican Church and to national politics.Aspects of the social history of the Church are also discussed, including the role of the Church in eighteenth century culture, and the development of nationhood. Anglican attitudes to European Protestantism and Methodism are also evaluated.Drawing on a wide range of contemporary sources, The Church of England 1688-1832 presents evidence of the widespread Anglican commitment to harmony between those of differing religious views and suggests that High and Low Churchmanship was less divergent than usually assumed. This is both a detailed history of the Church in the eighteenth century and a fresh and stimulating re-evaluation of the nature of Anglicanism and its role in society.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 158,"Most of us need to feel that we matter in some way; perhaps this explains the high value placed on titles, corner offices, and even fleeting celebrity. But most of us also need to feel that we are good people. In this luminous yet practical book of spiritual advice, Harold Kushner bridges the gap between these seemingly irreconcilable needs, showing us how even our smallest daily actions can become stepping stones toward integrity.Drawing on the stories of his own congregants, on literature, current events and, above all, on the Biblical story of Jacob, the worldly trickster who evolves into a man of God --Kushner addresses some of the most persistent dilemmas of the human condition: Why do decent people so often violate their moral standards? How can we pursue justice without giving in to the lure of revenge? How can we turn our relationships with family and friends into genuine sources of meaning?  Persuasive and sympathetic, filled with humanity and warmth, Living a Life That Matters is a deeply rewarding book. From the Trade Paperback edition.

God has a plan for the rest of your life. Are they the same?  You have expectations for how your life will play out, and you hope those plans will become realities.  But what if God's plan for your life is far different from what you had in mind? Can you accept that? Will you surrender your goals for God's?  Kay Warren had a plan. Together with her husband, Rick Warren, author of the megaseller The Purpose Driven Life, she planned that after her kids were grown, she'd travel the world, teaching and encouraging couples in ministry. It was a good plan. But it wasn't what God had in mind for her.  In a startling wake-up call, Kay discovered the shocking realities of the AIDS pandemic in Africa while reading a magazine. 'I want to use you!' she heard God say. That began the struggle---first to avoid God's call and then to surrender herself to God.  She cried out to God, 'Why are you bothering me with this? There's nothing I can do about it. I'm just an ordinary person. What could one person do about such a gigantic problem' But God had grabbed her attention and wouldn't let go.  If you've ever struggled with knowing and doing God's will, this book is for you. With raw honesty, Kay goes straight to the heart of the matter: the bottom line is surrender. Will you trust God?  Along the way she'll introduce you to others---people like you---who have said yes to God and have made a difference in the world. Using their skills, energy, faith, and a willingness to take risks, they became powerful instruments of change and tools in God's hands.  Giving in to God isn't easy. It's not for cowards. It's the boldest, riskiest step you'll ever take. This dangerous surrender can bring both joy and pain, both heartache and ecstasy, but it enables you to know God in a far deeper way than ever before.  I had to make a conscious decision. Would I retreat to my comfortable life and to my settled plans? Or would I surrender to God's call and let my heart engage with a cause such as AIDS that I was pretty sure would include buckets of pain and sorrow? I felt like I was standing on the edge of a giant precipice; I couldn't go back, and yet the way forward looked like stepping into a void.  Kay Warren took that step, choosing to dangerously surrender to God. That decision transformed her life, marriage, and future. She invites you to do the same.  You'll benefit most by discussing this book with others. A Readers' Group Discussion Guide is provided in the back of the book. Additional help can be found at www.kaywarren.com.

""--  ""Judaism and World Religions is essential for a Jewish theological understanding of the various issues in encounters with the other major religions. With passion and clarity, Brill argues that in today's world of strong religious passions and intolerance, it is necessary to go beyond secular tolerance toward moderate religious positions. Brill outlines strategies for Jews who want to remain true to traditional sources while interacting with the diversity of the world's religions. With insight and scholarship, Alan Brill crisply outlines the Jewish approaches to other religions for an age of globalization""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The perplexing event has not been adequately accounted for by historians in their large-scale assessments of how and why the Holocaust occurred. In this gripping new analysis, Alon Confino draws on an array of archives across three continents to propose a penetrating new assessment of one of the central moral problems of the twentieth century. To a surprising extent, Confino demonstrates, the mass murder of Jews during the war years was powerfully anticipated in the culture of the prewar years. The author shifts his focus away from the debates over what the Germans did or did not know about the Holocaust and explores instead how Germans came to conceive of the idea of a Germany without Jews. He traces the stories the Nazis told themselves-where they came from and where they were heading-and how those stories led to the conclusion that Jews must be eradicated in order for the new Nazi civilization to arise. The creation of this new empire required that Jews and Judaism be erased from Christian history, and this was the inspiration-and justification-for Kristallnacht. As Germans imagined a future world without Jews, persecution and extermination became imaginable, and even justifiable""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Known worldwide, Sir John Templeton is a forward-thinking, incisive, and progressive investor, philanthropist, and author. A man dedicated to promoting the moral and spiritual progress of humanity, Sir John believes that the limitless potential of religion needs to be unlocked. Progress in religion is the great goal in his life.Templeton’s commitment to increasing our knowledge of spiritual information inspired the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, the Humility Theology Information Center, and the Center of Theological Inquiry at Princeton Seminary. Across the world, Templeton has piloted and inspired the development of foundations, centers, and publications dedicated to spiritual understanding.Herrmann creates a verbal picture of Templeton: the barefoot Tennessee boy who ""inherited some rather creative genes,"" the Yale student and Oxford Rhodes Scholar, the southern gentleman, devoted husband and father, the frugal business man. Readers will learn of Templeton's successful business ideas and practices. Business people, theologians, and scientists will benefit from the Templeton challenge to look beyond the walls created by human ego. This biography of the life of Sir John Templeton is an inspiration for one's own search for meaning and spiritual expression.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Christian Martyrs under Islam explains how Christians across the early Islamic caliphate slowly converted to the faith of the Arab conquerors and how small groups of individuals rejected this faith through dramatic acts of resistance, including apostasy and blasphemy.    Using previously untapped sources in a range of Middle Eastern languages, Christian Sahner introduces an unknown group of martyrs who were executed at the hands of Muslim officials between the seventh and ninth centuries CE. Found in places as diverse as Syria, Spain, Egypt, and Armenia, they include an alleged descendant of Muhammad who converted to Christianity, high-ranking Christian secretaries of the Muslim state who viciously insulted the Prophet, and the children of mixed marriages between Muslims and Christians. Sahner argues that Christians never experienced systematic persecution under the early caliphs, and indeed, they remained the largest portion of the population in the greater Middle East for centuries after the Arab conquest. Still, episodes of ferocious violence contributed to the spread of Islam within Christian societies, and memories of this bloodshed played a key role in shaping Christian identity in the new Islamic empire.     Christian Martyrs under Islam examines how violence against Christians ended the age of porous religious boundaries and laid the foundations for more antagonistic Muslim-Christian relations in the centuries to come.

In 2004, 27-year-old Stephanie Saldaña traveled to Syria on a Fulbright fellowship to study the role of the prophet Jesus in Islam. She was also fleeing a broken heart. It was not an ideal time to be an American in the Middle East--the United States had recently invaded Iraq, refugees were flooding into Damascus, and dark rumors swirled that Syria might be next to come under American attack. Miserable and lonely, Stephanie left Damascus to visit an ancient Christian monastery carved into the desert cliffs. In that beautiful, austere setting, she confronted her wavering faith and met Frédéric, a young French novice monk. As they set out to explore the mysteries entwining Christianity and Islam, Stephanie slowly realized that she had found God again--and that she was in love with Frédéric. But would Frédéric choose God or Stephanie?--From publisher description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Building on the findings of Tucker's first monograph, You Belong to Christ: Paul and the Formation of Social Identity in 1 Corinthians 1-4, this work expands the focus to the rest of 1 Corinthians. The study addresses the way Paul forms Christ-movement identity and the kind of identity that emerges from his kinship formation. It examines the way previous Jewish and gentile social identities continue but are also transformed ""in Christ."" It then provides case studies from 1 Corinthians that show the way social-scientific criticism and ancient source material provide insights concerning Paul's formational goals. The first looks at the way Roman water practices and patronage influence baptismal practices in Corinth. The next uncovers the challenges associated with the transformation of the Roman household when it functions as sacred space within the ekklesia. The final study investigates the way Paul uses apocalyptic discourse to recontextualize the Corinthians' identity in order to remind them that God, rather than the Roman Empire, is in control of history.

""Tenochitlan, the Aztec city, was the creation of war. The courage and stamina of its young fighting men was indisputable. In the title work of this pathbreaking collection of essays, Inga Clendinnen discusses why warfare was so central to Aztec society and the ways in which the Aztecs understood their relationship to the forces governing the world and the heavens. Aztec rhetoric and Aztec ritual were unified in the endeavor to sustain a social order sufficiently in harmony with the natural order. Subsequent essays examine the survival of Yucatec Maya culture under Spanish conquest, the role of ""religion"" in sixteenth-century Mexico, and Hernando Cortes and the conquest of Mexico.

Godly Seed: American Evangelicals Confront Birth Control, 1873-1973, examines how mid-twentieth-century evangelical leaders eventually followed the mainstream into a quiet embrace of contraception, complemented by a brief acceptance of abortion. It places this change within the context of historic Christian teaching regarding birth control, including its origins in the early church and the shift in arguments made by the Reformers of the sixteenth century. The book explores the demographic effects of this transition and asks: did the delay by American evangelicals leaders in accepting birth control have consequences? At the same time, many American evangelicals are rethinking their acceptance of birth control even as a majority of the nation's Roman Catholics are rejecting their church's teaching on the practice. Raised within a religious movement that has almost uniformly condemned abortion, many young evangelicals have begun to ask whether abortion can be neatly isolated from the issue of contraception. A significant number of evangelical families have, over the last several decades, rejected the use of birth control and returned decisions regarding family size to God. Given the growth of the evangelical movement, this pioneering work will have a large-scale impact. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Most women (if they're honest) see the selfishness of Sapphira or the deception of Delilah. They catch of glimpse of Jezebel's take-charge pride or Eve's disastrous disobedience. Like Bathsheba, Herodias, and the rest, today's modern woman is surrounded by temptations, exhausted by the demands of daily living, and burdened by her own desires.So what's a good girl to do? Learn from their lives, says beloved humor writer Liz Curtis Higgs, and by God's grace, choose a better path. In Bad Girls of the Bible, Higgs offers a unique and clear-sighted approach to understanding those ""other women"" in Scripture, combining a contemporary retelling of their stories with a solid, verse-by-verse study of their mistakes and what lessons women today can learn from them.Whether they were ""Bad to the Bone,"" ""Bad for a Season, but Not Forever"" or only ""Bad for a Moment,"" these infamous sisters show women how not to handle the challenges of life. With her trademark humor and encouragement, Liz Curtis Higgs teaches us how to avoid their tragic mistakes and joyfully embrace grace.From the Hardcover edition.

But, as Cullen Murphy shows in this provocative new book, not only did its offices survive into the twentieth century, in the modern world its spirit is more influential than ever. Traveling from freshly opened Vatican archives to the detention camps of Guantánamo to the filing cabinets of the Third Reich, he traces the Inquisition and its legacy. God’s Jury encompasses the diverse stories of the Knights Templar, Torquemada, Galileo, and Graham Greene. Established by the Catholic Church in 1231, the Inquisition continued in one form or another for almost seven hundred years. Though associated with the persecution of heretics and Jews—and with burning at the stake—its targets were more numerous and its techniques more ambitious. The Inquisition pioneered surveillance and censorship and “scientific” interrogation. As time went on, its methods and mindset spread far beyond the Church to become tools of secular persecution. With vivid immediacy and authority, Murphy puts a human face on a familiar but little-known piece of our past, and argues that only by understanding the Inquisition can we hope to explain the making of the present"" --Publisher description.

An independent scholar with a background in journalism, Najovits has based his book on careful reading and thorough analyses, using all the best scholarship and translations of Egyptian sources, with broader results than Claude Traunecker in the Gods of Egypt (CH, Apr '02). Beginning with the transition out of Neolithic ""agro-sedentary society"" along the Nile with its need to give expression in writing, architecture, and art, Najovits identifies and compares those religious concepts for which the peculiar, nearly isolated Egyptian landscape with its totemic elements allowed the development of profound metaphors of meaning. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-level undergraduates and above. --CHOICE February 2004  Najovits provides a remarkably evenhanded introductory survey of Egypt.... Najovits contends that scholarly focus on ancient Greece and Rome and on Christianity and Judaism has tended to obscure Egyptian contributions to the development of culture. Egyptian religion was highly original, he says: ""Never before had such an elaborate religion and such an all-inclusive mythology been invented."" As to its lasting contributions, the Egyptians, he says, invented the belief that the body could be preserved and stay alive after death. They were also, he claims, the first monotheistic culture, although monotheism waxed and waned under various pharaohs. They developed a belief in a savior god, Osiris, whose resurrection led to a belief in the afterlife. Najovits even concludes that the holy family of Osiris, Isis and Horus offers the mythological foundations upon which later cultures constructed their own foundational holy families (e.g., Jesus, Mary and Joseph). Egypt also provided examples of early jurisprudence and political systems, primarily in its extensive legal codes and its focus on kingship. On balance, Najovits offers a detailed and original historical survey of Egypt as a cradle of civilization. --Publishers Weekly: July 21, 2003  A French specialist in systems of religious belief recounts his exploration of the Egyptian patrimony society from 3100 BC to AD 395. The first volume looks at the matrix from which the Egyptian religion, political system, and contexts emerged. The second will trace how Egyptians developed distinctive features to address their own concerns. --(c)2003 Book News, Inc.     Product Description    An award-winning writer and international journalist leads the general reader through ancient Egypt, exploring the maze of facts and fantasies, and examines Egypt's place in the history of religion and monotheism in particular. He shows how Egypt both influenced and mystified other civilizations for centuries.     Writing in an easy to read narrative literary style while respecting the norms of Egyptological scholarship, the author examines the contradictory opinions of major Egyptologists (and the major loonies), and brings us closer to Egypt's core meaning and influence. Along the way, he illuminates the enchanting, imaginative beauty of the Egyptian saga. Ancient Egypt built a society on a remarkable mixture of the new, the useful and the beautiful, while retaining primitive magic, obscurantism, and the infantile but extraordinarily poetic. Egypt was also one of the most optimistic nations ever founded, inventing optimistic answers to many of man's fundamental questions.    Volume I, situates the Egyptian religion, political system and society within the contexts some of them stretching back as far as before c. 4000 BC of the early history of religion, mythology, technology, art, psychology, sociology, geography and migrations of peoples. It surveys the religious underpinnings of the society, including the founding of the first nation - and the first nation to proclaim its sacred nature. Divine kingship, the holy city and capital city were invented here.    (Volume II discusses the major consequences that arose from Egypt's system. The religious, funerary, afterlife and societal views of Egyptians are compared to the other major religions and societies. Their probable influence on Greek religion and on Hebrew and Christian monotheisms is carefully traced, as are Egypto-Hebrew relations. The highlights of Egypt's religious, political, colonial, artistic and literary life are examined as well as the subsequent decline of Egypt.)

Stace that lays out his philosophy of mysticism and compiles writings on mystical experience from across religious traditions. The book’s comprehensive selections met with broadly positive responses.  An introductory chapter lays out Stace’s philosophy and psychology of mysticism. He defines the principal characteristic of mystical experience as ""the apprehension of an ultimate nonsensuous unity in all things"",and differentiates it from occult, parapsychological phenomena, visions, voices, and anything ""misty"" or vague. Stace distinguishes between two types of mystical experience: extrovertive mysticism experiences unity in the world through the physical senses, while an introvertive type experiences unity in the self. Stace sees introvertive mysticism as more important and the focus of The Teachings of the Mystics. He proposes that there is a core to mystical experience, which is more basic and important than superficial differences over time and across cultures. This hypothesis can only be justified by a survey of mystics’ descriptions of their experiences – the book purports to be that. Stace chooses texts that describe mystical experience, rather than interpret or analyse it.""

It also encompasses attitudes, emotions, values, and practices whose meanings cannot be adequately captured in verbal assertions but require effective expression in forceful images, portrayals, and enactments of a nonliteral sort. Indeed, the world s religious traditions are each marked by rich and distinctive symbols. In ""More Than Discourse,"" Donald A. Crosby discusses the nature of symbols in religion and investigates symbols appropriate for religious naturalism or what he terms Religion of Nature. This is a religious outlook that holds the natural world to be the only world; it is sacred but without any supernatural domain or presence underlying it. Warning against a too-literalistic approach to any religion by either its adherents or its critics, Crosby discusses the nature and roles of religious symbols, how they work, and their particular kinds of truth or falsity. A set of criteria for evaluating the effectiveness and meaning of religious symbols is provided along with explorations of specific symbols Crosby finds to be highly significant for Religion of Nature.

Signposts to Silence. Metaphysical mysticism,J.S. Krüger,religion,First published in 2018,/works/OL20927955W,/authors/OL8010857A/J.S._Krüger,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 570,"Signposts to Silence provides a theoretical map of what it terms ‘metaphysical mysticism’: the search for the furthest, most inclusive horizon, the domain of silence, which underlies the religious and metaphysical urge of humankind in its finest forms. Tracing the footsteps of pioneers of this exploration, the investigation also documents a number of historical pilgrimages from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds. Such mountaineers of the spirit, who created paths trodden by groups of followers over centuries and in some cases millennia, include Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu, Siddhattha and Jesus, Sankara and Fa-tsang, Plato and Plotinus, Isaac Luria and Ibn Arabi, Aquinas and Hegel. Such figures, teachings and traditions (including the religions of ‘Judaism’, ‘Christianity’ and ‘Islam’; ‘Hinduism’, ‘Buddhism’ and ‘Taoism’) are understood as, at their most sublime, not final destiny and the end of the road, but signposts to a horizon of ultimate silence. The hermeneutical method employed in tracking such pioneers involves four steps:  • sound historical-critical understanding of the context of the various traditions and figures    • reconstruction of the subjective intentional structure of such persons and their teachings    • design, by the author, of a theoretical map of the overall terrain of ‘metaphysical mysticism’, on   which all such journeys of the spirit are to be located, while providing a theoretical context for understanding them tendentionally (i.e. taking the ultimate drift of their thinking essentially to transcend their subjective intentions)    • drawing out, within the space available, some political (taken in a wide sense) implications from the above, such as religio-political stances as well as ecological and gender implications.  Continuing the general direction of thought within what the author endorses to be the best in metaphysical mysticism in its historical manifestations, the book aims to contribute to peace amongst religions in the contemporary global cultural situation. It relativizes all claims to exclusive, absolute truth that might be proclaimed by any religious or metaphysical, mystical position, while providing space for not only tolerating, but also affirming the unique value and dignity of each. This orientation moves beyond the stances of enmity or indifference or syncretism or homogenisation of all, as well as that of mere friendly toleration. It investigates the seemingly daunting and inhospitable yet immensely significant Antarctica of the Spirit, the ‘meta’-space of silence behind the various forms of wordy ‘inter’-relationships. It affirms pars pro toto, totum pro parte, and pars pro parte: that each religious, mystical and metaphysical orientation in its relative singularity represents or contains the whole and derives value from that, and that each represents or contains every other. This homoversal solidarity stimulating individual uniqueness is different from and in fact implies criticism of the process of globalisation. While not taking part in a scientific argument as such, Signposts to Silence aims at promoting an understanding of science and metaphysical mysticism as mutual context for each other, and it listens to a number of voices from the domain of science that understand this.

Filosoof Wim Van Moer stelt deze intuïtieve, ook onder atheïsten wijdverspreide overtuiging ter discussie. Deze analyse onthult dat de religieuze ervaring niet verbonden hoeft te zijn met een geloof in een bovennatuurlijke entiteit of realiteit. Geïnspireerd door Leo Apostel en in de voetsporen van William James en Erich Fromm, betoogt de auteur dat deze tegenstrijdigheid, zelfs binnen een radicaal atheïstisch vertoog, niet automatisch geldig is. Van Moer staaft deze stelling met een meeslepende fenomenologische analyse van de religieuze ervaring, die uitmondt in een theoretisch model waarmee hij religieuze ervaringen binnen een atheïstische context kan onderzoeken.

This study initially conceived of as a philological exploration of historical manuscripts has been transformed into a study of ‘living manuscripts’ – the contemporary narratives of the custodians at Pamijahan. As elsewhere in the Islamic world, tarekat and ziarah intersect in popular practice at Pamijahan. Dr Christomy explores this intersecting world, explaining the steps of his own research investigations that enfold as a journey of discovery as he proceeds. This investigation involves the search for traces of Tarekat Shattiriyyah in Pamijahan, given the pervasive presence of Tarekat Qadirriyah-Nashabandiyyah throughout Tasikmalaya. That Tarekat Shattiriyyah survives to this day is itself evidence of the tenacity that its historical roots have established in a particular place.

What is my divine purpose? Why do I live in this dry place? The answers to these questions and more can be found in the wilderness. Are we really hungry for the truth? Are we willing to find what is really missing in our lives? God has a great purpose for those willing to let Him show them who He is. The wilderness experience is the transforming journey we take towards understanding our life's purpose and true prosperity (dwelling in God's Presence). In this book we will be challenged to face the truth about ourselves as well as the challenges of isolation, rejection, discontentment, emptiness, vulnerability and pride. In each challenge we face, we will gain a greater knowledge of who God is and our place in His plan. This understanding will empower us to endure the natural suffering the wilderness experience presents so that we can become one with Him. Join me in this journey of enlightenment as ""Humbly Submitting to Change - The Wilderness Experience"" inspires us to be filled with a deeper passion for God to fulfill our life's purpose!

Diese Spannung findet sich auch deutlich in der Theologie: Für die einen ist ihre Gendertheorie ebenso bedeutsam wie ihre Öffentlichkeitstheorie, ihre Einlassungen zur Verkörperung der Versammlung, ihr Subjektdenken und ihre Reflexionen über Anerkennung. Die anderen scheinen abgestoßen durch ihren Kritikbegriff und ihre Delegitimierung überkommener Ordnungen, die mitunter als massive Kirchenkritik aufgefasst wird. Die Beiträge des interdisziplinären Bandes gehen grundsätzlicher den theologischen Rezeptionsmöglichkeiten und -grenzen der Butler'schen Philosophie im Spiegel der theologischen Einzeldisziplinen nach.

Reformed theology today,Sarel P. Van der Walt,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL23501178W,/authors/OL8909046A/Sarel_P._Van_der_Walt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 241,"This book is unique and of great importance for theologians from diverse traditions but who all share the relevance of the academic Reformed discourse. The book focuses on, and forms part of celebrating 500 years since the start of the Reformation during the 16th century. Its purpose is to commemorate the quincentenary anniversary of the Reformation in Europe and to indicate the way in which the rich legacy of this important period in the history of the church and society still influences globally the theological landscape in the fields of Practical Theology, Missiology and Ethics. Specific attention is given to the manner in which the core principles of the Reformation can be utilised for these disciplines and applied in a contemporary context. The Reformation changed the ecclesiastical landscape of the day and still provides the benchmark for theological principles and praxis in many Protestant denominations. This book illustrates and underscores the practical-theological legacy and importance of the Reformation for church and society. The collected works by various theologians reflect on the impact of Reformed Theology on their respective fields of expertise. The original research is based on literature studies and has not been published previously in any form. Its aim is to stimulate discourse in Theology and related disciplines. Although the chapters represent different perspectives, the collective aim is to propose the vast impact of the Reformational views as they relate to the current context. The target audience is Reformed theologians. This book focuses on ways in which the legacy of the Reformation addresses practical and relevant issues for 21st-century believers, scholars and churches. It explores inter alia important homiletical and liturgical aspects of the Reformation and contemplates the importance of continual reformation in this regard. Furthermore, it discusses a Reformed approach to apologetics, evaluates the driving forces behind the Reformation of the 16th century and its relevance to missions today as well as examines the sola Scriptura principle of the Reformation and provides a critical perspective on Prosperity Theology. Several pastoral themes take centre stage before various aspects of xenophobia and civil prejudice are being investigated – both being very relevant topics throughout the world today. The book also focuses on hermeneutics and ethics in a quest for a biblical ethical approach as well as congregational hymns in the Reformed churches of South Africa today. The research outcomes are relevant not only for the South African context, but also globally.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ecodomy - Life in its fullness,Ernest van Eck,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL20930806W,/authors/OL8011862A/Ernest_van_Eck,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 205,"This book provides a coherent and conceptual portrayal of aspects of the theological research theme, entitled Ecodomy (literally meaning to ‘build a house’). In its figurative meaning the term Ecodomy addresses the theme, ‘life in its fullness’. This fullness of life entails a polarity which is inherently part of life, namely its brokenness and its wholeness. From various theological disciplines, namely Old Testament Studies, New Testament Studies, Systematic Theology, Church History and Practical Theology, both the brokenness and wholeness are addressed theologically. Every chapter focuses on a specific theological discipline, while the combination of theological disciplines, addresses the brokenness and wholeness of life as coherent concept. One pole does not exclude the other. Brokenness is visible in current or recent very relevant societal challenges, such as racism and xenophobia, apartheid, foreignness and exclusivism, leadership crises and violence. In contrast, wholeness is embedded in themes such as the African concept of ubuntu, a life of faith and wisdom, reconciling leadership, or transforming space and community. Ultimately, a Greek term ἀναίδεια (persistence) is connected to the meaning of Ecodomy and ‘life in its fullness’. Several methodologies have been used in the different contributions of the book. Every theological discipline applies a different methodology for the purpose of exposing a specific topic or research theme. In general, the contributions in this book follow a combination of a literature study with the further application of diachronic and synchronic exegetical methods. In addition, single contributions follow an own hermeneutical approach. Not one single contribution, but a combination of different theological disciplines, which form the concepts of brokenness and wholeness (life in its fullness), which expose the polarity of life, are included in this book. In its exposed interdisciplinary interwovenness, the book provides a tapestry of how different theological disciplines are combined into a single theme and how they contribute together by means of theological analyses and attempted building blocks to build the broken ‘houses’ of societal structures or human life. The book contributes to selected aspects of broken life in society and the healing experiences of human life. Several themes touch on recent and relevant challenges which have contributed to the brokenness of life. Not only in South Africa, but globally these are currently relevant themes. They include realities of racism and xenophobia, apartheid, foreignness and exclusivism, leadership crises and violence. With the focus on wholeness, specific attention is given to the African concept of ubuntu, a life of faith and wisdom, reconciling leadership, and transforming space and society. A Greek term ἀναίδεια (insolence as ‘in keeping on asking’ – Lk 11:8) illuminates the theme of Ecodomy from the perspective of a parable. The target audience of the book is academic scholars and theologians, who specialise in the different fields of Theology, the Humanities and other Social Sciences. Furthermore, the book is also accessible to scholars of other academic disciplines outside these disciplines. The book contains original research and contributions have not been plagiarised from publications elsewhere.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Theology at the University of Pretoria - 100 years,Jerry Pilay,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL20930807W,/authors/OL8011863A/Jerry_Pilay,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 363,"In this scholarly book, a century’s theology presented by the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria, is celebrated. All authors are academics or research associates of the University of Pretoria. A historical and futuristic overview with perspectives from the past, present and future, are examined. The past is not only portrayed by means of societal and scientific contributions and achievements, but the authors also reflect on malfunctions, ill behaviour and disappointments of church and theology, presented at the University of Pretoria within the South African context over 100 years. The book commences with a chapter in which institutional transformation is discussed, as well as the changes that demonstrate the role of the Faculty of Theology within a secular state university. It includes an explanation of the importance of research impact, research productivity and research reputation. Among various discipline indicators, the category Theology and Religion Studies plays a significant role in the measurement of world university rankings of universities. With regard to scientific and encyclopaedic content, the book focuses on the theological disciplines presented in the academic curricula: first the biblical sciences (Old and New Testament Studies), then the historical disciplines (Systematic Theology, Church History and Church Polity), and finally the practical disciplines (Practical Theology, Science of Religion and Missiology). The role of Religion Studies in a newly established Faculty of Theology and Religion not only enhances the diversity of interreligious tolerance and an atmosphere of dialogue, but it serves as platform to interconnect with the fields of Humanities, Social and Natural Sciences and other academic disciplines. In the conclusive part of the book, contributions highlight the role of the centres in the Faculty (Centre for Contextual Ministry and Centre for Sustainable Communities), as well as the continental and international footprints of the two theological journals whose title ownership is attached to the Faculty of Theology of the University of Pretoria, namely HTS Theological Studies and Verbum et Ecclesia. The methodology comprised in all the chapters amounts to a literature and contextual study. Since the book describes the histories of formal academic departments, these texts are of a descriptive, interpretative and critical character. Reference is made in some chapters to exegetical methods, like the historical critical methods. The target audience of the book is academic scholars and theologians, who specialise in the different fields of Theology, the Humanities and other Social Sciences. The book is also accessible to scholars of other academic disciplines outside these disciplines. The book comprises original research by several authors and is not plagiarised from other scientific publications of this nature.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Nadenke oor 500 jaar se Reformatoriese teologie,Ignatius (Natie) W.C. Van Wyk,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL20930802W,/authors/OL8011858A/Ignatius_(Natie)_W.C._Van_Wyk,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 255,"In 2017 we celebrate for the 500th time the Reformation of the church. The authors want to ensure that there is also a contribution in Afrikaans in this important year. The central themes of Reformation theology are discussed. Reformation theology did not end with the contributions of Luther and Calvin, and one of the authors therefore, reflects with one of the greatest theologians alive, Jürgen Moltmann, on theology and life. In the recent past, scholars such as Ebeling and Van Selms, made valuable contributions that could be used in present-day discussions on church matters and political challenges. This book is proof that these older contributions are still important for in-depth reflections on complex theological questions. This book is also an exhibition of present-day theological research at the University of Pretoria. A diversity of opinions are tolerated, with the knowledge that there is a common love for our Reformation heritage. The book follows the internationally accepted research methodology in the field of historic theology. The classical texts of the reformers, such as Luther and Calvin, are researched in the original and made accessible to the Afrikaans readership. The book is witness to the fact that we have valuable contributions to Reformation theology coming from the recent past. The contributions are also analysed within their original historic setting and hermeneutically actualised for present-day church matters. This book is an important contribution to the Afrikaans reception of Reformation theology. For the first time, important enunciations of the reformers (especially Luther) are provided in Afrikaans with the original texts in footnotes. For the first time Adrianus Van Selms’ catechetical handbook, that was recently discovered in an archive, is brought into the academic discussion. As South Africans, we struggle with issues such as gender, marriage, the political role of the church and interreligious relationships. It is clear, from this research, that the older European debates are helpful in bringing depth to our contextual debates. The target audience of the book is primarily the academic fraternity in historic theology, systematic theology and science of religion. It is, however, also accessible for ministers of religion and the general public, hence almost all the Latin, German and French quotations are translated into Afrikaans. The main aim was to make an Afrikaans contribution to Reformation 500. I declare that no part of any chapter is taken from another published work without the necessary recognition. This is original research and not one of the chapters has been published somewhere else.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Christelike etiek in 'n sekulariserende samelewing,J.M. Vorster,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL20932527W,/authors/OL8012512A/J.M._Vorster,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  AOSIS|Language Afrikaans,"'Christelike etiek in ?n sekulariserende samelewing' produces authoritative, fully evidenced and well-reasoned treatment of Christian ethics, a major topic that is of central concern to South Africa?s people. It disseminates original research, fosters collaboration of experts and generates new developments within the specific field of Reformed Theology and Christian Ethics.The target audience are specialists in the field of Systematic Theology and contextual ministry. The author applies in Christian ethics the concept of the kingdom of God as the overarching paradigm in order to elucidate societal and ecclesiastical problems which are experienced in morality today. The book?s hypothesis is argued and substantiated by using a very wide variety of classic, as well as recent investigations in the field of ethics. What promotes this specific research is the fact that the author not only refers to international researchers, but also to South African theologians and the South African situation. The book further reflects on the phenomenon secularisation and the notion post-secular spirituality, argued against the background of a universal law of nature and a specific scriptural revelation and Christology. In light of the challenges of postmodernity it focuses on the concepts truth, justice and the prophetic calling of the present-day church. The author has managed to translate Christian situation ethics that enriches and stimulates research thoughts, that can assist and advocate reconciliation in South Africa.

Convinced that Nick is, at best, turning into a religious nut, the self-described agnostic hopes that a quick business trip will give her time to think things through.On board the plane, Mattie strikes up a conversation with a fellow passenger. When she discovers their shared scorn for religion, she confides her frustration over her husband's recent conversion. The stranger suggests that perhaps her husband isn't seeking religion but true spiritual connection, an idea that prompts her to reflect on her own search for fulfillment.As their conversation turns to issues of spiritual longing and deeper questions about the nature of God, Mattie finds herself increasingly drawn to this insightful stranger. But when the discussion unexpectedly turns personal, touching on things she's never told anyone, Mattie is startled and disturbed. Who is this man who seems to peer straight into her soul?From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hinckley, has created a classic look at the values that can change our world--and how to stand up for them. Drawing on anecdotes from his much-admired life of faith and service, as well as examples from American culture today, he examines ten virtues that have always illuminated the path to a better world: love, honesty, morality, civility, learning, forgiveness and mercy, thrift and industry, gratitude, optimism, and faith. He then shows how the two guardians of virtue--marriage and the family--can keep us on that path, even in difficult times. Standing for Something is an inspiring blueprint for what we all can do--as individuals, as a nation, and as a world community--to rediscover the values and virtues that have historically made us strong and that will lead us to a brighter future.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes to: divine answers to life's most difficult problems,Anthony DeStefano,religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL8383250W?edition=ia%3Atenprayersgodalw0000dest_h9o2,/authors/OL2793372A/Anthony_DeStefano,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL18586657M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Walker Large Print|Language English|Pages 297,"There have been thousands of books written about prayer and millions of sermons preached about it, yet people continue to wonder: Why doesn't God answer me when I cry out to him? In light of all the problems we face in life, we want to know why God is often so ""silent"" when we pray to him. Anthony DeStefano, author of the bestselling A Travel Guide to Heaven, knew there had to be an answer to this mystery, so he set out on a quest to find prayers that God says yes to all the time. The result is an extraordinary new book that has the ability to dramatically change the lives of readers of all faiths.Each short, powerful prayer in Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To addresses a particular problem people commonly face in life--from accepting the existence of God to trying to make ends meet; from getting through terrible suffering to coping with everyday stress; from overcoming fear to finding your God-given destiny. Presented with a certainty and vigor that are sure to pique the interest of even those who are not spiritually inclined, these prayers will help readers find solutions to life's most difficult situations and provide meaningful and inspiring answers to the vexing questions we have about the purpose of our time on earth.In a world awash with superficial self-help books and deceptive gimmicks, Ten Prayers God Always Says Yes To is the real thing. Using hundreds of scriptural references to support his claims, DeStefano writes in a simple, straightforward, and uplifting manner that makes the most profound theological matters understandable to all. In the words of the author, ""This is a spiritual treasure chest that is available to everyone....This book is about prayers that work--really, truly work.""

The only authorized biographer who is not a Buddhist, Chhaya conducted more than a dozen personal interviews with the Dalai Lama in McLeod Ganj in India's Himalayan north, home to Tibet's government-in-exile. In Dalai Lama: Man, Monk, Mystic he presents an in-depth, insightful portrait of a figure of perennial interest to people all over the world.Chhaya writes about Tibet and the Buddhist tradition from which the Dalai Lama emerged, helping readers understand the context that shaped his beliefs, politics, and ideals. Adding depth and nuance to his portrait, Chhaya depicts the Dalai Lama in the light of his life in exile and the various roles he has had to assume for his followers. He sheds light on the highly complex conflict between China and Tibet, and offers insights into the growing discontent among young Tibetans who are frustrated with the nonviolent approach to Chinese occupation that the Dalai Lama advocates.A balanced, informative view of the Dalai Lama and his work, this biography is both a compelling profile of a remarkable spiritual leader and his mission, and an engaging look at how the current unrest in his country will affect its future.

Now an updated edition of So You're Thinking About Home Schooling by Lisa Whelchel--herself a homeschooling mother of three--introduces to readers fifteen composite portraits of homeschooling families who show how every family can successfully face the unique challenges of its situation. The story-based approach deals with common questions of time management, teaching weaknesses, and outside responsibilities, as well as children's age variations, social and sports involvement, learning disabilities, and boredom. Seeing a wide variety of homeschooling families in action gives parents the information and confidence they need to make their own decisions about home-based education. Includes a new chapter from Lisa and an all-new resource guide with recommendations from real-life homeschooling families! ""I'm Thinking About Homeschooling"" You're also probably thinking, But can I really teach my children? Where do I start? What if I need to work outside the home? Must I have twelve children, raise goats, and bake my own bread? And what about socialization? I could tell you the answers to these questions, but I would rather show you. Beginning with my own, I want to introduce you to fifteen families in fifteen unique situations who have all chosen to homeschool for different reasons, using a variety of learning methods. So... let's rap lightly on the homeschool door and peek inside before we decide if we are ready to move in! Story Behind the Book""My hope is that by the end of the book, and a stroll through the neighborhood, you will feel more confident as you identify a family situation and teaching method that resonates with your personality and philosophy of education. From there, you can simply look to the end of each chapter to find a sample schedule for the homsechool day and list of curriculum suggestions for that particular teaching method.""--Lisa __""Deciding if homeschooling is right for your family just got easier with this warm, entertaining, information-packed portrayal of its flexibility, diversity, triumphs, and challenges.

The result of wide travel and the author?s own deep curiosity, filled with true tales of the living and dubious legends of the dead, Rag and Bone tells of a California seeker who ended up in a Jerusalem convent because of a nun?s disembodied hand; a French forensics expert who travels on the metro with the rib of a saint; two young brothers who collect tickets at a Syrian mosque, studying English beside a hair from the Prophet Muhammad?s beard; and many other stories, myths, and peculiar histories. With these, and an array of other digits, limbs, and bones, Manseau provides a respectful, witty, informed, inquisitive, thoughtful, and fascinating look into the ""primordial strangeness that is at the heart of belief,"" and the place where the abstractions of faith meet the realities of physical objects, of rags and bones.

Parallel Empires,Massimo Franco,religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL2117912W?edition=ia%3Aparallelempiresv00fran,/authors/OL263309A/Massimo_Franco,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17912591M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Doubleday|Language English,"The fascinating and highly relevant history of the turbulent relationship between the United States and the Holy See, recounted and analyzed by Italian journalist and Vatican insider Massimo FrancoDrawing on unique access to the archives of the Holy See and a range of sources both in Washington, D.C. and Rome, Parallel Empires charts the path of U.S.-Vatican relations to reveal the dramatic religious and political tensions that have shaped their dealings and our world.Starting with the Holy See's initial diplomatic overtures to the United States in the 1780's, Franco illuminates a two-hundred-year-old history of alliances, mutual exploitation, and misperceptions. From the nativist anti-Catholicism of the nineteenth century, through JFK's election as America's first Catholic president and the cold war anti-Communist partnership between the United States and the Holy See, to the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1984, the story has never before been told quite like this. With U.S.-Vatican affairs still evolving in the present day, Parallel Empires also details the most recent developments of this ever-changing and often-tenuous relationship, including contemporary disagreements over the Iraq War and engagement with the Islamic world, and the Papacy of Benedict XVI. Parallel Empires leaves no doubt regarding the impact that the struggle between these two great powers--one of secular might and the other of moral influence--has had on both our history and on today's world. Franco's insights are sure to have lasting relevance as U.S.-Vatican relations continue to evolve, and with religion's undeniable influence on everything from domestic elections to international terrorism, his work will prove invaluable in coming years.

Written over a period of three decades and accessible to the non-specialist, these essays provide a wealth of information and insights on the Shang dynasty, traditionally dated 1766-1122 or 1056 BCE. Of all the eras of Chinese history, the Shang has been a particularly elusive one, long considered more myth than reality. A historian with a keen appreciation for anthropology and archaeology, the author has given us many descriptions of Shang life. Best known for his analysis of oracle bones, he has looked beyond the bones themselves and expanded his historical vision to ponder the lives of those who used them. What did the Shang diviner think he was doing? The temerity to ask such questions and the insights they have provided have been provocative and, at times, controversial. Equally intriguing have been the author's assertions that many of the distinctive features of Chinese civilization were already in evidence during the Shang, 3000 years ago. -- From publisher's website.

Yet some Gnostic beliefs derive from the older Mystery traditions of Greece and Rome, and the various Gnostic schools came to be branded as heretical by the emerging Christian church. Indeed, although some Gnostic beliefs are close to mainstream Christianity Gnosticism also held that the world is imperfect as it was created by an evil god who was constantly at war with the true, good God; that Christ and Satan were brothers; that reincarnation exists; and that women were the equal of men As a result, the Gnostics held the Feminine Aspect of God - whom they addressed as Sophia, or Wisdom - in very high regard. They also stressed that we each have a spark of the Divine inside us which, when recognised and developed, will ultimately liberate us from the prison of the material world. Although largely stamped out by the Church by the sixth century, Gnosticism survived underground through groups such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, and influenced the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the psychologist Carl Jung, the Existentialists, the New Age movement and writers as diverse as William Blake, W.B. Yeats, Albert Camus and Philip K. Dick. In this book, Sean Martin recounts the long and diverse history of Gnosticism, and argues for its continued relevance today.

The small community of the Karaite Jews, a non-Talmudic Turkic-speaking minority, who had been living in Eastern Europe since the late Middle Ages, developed a unique ethnographic culture and religious tradition. The book offers the first comprehensive study of the Galician Karaite community from its earliest days until today with the main emphasis placed on the period from 1772 until 1945. Especially important is the analysis of the twentieth-century dejudaization (or Turkicization) of the community, which saved the Karaites from the horrors of the Holocaust.

While previous scholarly approaches have minimised the diversity of cultic practices and traditions found in Nabataea, this study reveals a vibrant religious landscape dominated by a variety of local traditions""--Back cover.

For them, fundamentalism is not just a set of religious beliefs. It is rather a set of beliefs about and attitudes toward whatever religious beliefs one has. In this analysis, the authors show that fundamentalist beliefs and attitudes vary across national contexts and individual characteristics, and predict people's orientation toward the same set of historical issues that were the concerns of fundamentalist intellectual leaders and activists. The authors' analysis reveals a ""cycle of spirituality"" that reinforces the critical importance of taking historical and cultural contexts into consideration to understand the role of religious fundamentalism in contemporary Middle Eastern societies""--Page 4 of cover.

The religion of Socrates,Mark L. McPherran,religion,First published in 1996,/works/OL2973179W?edition=ia%3Areligionofsocrat0000mcph,/authors/OL454685A/Mark_L._McPherran,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9722157M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 1, 1999|Publisher  Pennsylvania State University Press,              Eurospan|Language English|Pages 366","This study argues that to understand Socrates we must uncover and analyze his religious views, since his philosophical and religious views are part of one seamless whole. Mark McPherran provides a close analysis of the relevant Socratic texts, an analysis that yields a comprehensive and original account of Socrates' commitments to religion (e.g., the nature of the gods, the immortality of the soul).  McPherran finds that Socrates was not only a rational philosopher of the first rank, but a figure with a profoundly religious nature as well, believing in the existence of gods vastly superior to ourselves in power and wisdom and sharing other traditional religious commitments with his contemporaries. However, Socrates was just as much a sensitive critic and rational reformer of both the religious tradition he inherited and the new cultic incursions he encountered. McPherran contends that Socrates saw his religious commitments as integral to his philosophical mission of moral examination and, in turn, used the rationally derived convictions underlying that mission to reshape the religious conventions of his time. As a result, Socrates made important contributions to the rational reformation of Greek religion, contributions that incited and informed the theology of his brilliant pupil, Plato.

Norton|Language English,"This book is a sweeping, five-decade history of the evangelical movement in southern California that explains an epochal realignment of American politics. From Bible Belt to Sun Belt tells the dramatic and largely unknown story of ""plain-folk"" religious migrants: hardworking men and women from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas who fled the Depression and came to California for military jobs during World War II. Investigating this fiercely pious community at a grassroots level, Darren Dochuk uses the stories of religious leaders, including Billy Graham, as well as many colorful, lesser-known figures to explain how evangelicals organized a powerful political machine. This machine made its mark with Barry Goldwater, inspired Richard Nixon's ""Southern Solution,"" and achieved its greatest triumph with the victories of Ronald Reagan. Based on entirely new research, the manuscript has already won the prestigious Allan Nevins Prize from the Society of American Historians. The judges wrote, ""Dochuk offers a rich and multidimensional perspective on the origins of one of the most far-ranging developments of the second half of the twentieth century: the rise of the New Right and modern conservatism."" - Publisher.

Forbidden Memories,Jennifer Lindsay,religion,First published in 2015,/works/OL20928460W,/authors/OL5805842A/Jennifer_Lindsay,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Monash University Publishing|Language English,"This is the first book to consider the experiences of women survivors of the 1965 anti-communist violence in the majority Christian region of Eastern Indonesia. So far, most studies of the 1965 violence have focused on the Muslim majority population of Java and the Hindu majority population of Bali. Forbidden Memories presents stories from across the regions of Sumba, Sabu, Alor, Kupang and other parts of West Timor of women who were imprisoned and tortured or whose husbands were murdered. The book comprises a critical examination of the role of the Protestant Church at the time of the violence and, in its aftermath, the ongoing sanctions and political purges against those considered to be supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party. The writers argue that religious and state institutions failed to care for this vulnerable community in the face of state terrorism and a culture of fear.

Pandora's Jar,Natalie Haynes,religion,First published in 2022,/works/OL24326622W,/authors/OL6942351A/Natalie_Haynes,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32195863M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  HarperCollins Publishers|Language English,"The tellers of Greek myths--historically men--have routinely sidelined the female characters. When they do take a larger role, women are often portrayed as monstrous, vengeful or just plain evil--like Pandora, the woman of eternal scorn and damnation whose curiosity is tasked with causing all the world's suffering and wickedness when she opened that forbidden box. But, as Natalie Haynes reveals, in ancient Greek myths there was no box. It was a jar . . . which is far more likely to tip over.  In Pandora's Jar, the broadcaster, writer, stand-up comedian, and passionate classicist turns the tables, putting the women of the Greek myths on an equal footing with the men. With wit, humor, and savvy, Haynes revolutionizes our understanding of epic poems, stories, and plays, resurrecting them from a woman's perspective and tracing the origins of their mythic female characters. She looks at women such as Jocasta, Oedipus' mother-turned-lover-and-wife (turned Freudian sticking point), at once the cleverest person in the story and yet often unnoticed. She considers Helen of Troy, whose marriage to Paris ""caused"" the Trojan war--a somewhat uneven response to her decision to leave her husband for another man. She demonstrates how the vilified Medea was like an ancient Beyonce--getting her revenge on the man who hurt and betrayed her, if by extreme measures. And she turns her eye to Medusa, the original monstered woman, whose stare turned men to stone, but who wasn't always a monster, and had her hair turned to snakes as punishment for being raped.  Pandora's Jar brings nuance and care to the millennia-old myths and legends and asks the question: Why are we so quick to villainize these women in the first place--and so eager to accept the stories we've been told?

Using a wide variety of literary, historical and archaeological evidence, she argues that the first perceptions of Arabs, Ismaelites and Saracens which derived from Christian exegesis preconditioned western expressions of hostility and superiority towards peoples of the Islamic world, and that these received ideas prevailed even as material contacts increased between England and Muslim territory. Medieval texts invariably represented Muslim Arabs as Saracens and Ismaelites (or Hagarenes), described by Jerome as biblical enemies of the Christian world three centuries before Muhammad's lifetime. Two early ideas in particular - that Saracens worshipped Venus and dissembled their own identity - continued into the early modern period. This finding has interesting implications for earlier theses by Edward Said and Norman Daniel concerning the history of English perceptions of Islam.

Luck is your silent companion, sometimes bringing awesome parking spaces, a chance meeting with a new love interest, or a small windfall. Most of the time you probably don't even pay attention to luck. Chances are, you only really think about luck when you buy a lottery ticket or participate in a contest.Luck is so much more than that. If you take steps to live longer by eating right and exercising, why wouldn't you also take similar steps to improve your good fortune? Barrie Dolnick and Anthony Davidson asked themselves this very question, and set out to study luck and decipher how it works. In this insightful and engaging book, they share the secrets they've uncovered so you can use luck more effectively in your day-to-day life. Where does luck originate? Does one need to be ""born lucky"" in order to be lucky? Answering these and many other pressing questions, Dolnick and Davidson investigate both ancient and scientific approaches to luck. From early man to famous rationalists, luck has been prayed for, played with, and courted. You'll learn how ancient practices such as the I Ching, astrology, tarot, and numerology have been used to understand luck, and how great mathematicians studied luck--some guided by their own interest in gambling. Every- one wants to be lucky. Once you know the fundamentals of luck, the authors take you through your own Personal Luck Profile so that you can use this wisdom and try your luck. People do a lot of weird things to improve their luck--and now you can make smart choices and informed decisions about how to play with yours.From the Hardcover edition.

His escape had been mad enough. He had simply walked out. This very afternoon, Thursday October 13th, 1659, he had walked out of the Gatehouse prison at Westminster, where he had been awaiting trial as a rebel taken in arms against the Commomwealth of England. The turnkey, bringing his dinner, had been hardly in the cell with it when such a shouting had broken out in the yard below that the man had gone running, forgetting his keys: and Harry Burnaby, who could at least take a chance when he had it, had quietly followed him down. In the yard the turnkeys had all been jostling round the gate, where a man on horseback was bawling out what seemed to be some tale of news and not a head had turned at Harry Burnaby, still taking his chance, slipped quietly round the yard and out of the wicket gate. Since then he had been making his way to London, past Whitehall and the Charing Cross, along the Strand and the noisy bustle of Fleet Street, and now he was in the City proper, through the Ludgate and looking up the hill. Somewhere in front of him, if he could have seen it in the dark must be the great loom of the cathedral, but he was not concerned with that. Before him, not twenty yards away a bonfire was flaring and crackling in the street, tended by a clutter of apprentices and he wondered why;something, perhaps, to do with the tale the man had shouted to the turnkeys. But what was more immediate was a patrol of soldiers, half a dozen men and a corporal, standing back against the houses at one side of the fire and at the sight of them he moved quickly to the other side.He was in the wrong clothes for londopn, and he could take anybody's eye.......(taken from cover notes)   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hobson offers an in-depth study of prophetic traditions in African American religion. He shows how African American prophets shared a belief in a ""God of the oppressed:"" a God who tested the nation's ability to move toward justice and who showed favor toward struggles for equality. Hobson also provides insight into the conflict between the African American prophets who believed that the nation could one day be redeemed through struggle, and those who felt that its hypocrisy and malevolence lay too deep for redemption. Contrary to the prevalent view that black nationalism is the strongest African American justice tradition, Hobson argues that the reformative tradition in prophecy has been most important and constant in the struggle for equality, and has sparked a politics of prophetic integrationism spanning most of two centuries. Hobson shows too the special role of millennial teaching in sustaining hope for oppressed people and cross-fertilizing other prophecy traditions. The Mount of Vision concludes with an examination of the meaning of African American prohecy today, in the time of the first African American presidency, the semicentenary of the civil rights movement, and the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War: paradoxical moments in which our ""post-racial"" society is still pervaded by injustice, and prophecy is not fulfilled but endures as a challenge.

Isn't it unrealistic, given that he is infinitely pure and we are clearly imperfect? Such a standard seems either to ignore our frailty or to impose certain failure--until we understand how God views us. Then we are reminded that, thanks to what Christ accomplished on our behalf, our perfection is not the requirement for entering his kingdom. Yet that very grace still calls us to live righteously--for the sake of our well-being, yes, but most of all, because it glorifies God. In this challenging yet heartwarming work, Bryan Chapell illustrates the principles of grace, the practices of faith, and the motives of love in living a life of holiness. You will journey through reassuring Scripture passages that show good works and obedience to be, not a means of establishing or maintaining salvation, but a grateful response to God's mercy. And in Bryan Chapell's encouraging words--drawn straight from the heart of God--you will understand that your holiness is not so much a matter of what you achieve as it is the grace that God provides. A grace so rich as to make the pursuit of his holiness your soul's deepest delight. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
The Crisis of Religious Liberty,Stephen M.

Such challenges include the mandate from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services concerning contraceptive, sterilization, and abortifacient coverage in health insurance plans; the question of health-care institutions requiring medical personnel to participate in morally objectionable procedures contrary to their religious beliefs; legal liability for individuals and businesses refusing on religious grounds to provide services for same-sex marriages; the prohibition on students from engaging in religious expression in public schools; the use of zoning laws to block Bible studies in private homes; and a variety of other issues that have surfaced in recent years with respect to religious freedom. While some argues that religious liberty extends no further than the freedom to worship, contributors suggest otherwise, noting that the exercise of religious liberty is greater than a highly restrictive definition of the notion of worship.  The Crisis of Religious Liberty comprises eight chapters and an afterword that explore the nature and basis of religious freedom in terms of Catholic social thought. They cover such topics as the Catholic Church's teachings from the Vatican II's Dignatis Humanae (Declaration on Religious Liberty), the decline of a historic rapprochement among different religious perspectives in the United States in the face of an increasingly aggressive secularism, perspectives on religious liberty from the founding of America, and how the religious liberty situation in the U.S. compares with the rest of the world.  The Crisis of Religious Liberty:Reflections from Law, History, and Catholic Social Thought should appeal to a variety of professionals as well as a scholars: lawyers and clergy, health care professionals and Catholic business owners, and researchers in the fields of religion, law, American politics, and sociology.

As a bright, young girl from Ohio, Andrea Raynor was fascinated by religion. Then she landed--almost by accident--at Harvard Divinity School, which, she quickly discovered, was no typical seminary. When she attended in the 1980s, HDS was a place overflowing with creative expression and freedom of thought. Her classmates included two men who were undergoing sex changes and another who fancied herself a geisha. There was a lively gay and lesbian caucus, marches on Washington, civil disobedience, and more sexual intrigue than a stereotypical college fraternity house.  Providing a birds-eye view of life within the hallowed halls (and beneath the crimson robes), Incognito is a humorous and poignant glimpse inside one of the nation's most revered institutions. It begins with the long drive from Ohio to Cambridge, and ends at the bedside of a young, dying woman, but the real story is about the challenges, surprises, and ultimately life-changing experiences Andrea faced on the road to becoming a minister. From whether a pretty girl can truly wear a collar to how so many people can believe so many different things, Incognito tackles our assumptions about spirituality, the church, morality, and identity, and ultimately affirms that God often works in ways--and in people--we least expect""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It shows how spirituality has in fact become a powerful commodity in the global marketplace - a cultural addiction that reflects orthodox politics, curbs self-expression and colonizes Eastern beliefs.Exposing how spirituality has today come to embody the privatization of religion in the modern West, Jeremy Carrette and Richard King reveal the people and brands who profit from this corporate hijack, and explore how spirituality can be reclaimed as a means of resistance to capitalism and its deceptions.

With simple, down-to-earth language, Rolheiser illustrates the importance of prayer and offers techniques on how to pray, using examples from daily life, Scripture, and contemporary writers. He delves into the places that we fear to go with our issues about prayer, encouraging us with gentle kindness and words of hope and inspiration. The book is divided into five sections. 1. Why Pray? Illustrates the purposes and benefits of prayer for ourselves, as well as for the broader Catholic community and even the world. 2. Why Is It so Hard? Notes how our contemporary culture conspires against taking time out for solitude and prayer, and how our own ego--with its fears, restlessness, and narcissism--can work against developing a deeper relationship with God through prayer. 3. What Is Prayer? Outlines the two basic types of prayer, that is, affective (personal) and priestly (for the world). This section also notes the many ways or methods for each type of prayer, such as meditation, contemplation, the divine office, the Mass, and Scripture. 4. Sticking with It When It Gets Hard. This section covers the development of mature prayer, discussing ways to pray in times of boredom, disillusionment, crisis, helplessness, or after a loved one's death. 5. Mysticism. Here we learn about this increasingly popular form of intimate relationship with God. There will be a leader's guide for this book, making it an ideal resource for use with prayer groups, small faith communities, and retreats. This is a book for all manner of believer, whether your faith is solidly rooted in Catholicism, wavering between the Christianity of childhood and non-participatory faith as an adult, or just not sure what you believe--or whether you believe at all. It addresses topics that typify our culture, such as narcissism, pragmatism, efficiency, and self-gratification, and that work against a healthy spiritual life. Finally, the book takes us to a place of contact and comfort, in relationship not only with God but with our true selves as well""--  ""Prayer: Our Deepest Longing looks at the issues facing people of faith in today's culture, and offers a way of more effectively dealing with them by seeking out opportunities for prayer.

If so, is the concept of God logical and in agreement with the knowledge of the world that science has provided to date? The God presented by most religions doesn’t make sense in today’s world; we have little room for miracles. Furthermore, there are irreconcilable aspects in the world’s religions. Must we abandon our faith or belief in God? Perhaps not, says popular Swedish thinker Stefan Einhorn. We can behave as scientists do when they run experiments only to obtain contradictory results. They ask themselves whether there might not be a logical conclusion that binds all the results together and leads to the most probable explanation. Einhorn hypothesizes that if God truly exists, then many different religions would have discovered this. He finds a common denominator in the concept of a hidden God in seven major religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. But even with this shared belief, can we know if God exists? Did humankind create the idea of God to answer the unexplainable? What about evil and suffering, the absence of meaning in life, loneliness and insecurity? And most importantly, how do we search for a concealed God?Most religions share common principles for the search for “that which is concealed,” including meditation, contemplation, and prayer. Whatever route is chosen, the search for God may bring us some answers. Einhorn concludes that two themes are central to the search: one is that God is both concealed and simultaneously omnipresent; the other is that only with utter humility and an awareness of our inability to fully understand may we approach the divine.In the end, there are no definite answers. But the search sheds light on the many paths to enlightenment offered by the world’s religions.

Killed in mysterious circumstances in 1989 in Peshawar, Pakistan, he remains one of the most influential jihadi ideologues of all time. Here, in the first in-depth biography of Azzam, Thomas Hegghammer explains how Azzam came to play this role and why jihadism went global at this particular time. It traces Azzam's extraordinary life journey from a West Bank village to the battlefields of Afghanistan, telling the story of a man who knew all the leading Islamists of his time and frequented presidents, CIA agents, and Cat Stevens the pop star. It is, however, also a story of displacement, exclusion, and repression that suggests that jihadism went global for fundamentally local reasons.         Tells the entertaining story of Azzam's extremely eventful life, culminating in his extremely mysterious death        Explains why the jihadi movement went international in the 1980s, improving our understanding about this ideology and the people behind it        Revises early history of al-Qaida through the use of previously untapped primary sources    —Publisher   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pickleball Faith is a personal journey of faith as the author shares experiences in becoming part of a pickleball community. Written as a personal journey and reading like a journal, the author shares her thoughts about others and how God changes her through the process of being in relationships through pickleball.  Using the author's background as a therapist, insights in the book address not only interpersonal relationships with others, but also a personal relationship with God. It's a journey of belonging and also becoming. Compassionate, raw, and real the author dives into issues of conflict, death, sportsmanship, and faith. You will be inspired to consider not only whom you're playing with, but more importantly whom you are becoming personally and in relationship with God.
