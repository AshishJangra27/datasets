Aga Akbar, a deaf-mute boy from the mountain, develops his own private script from these symbols and writes passionately of his life, his family and his efforts to make sense of the changes the twentieth century brings to his country. Exiled in Holland a generation later, Akbar's son Ishmael struggles to decipher the notebook, reflecting how his own political activities have forced him to flee his country and abandon his family. As he gets closer to the heart of his father's story, he unravels the intricate tale of how the silent world of a village carpet-mender was forced to give way to one where the increasingly hostile environment of modern Iran has brought the family both love and sacrifice.

In examining how four artists and writers represented fascist leaders, Annalisa Zox-Weaver aims to achieve a more complex understanding of the modernist political imagination. She examines how photographer Lee Miller, filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, writer Gertrude Stein and journalist Janet Flanner interpret, dramatize and exploit Hitler, Göring and Pétain. Within their own artistic medium, each of these modernists explore confrontations between private and public identity, and historical narrative and the construction of myth. This study makes use of extensive archival material, such as letters, photographs, journals, unpublished manuscripts and ephemera and includes ten illustrations. This interdisciplinary perspective opens up wider discussions of the relationship between artists and dictators, modernism and fascism, and authority and representation""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Two of the most admired of these — ""Bartleby"" and ""Benito Cereno"" — first appeared as magazine pieces and were then published in 1856 as part of a collection of short stories entitled The Piazza Tales.  ""Bartleby"" (also known as ""Bartleby the Scrivener"") is an intriguing moral allegory set in the business world of mid-19th-century New York. A strange, enigmatic man employed as a clerk in a legal office, Bartleby forces his employer to come to grips with the most basic questions of human responsibility, and haunts the latter's conscience, even after Bartleby's dismissal.  ""Benito Cereno,"" considered one of Melville's best short stories, deals with a bloody slave revolt on a Spanish vessel. A splendid parable of man's struggle against the forces of evil, the carefully developed and mysteriously guarded plot builds to a dramatic climax while revealing the horror and depravity of which man is capable.  Reprinted here from standard texts in a finely made, yet inexpensive new edition, these stories offer the general reader and students of Melville and American literature sterling examples of a literary giant at his story-telling best.    --back cover   Read more Read less",12 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Using a playful parallel-universe structure, The Post-Birthday World follows one woman's future as it unfolds under the influence of two drastically different men.  Children's book illustrator Irina McGovern enjoys a quiet and settled life in London with her partner, fellow American expatriate Lawrence Trainer, a smart, loyal, disciplined intellectual at a prestigious think tank. To their small circle of friends, their relationship is rock solid. Until the night Irina unaccountably finds herself dying to kiss another man: their old friend from South London, the stylish, extravagant, passionate top-ranking snooker player Ramsey Acton. The decision to give in to temptation will have consequences for her career, her relationships with family and friends, and perhaps most importantly the texture of her daily life.  Hinging on a single kiss, this enchanting work of fiction depicts Irina's alternating futures with two men temperamentally worlds apart yet equally honorable. With which true love Irina is better off is neither obvious nor easy to determine, but Shriver's exploration of the two destinies is memorable and gripping. Poignant and deeply honest, written with the subtlety and wit that are the hallmarks of Shriver's work, The Post-Birthday World appeals to the what-if in us all.

The book she was writing about Isaac Newton's involvement with alchemy--the culmination of her lifelong obsession with the seventeenth century--remains unfinished. When her son, Cameron, asks his former lover, Lydia Brooke, to ghostwrite the missing final chapters of his mother's book, Lydia agrees and moves into Elizabeth's house--a studio in an orchard where the light moves restlessly across the walls. Soon Lydia discovers that the shadow of violence that has fallen across present-day Cambridge, which escalates to a series of murders, may have its origins in the troubling evidence that Elizabeth's research has unearthed. As Lydia becomes ensnared in a dangerous conspiracy that reawakens ghosts of the past, the seventeenth century slowly seeps into the twenty-first, with the city of Cambridge the bridge between them.Filled with evocative descriptions of Cambridge, past and present, Ghostwalk centers around a real historical mystery that Rebecca Stott has uncovered involving Newton's alchemy. In it, time and relationships are entangled--the present with the seventeenth century, and figures from the past with the love-torn twenty-first-century woman who is trying to discover their secrets.A stunningly original display of scholarship and imagination, and a gripping story of desire and obsession, Ghostwalk is a rare debut that will change the way most of us think about scientific innovation, the force of history, and time itself.From the Hardcover edition.

While the novels themselves are as varied as their authors, this work aims at introducing readers to some common literary strategies and theological agendas found in this rewriting phenomenon by surveying a few prominent examples. It also explores the question of what happens when we examine the intertextual play between these Gospel rewrites and their Gospel progenitors as we allow these contemporary novels to pose new questions to their ancient counterparts. An intriguing hermeneutical circle ensues as we embark on our quest for the fictional Jesus and accompany his incarnations as they lead us back to reexamine the canonical portraits of Jesus anew.

Over the past five years, she has spent periods of silence in the Sinai desert, the Australian bush, and the Isle of Skye. She interweaves these experiences with the history of silence through fairy-tale and myth, Western and Eastern religious traditions, the Enlightenment and psychoanalysis, up to the ambivalence towards silence in contemporary society. Maitland has built a hermitage on an isolated Scottish moor, and the book culminates powerfully with her experiences of silence in this new home.

Left behind as a teenager when his own parents emigrated to New Zealand, he has few pointers - and the time he spent with Sophie's mother has left him afraid of the power their child may unleash as she develops... Sammy Agnew put his violent and bloody past behind him when he and his wife had children; the eldest, Mark, still lives a nocturnal existence in the attic upstairs. But Sammy fears that his son may have inherited the anger that he himself, at times, can barely suppress... As matters fall into frenzy with the city in flames - and as the lines between fantasy and truth, right and wrong, begin to blur - who will these two fathers choose to protect?

J. DeGaris,"From the book:I came upon the place quite unexpectedly. Centuries of wind and wave had carved a little nook out of the foot of the cliff and fashioned it so cunningly that I did not see it until I was right on top of it. After the warmth of the open beach and the glare of the white road I had recently travelled its shade looked so inviting that I limped in under the overhang of the cliff and dropped joyfully on to the cool patch of sand. It was the first moment of contentment I had known for many weary months, and, needless to say, I set myself out to make the most of it. I was absolutely sick of tramping about. My left boot had burst and, by the feel of it, there wasn't too much left of my right sole. I had been crawling along the road since daylight - and for many days before for that matter - searching for a job that failed to materialise.     Jobs, it appeared, were just about as scarce as cool spots in Hades. They had been very kind to me at the last farmhouse. The good lady had given me an excellent breakfast and an extra glass of milk, had loaded my bedraggled pockets with food and had finally put me on the road to the sea. Work, she said, they could not give me. They had put off two men the previous day.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dutton|Language English|Pages 221,"In Caliban in Grub Street, the redoubtable Msgr Knox turns his attention to the religious opinions of the common Englishman of 1930, through a series of articles and essays published in the popular press, including works by such luminaries as Arthur Conan Doyle, Bertrand Russell, Hugh Walpole, and Rebecca West.  What he discovers is that most of them reject religion, but they do not do so because their reason demands it, but rather because they reject reason, or at least they deny that reason can be applied to matters of the spirit.  For Knox, this accounts for the modern preference for spiritualism over religion - spirituality being to religion what sentimentality is to emotion - and the fuzziness of thought found even among those who outwardly profess religion.  Needless to say, Knox is emphatically not among those who reject either reason or religion, and it is a pleasure to follow him as he examines these journalistic efforts, uncovering their hidden inconsistencies, craven ambiguities, and patent nonsense.  For Knox's God is not only reasonable, but the source and ground of reason, and therefore also no lagniappe to a satisfying life, but the condition of all human fulfillment.

Socrates is represented in the character which he attributes to himself in the Apology of a know-nothing who detects the conceit of knowledge in others. The two have met already in the Protagoras and in the Symposium; in the latter dialogue, as in this, the relation between them is that of a lover and his beloved. But the narrative of their loves is told differently in different places; for in the Symposium Alcibiades is depicted as the impassioned but rejected lover; here, as coldly receiving the advances of Socrates, who, for the best of purposes, lies in wait for the aspiring and ambitious youth.  Alcibiades, who is described as a very young man, is about to enter on public life, having an inordinate opinion of himself, and an extravagant ambition. Socrates, 'who knows what is in man,' astonishes him by a revelation of his designs   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It was well-deserved: he composed (at the end the 3rd c. A.D.) fifteen discourses against the Christians, so offensive that Christian emperors ordered them to be burnt. We thus rely on the testimonies of three prominent Christian writers to know what Porphyry wrote. Scholars have long thought that we could rely on those testimonies to know Porphyry's ideas. Exploring early religious debates which still resonate today, 'Porphyry in Fragments' argues instead that Porphyry's actual thoughts became mixed with the thoughts of the Christians who preserved his ideas, as well as those of other Christian opponents.

In JESUS FOR THE NONRELIGIOUS, he takes aim at the church’s core belief: who is Jesus. He first strips the superstitious barnacles that have attached themselves to this incredible person: such as that Jesus was born of a virgin in Bethlehem, that his father was Joseph, that he did miracles, that he had twelve disciples, and especially that he physically rose from the dead. Next Spong explains how these traditions arose by the early disciples seeing all he did through the lens of the Hebrew Scriptures. With these new revelations, we are then able to see the true Jesus, a heroic figure who revealed divinity through his humanness and can still guide us today. In short, Spong breaks Jesus free from the idol religion has created and restores for us a revolutionary and life-giving figure we all need to meet.

Immediately snatched up by ominous figures in hazmat suits, interrogated searately in neutral Ikea-like chambers, and then released as 15-minute-celebrities into a world driven almost entirely by the internet, these five unforgettable people endure a barrage of unusual and highly 21st-century circumstances. A charismatic scientist with dubious motives eventually brings the quintet together, and their shared experience unites them in a way they could never have imagined.Generation A mirrors the structure of 1991's Generation X as it champions the act of reading and storytelling as one of the few defences we still have against the constant bombardment of the senses in a digital world. Like much of Coupland's writing, it occupies the perplexing hinterland between optimism about the future and everyday, apocalyptic paranoia, and is his most ambitious and entertaining novel to date.

The modernist novel,Stephen Kern,literature,First published in 2011,/works/OL16149057W,/authors/OL457417A/Stephen_Kern,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 253,"""Leading scholar Stephen Kern offers a probing analysis of the modernist novel, encompassing American, British and European works. Organized thematically, the book offers a comprehensive analysis of the stunningly original formal innovations in novels by Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Proust, Gide, Faulkner, Dos Passos, Kafka, Musil and others. Kern contextualizes and explains how formal innovations captured the dynamic history of the period, reconstructed as ten master narratives. He also draws briefly on poetry and painting of the first half of the twentieth century. The Modernist Novel is set to become a fundamental source for discussions of the genre and a useful introduction to the subject for students and scholars of modernism and twentieth-century literature""--  ""The period 1900-1940 produced revolutionary developments in science and the arts. The rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's laws of heredity in 1900 undercut the popular notion that the values and character traits of parents blend in offspring and are transmitted directly to them. In The Interpretation of Dreams of 1900 Sigmund Freud laid the foundation for his theory of the mind as a network of unconscious processes and the residue of childhood psychosexual experience. Also in 1900, the introduction of Planck's constant to explain the spectra of radiating bodies was the first blow to classical physics, leading to a major elaboration of quantum theory by 1927. Most unsettling was the theory's indeterminacy principle, which put knowledge of subatomic events on a probabilistic basis, thereby limiting the sort of deterministic causal knowledge that classical physics had posited throughout the universe. Albert Einstein's special relativity theory of 1905 maintained that space and time are not absolute and distinct but transform into one another. In 1908 Arnold Schoenberg composed music in no single tonal system, while in 1911 Wassily Kandinsky painted no recognizable objects. No single literary change was as revolutionary as these others. However, the sum of formal innovations in the novel was revolutionary in providing new ways of rendering how people experience personal development, courtship conventions, family relations, urban life, national identification, imperial conquest, capitalist enterprise, liberal institutions, religious faith, and artistic creativity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Modernism and Race examines relationships between racial typologies and literature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, drawing on fin de sie;cle versions of anthropology, sociology, political science, linguistics and biology. Collectively, these essays interrogate the anxieties and desires that are expressed in, or projected onto, racialized figures. They include new outlines of how the critical field has developed, revaluations of canonical modernist figures like James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Ford Madox Ford and Wyndham Lewis, and accounts of writers often positioned at the margins of modernism, such as Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay and the Holocaust writers Solomon Perel and Gisella Perl. This timely collection by leading scholars of modernism will make an important contribution to a growing field""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At a barbecue in a Melbourne suburb, a man loses his temper and slaps the child of the host’s friends. This incident unleashes a slew of divisive opinions, pitting friends and families against each other as the child’s parents take the man to court. Told from eight different viewpoints, the novel also deftly fills in disparate backstories encompassing young and old, single and married, gay and straight, as well as depicting how multiculturalism is increasingly impacting the traditional Aussie ethos. For good measure, the author also throws in male vanity, infidelity, and homophobia. Tsiolkas’ in-your-face style is sure to alienate some readers—the child’s parents, for example, are among the book’s most unlikable characters—but his novel, which won the 2009 Commonwealth Prize, fairly radiates with vitality as it depicts the messy complications of family life."" -- Joanne Wilkinson, Booklist   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Stibbe introduces a wide readership to a number of literary approaches to the fourth gospel. He examines the character of Jesus using reader response criticism, the plot using structuralist literary criticism and the genre using archetypal criticism. The structure is analysed using the methodology of deconstructionism. Stibbe interprets the polemic against the Jews by drawing on the ethics of reception.In addition, John's Gospel includes a detailed introduction which puts readers in touch with recent research, and a conclusion which points forward to future areas of development. There is also a comprehensive bibliography.This book will appeal to all theologians, students of Divinity and ministers of religion, as well as to all those who are interested in the Bible as literature.

In Sera Dubash's home, Bhima scrubs the floors of a house in which she remains an outsider. She cleans furniture she is not permitted to sit on. She washes glasses from which she is not allowed to drink. Yet despite being separated from each other by blood and class, she and Sera find themselves bound by gender and shared life experiences.Sera is an upper-middle-class Parsi housewife whose opulent surroundings hide the shame and disappointment of her abusive marriage. A widow, she devotes herself to her family, spending much of her time caring for her pregnant daughter, Dinaz, a kindhearted, educated professional, and her charming and successful son-in-law, Viraf.Bhima, a stoic illiterate hardened by a life of despair and loss, has worked in the Dubash household for more than twenty years. Cursed by fate, she sacrifices all for her beautiful, headstrong granddaughter, Maya, a university student whose education —paid for by Sera —will enable them to escape the slums. But when an unwed Maya becomes pregnant by a man whose identity she refuses to reveal, Bhima's dreams of a better life for her granddaughter, as well as for herself, may be shattered forever.Poignant and compelling, evocative and unforgettable, The Space Between Us is an intimate portrait of a distant yet familiar world. Set in modern-day India and witnessed through two compelling and achingly real women, the novel shows how the lives of the rich and the poor are intrinsically connected yet vastly removed from each other, and vividly captures how the bonds of womanhood are pitted against the divisions of class and culture.

Rumored to be a black-hearted gold digger with designs on the doctor's name andfortune, Emma is immediately put under house arrest during a murder investigation. A swift conviction is sure to catapult flamboyant district attorney Abraham Oakey Hall into the mayor's seat. But one formidable obstacle stands in his way: the defense attorney Henry Clinton. Committed to justice and the law, Clinton will aid the vulnerable widow in her desperate fight to save herself from the gallows.Set in 1857 New York, this gripping mystery is also a richly detailed excavation of a lost age. Horan vividly re-creates a tumultuous era characterized by a sensationalist press, aggressive new wealth, a booming real-estate market, corruption, racial conflict, economic inequality between men and women, and the erosion of the old codes of behavior. A tale of murder, sex, greed, and politics, this spellbinding narrative transports readers to a time that eerily echoes our own.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After Balzac made such issues significant in canonical literature, the Goncourt brothers, Huysmans, MallarmE and Maupassant celebrated their golden age. Flaubert and Zola scorned them. Rachilde and Lorrain perverted them. Proust commemorated their last moments of glory. Focusing on the bibelot (the modern French term for knick-knack, curiosity or other collectible), Janell Watson shows how the sudden prominence given to curiosities and collecting in nineteenth-century literature signals a massive change in attitudes to the world of goods, which in turn restructured the literary text according to the practical logic of daily life, calling into question established scholarly notions of order. Her study makes an important contribution to the literary history of material culture.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Frances Burney and Narrative Prior to Ideology,Brian McCrea,literature,First published in 2013,/works/OL16815510W,/authors/OL392251A/Brian_McCrea,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25441682M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  University of Delaware Press,"Frances Burney and Narrative Prior to Ideology works between Burney’s Journals and Letters and her fiction more thoroughly than any study of her in the past twenty-five years. By doing so, it offers significant reinterpretations of Burney’s four novels: Evelina, Cecilia, Camilla, and The Wanderer. It describes Burney’s eluding the major modern–isms through which critics have tried to read her: Feminism (with its “gendering” of beauty and reversal of gender roles); Capitalism and its Marxist critique (here the details of Burney’s housekeeping become important); Professionalism (as a response to status inconsistency and class conflict); and Ian Watt’s “Formal Realism” (Burney perhaps saved the novel from a sharp decline it suffered in the 1770s, even as she tried to distance herself from the genre).  Burney’s most successful writing appeared before the coining of “ideology”. But her standing “prior to ideology” is not a matter of chronological accident. Rather, she quietly but forcefully resisted shared explanations—domesticity as model for household management, debt as basis for family finance, professional status as a means to social confidence, the novel as the dominant literary genre—that became popular during her long and eventful life.  Frederic Jameson has described Paul de Man, “in private conversation,” claiming, “Marxism . . . has no way of understanding the eighteenth century.” Frances Burney and Narrative Prior to Ideology conjoins Burney’s “eighteenth-centuryness” with her modernity.

Disney recognized the challenge, and when the book was translated and imported into the U.S. in 1975, managed to have all 4,000 copies impounded. Ultimately, 1,500 copies of the book were allowed into the country, the rest of the shipment was blocked, and until now no American publisher has dared re-release the book, which sold over a million copies worldwide and has been translated into seventeen languages.

A fiercely patriotic secular Jew, Pavel Bauer is helpless to prevent his world from unraveling as first his government, then his business partners, then his neighbors turn their back on his affluent, once-beloved family. Only the Bauers' adoring governess, Marta, sticks by Pavel, his wife, Anneliese, and their little son, Pepik, bound by her deep affection for her employers and friends. But when Marta learns of their impending betrayal at the hands of her lover, Ernst, Pavel's best friend, she is paralyzed by her own fear of discovery -- even as the endangered family for whom she cares so deeply struggles with the most difficult decision of their lives. Interwoven with a present-day narrative that gradually reveals the fate of the Bauer family during and after the war, Far to Go is a riveting family epic, love story, and psychological drama""--P.

After years struggling with alcohol, critical neglect and depression, Clare finds himself in High Beach Private Asylum - an institution run on reformist principles which would later become known as occupational therapy. At the same time another poet, the young Alfred Tennyson, moves nearby and becomes entangled in the life and catastrophic schemes of the asylum's owner, the peculiar, charismatic Dr Matthew Allen.Based on real events in Epping Forest on the edge of London around 1840, The Quickening Maze centres on the first incarceration of the great nature poet John Clare. After years struggling with alcohol, critical neglect and depression, Clare finds himself in High Beach Private Asylum - an institution run on reformist principles which would later become known as occupational therapy. At the same time another poet, the young Alfred Tennyson, moves nearby and becomes entangled in the life and catastrophic schemes of the asylum's owner, the peculiar, charismatic Dr Matthew Allen.For John Clare, a man who had grown up steeped in the freedoms and exhilarations of nature, who thought 'the edge of the world was a day's walk away', a locked door is a kind of death. This intensely lyrical novel describes his vertiginous fall, through hallucinatory episodes of insanity and dissolving identity, towards his final madness.Historically accurate, but brilliantly imagined, the closed world of High Beach and its various inmates - the doctor, his lonely daughter in love with Tennyson, the brutish staff and John Clare himself - are brought vividly to life. Outside the walls is Nature, and Clare's paradise: the birds and animals, the gypsies living in the forest; his dream of home, of redemption, of escape. Rapturous yet precise, exquisitely written, rich in character and detail, this is a remarkable and deeply affecting book: a visionary novel which contains a world.

Determined not to read Plath's work as if her every act, from childhood on, was a harbinger of her tragic fate, Clark presents new materials about Plath's scientist father, her juvenile writings, and her psychiatric treatment, and evokes a culture in transition in the mid-twentieth century, in the shadow of the atom bomb and the Holocaust, as she explores Sylvia's world: her early relationships and determination not to become a conventional woman and wife; her conflicted ties to her well-meaning, widowed mother; her troubles at the hands of an unenlightened mental-health industry; and her Cambridge years and thunderclap meeting with Ted Hughes, a true marriage of minds that would change the course of poetry in English.  Clark's clear-eyed sympathy for Hughes, his lover Assia Wevill, and other demonized players in the arena of Plath's suicide promotes a deeper understanding of her final days, with their outpouring of first-rate poems. Along with illuminating readings of the poems themselves, Clark's meticulous, compassionate research brings us closer than ever to the spirited woman and visionary artist who blazed a trail that still lights the way for women poets the world over.

Dostoevsky and the affirmation of life,Predrag Cicovacki,literature,First published in 2008,/works/OL2641118W,/authors/OL384894A/Predrag_Cicovacki,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English|Pages 366,"""Dostoevsky's philosophy of life is unfolded in this searching analysis of his five greatest works: Notes from the Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Possessed, and The Brothers Karamazov. Predrag Cicovacki deals with a fundamental issue in Dostoevsky's opus neglected by all of his commentators: How can we affirm life and preserve a healthy optimism in the face of an increasingly troublesome reality? This work displays the vital significance of Dostoevsky's philosophy for understanding the human condition in the twenty-first century. The main task of this insightful effort is to reconstruct and examine Dostoevsky's ""aesthetically"" motivated affirmation of life, based on cycles of transgression and restoration. If life has no meaning, as his central figures claim, it is absurd to affirm life and pointless to live. Since Dostoevsky's doubts concerning the meaning of life resonate so deeply in our own age of pessimism and relativism, the central question of this book, whether Dostoevsky can overcome the skepticism of his most brilliant creation, is innately relevant. This volume includes a thorough literary analysis of Dostoevsky's texts, yet even those who have not read all of these novels will find Cicovacki's analysis interesting and enthralling. The reader will easily extrapolate Cicovacki's own philosophical interpretation of Dostoevsky's literary heritage.""--Provided by publisher.

He might seem to have everything going for him, but Stella is about to realize that there's only thing worse than having a boyfriend with no money ... and that's having one with too much. Jetset lifestyles can be fabulous, but Stella's career as a journalist isn't something she wants to jeopardize for any man, no matter how filthy rich or gorgeous. And then there's her father - a six-times-married prime slice of Alpha Male with a grudge against inherited wealth ... and Jay. There's no denying money makes the world go round and diamonds are a girl's best friend, but they don't make the path to love any easier to tread. With or without the Prada wedges.

World War II has ended, but only in the West. Central Europe is slipping back into its agricultural past.     The bomb has not yet been dropped--nor will it be for twenty years. The Allies have punished Germany for its war crimes by forcing it to revert to a preindustrial age: power stations, railways, factories, and all the machinery of technology have been destroyed or abandoned and left to decay. Moor is a small quarry town (Mauthausen in the all-too-recent past of real history). The occupying American army has installed a camp survivor, Ambras, to govern the local population. Brave, lonely, hated and feared by his former persecutors, Ambras has returned to Moor only because his Jewish wife died there. Setting up house in a derelict villa surrounded by wild hounds that earn him the nickname the Dog King, he chooses another loner, the village boy Bering, as his bodyguard. Moving away from his family and into the compound, the boy enters a new universe of power, of half-glimpsed ideas, of contact with the forbidden world outside. And he meets the only other person Ambras welcomes, a strange and beautiful orphan girl named Lily who lives and hunts in the hills, who knows where the weapons are hidden and forages in the ""free  world for the goods the villagers crave. But Bering's new life begins to unravel as he succumbs to a strange eye disease known as Morbus Kitahara, in which the vision gradually darkens and which tends to afflict marksmen and sharpshooters. Only Lily can find help, can offer them all a possible future.    The three make a courageous bid to escape, and the account of their flight brings the novel to its extraordinarily gripping and suspenseful climax.    Searingly powerful, with a poetic intensity that stays with the reader long after the last page, The Dog King is a modern masterpiece.From the Hardcover edition.

Concentrating on contemporary Nordic literature, the book presents a distinctive view on the spatial turn and widens the understanding of Nordic literature outside of canonized authors. Examining literatures by Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish authors, the chapters investigate a recurrent theme of social criticism and analyze this criticism against the welfare state and power hierarchies in spatial terms. The chapters explore various narrative worlds and spaces—from the urban to parks and forests, from textual spaces to spatial thematics, studying these spatial features in relation to the problems of late modernity.

Rey|Language French|Pages 81,"Rien n'est beau que le vrai, le vrai seul est aimable. Fin d'aout 1805. J'ai vu beaucoup de montagnes en Europe et en Amerique, et il m'a toujours paru que dans les descriptions de ces grands monuments de la nature on allait au dela de la verite. Ma derniere experience a cet egard ne m'a point fait changer de sentiment. J'ai visite la vallee de Chamouny, devenue celebre par les travaux de M. de Saussure ; mais je ne sais si le poete y trouverait le speciosa deserti comme le mineralogiste. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'exposerai avec simplicite les reflexions que j'ai faites dans mon voyage. Mon opinion, d'ailleurs, a trop peu d'autorite pour qu'elle puisse choquer personne. Sorti de Geneve par un temps assez nebuleux, j'arrivai a Servoz au moment ou le ciel commencait a s'eclaircir. La crete du Mont-Blanc ne se decouvre pas de cet endroit, mais on a une vue distincte de sa croupe neigee, appelee le Dome. On franchit ensuite le passage des Montees, et l'on entre dans la vallee de Chamouny. On passe au-dessous du glacier des Bossons ; ses pyramides se montrent a travers les branches des sapins et des melezes, M. Bourrit a compare ce glacier, pour sa blancheur et la coupe allongee de ses cristaux, a une flotte a la voile ; j'ajouterais, au milieu d'un golfe borde de vertes forets. Je m'arretai au village de Chamouny, et le lendemain je me rendis au Montanvert. J'y montai par le plus beau jour de l'annee. Parvenu a son sommet, qui n'est qu'une croupe du Mont-Blanc, je decouvris ce qu'on nomme tres improprement la Mer de Glace. Qu'on se represente une vallee dont le fond est entierement couvert par un fleuve. Les montagnes qui forment cette vallee laissent pendre au-dessus de ce fleuve une masse de rochers, les aiguilles du Dru, du Bochard, des Charmoz. Dans l'enfoncement, la vallee et le fleuve se divisent en deux branches, dont l'une va aboutir a une haute montagne, le Col du Geant, et l'autre aux rochers des Jorasses. Au bout oppose de cette vallee se trouve une pente qui regarde la vallee de Chamouny. Cette pente, presque verticale, est occupee par la portion de la Mer de Glace qu'on appelle le Glacier des Bois. Supposez donc un rude hiver survenu ; le fleuve qui remplit la vallee, ses inflexions et ses pentes, a ete glace jusqu'au fond de son lit ; les sommets des monts voisins se sont charges de neige partout ou les plans du granit ont ete assez horizontaux pour retenir les eaux congelees : voila la Mer de Glace et son site. Ce n'est point, comme on le voit, une mer ; c'est un fleuve ; c'est, si l'on veut, le Rhin glace ; la Mer de Glace sera son cours, et le Glacier des Bois sa chute a Laufen. Lorsqu'on est sur la Mer de Glace, la surface, qui vous en paraissait unie du haut du Montanvert, offre une multitude de pointes et d'anfractuosites. Ces pointes imitent les formes et les dechirures de la haute enceinte de rocs qui surplombent de toutes parts : c'est comme le relief en marbre blanc des montagnes environnantes. Parlons maintenant des montagnes en general.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Criado pela cartomante Antonieta, Mariano aprende a ler a sorte em cartas de baralho. Mas sua protetora morre quando ele ainda é um menino, o que ocasiona de Mariano ser adotado por Madame Iara, uma das clientes de Antonieta. Iara é uma elegante dona de um bordel frequentado pela alta classe da cidade de São Paulo. No bordel, Mariano passa a conviver com as jovens prostitutas sob a firme supervisão de Madame Iara e passa a redigir cartas para elas, conseguindo seu primeiro emprego, o de redator de bordéis, que lhe dá algum dinheiro, que Mariano gasta em boas roupas.

Incorporating studies of Freudian and Marxist approaches to questions of history and memory, this timely collection illuminates how history is being refigured in contemporary literary, cultural and theoretical studies. The contributors to this volume invite the reader to attend to the forms - linguistic, visual, monumental - by which a connection with, or separation from, the past takes place. It is current thinking about memory's relationship to history, and the ongoing critical reassessment of historicism, that preoccupies this collection. The volume explores the ways in which current thinking about the past operates within a dialogic space and can be located in relation to multiple perspectives. Thus cultural memory can be seen not just as a recent development within the field of cultural studies, but as constructing a between-space which also draws in aspects of psychoanalysis. Similarly, trauma theory may usefully be conceptualized as operating in a rich and complex dynamic between deconstruction and the work of Freud. Temporality, memory and the past are attended to here in terms of the dislocations of narrative, of resistances to linear genealogies, to aid the reader in making unanticipated connections between theories and cultures, and between the demands of the psyche and the polis.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Barnes's appreciation extends from France's vanishing peasantry to its hyper-literate pop singers, from the gleeful iconoclasm of nouvelle vague cinema to the orgy of drugs and suffering that is the Tour de France. Above all, Barnes is an unparalleled connoisseur of French writing and writers.  Here are the prolific and priapic Simenon, Baudelaire, Sand and Sartre, and several dazzling excursions on the prickly genius of Flaubert.  Lively yet discriminating in its enthusiasm, seemingly infinite in its range of reference, and written in prose as stylish as haute couture, Something to Declare is an unadulterated joy.From the Trade Paperback edition.

But life seems a lot less rosy when Emilia has to deal with the most neurotic and sheltered five-year-old in New York City: her new stepson William. Now Emilia finds herself trying to flag down taxis with a giant, industrial-strength car seat, looking for perfect, strawberry-flavored, lactose-free cupcakes, receiving corrections on her French pronunciation from her supercilious stepson -- and attempting to find balance in a new family that's both larger, and smaller, than she bargained for. In Love and Other Impossible Pursuits Ayelet Waldman has created a novel rich with humor and truth, perfectly characterizing one woman's search for answers in a crazily uncertain world.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 310,"John Updike has written a brilliant novel that ranks among the most provocative of his distinguished career. Terrorist is the story of Ahmad Ashmawy Mulloy, an alienated American-born teenager who spurns the materialistic, hedonistic life he witnesses in the slumping New Jersey factory town he calls home. Turning to the words of the Holy Qur'an as expounded to him by the pedantic imam of a local mosque, Ahmad devotes himself fervently to God. Neither the world-weary guidance counselor at his high school nor Ahmad's mischievously seductive classmate Joryleen succeeds in deflecting him from his course, as the threads of an insidious plot gather around him.""One compelling and surprising ride.""--USA Today""The startlingly contemporary story of a high school student . . . whose zealous Islamic faith and disaffection with modern life make him a pawn in the larger conflict between Muslim and Christian, East and West. They also make him a powerful voice for Updike's ongoing critique of American civilization.""--Time""A chilling tale that is perhaps the most essential novel to emerge from Sept. 11.""--People (Critic's Choice)From the Trade Paperback edition.

Seit sie zur Taufe durch den spärlichen Flussarm gezogen wurden, fühlen sie sich gewappnet für so ziemlich alles: An Gott glaubt hier keiner, man glaubt an blaue Füchse und an kopflose Löwen.  Eines Tages werden in den umliegenden Wäldern »die Verantwortlichen« gesichtet, mit Bauplänen für ein Erholungsgebiet. Eine Umsiedlung des Ortes steht bevor. Mit allem, was sie haben, lehnen die Bewohner sich auf gegen das Urteil. Aber Widerstand fordert Zusammenhalt, und ein jeder muss zuerst die eigenen Gespenster zähmen oder sie jetzt, im Kampf gegen das Verschwinden, endlich und für alle Zeit freilassen.  Bevor alles verschwindet ist ein Roman wie ein Funkenschlag, wunderbar skurril und von leuchtender Kraft. Eine Geschichte von dunklen Geheimnissen und letzten Hoffnungen, mal unfassbar komisch, dann wieder abgrundtief traurig, immer befreiend − vom ersten Satz bis zum letzten.

Recently emerging scholastic and strategic study concerning the vulnerability of girls is adding a vital missing component to this continually emerging discourse. Looking at many aspects of girls' gendered lives, this text considers the specific perspectives of the social and cultural constructions that script gender, particularly as applies to girls in our classrooms. Prominent scholars in their respective fields examine the myriad forces that shape the lives of American girls, from the earliest didactic records of manuals and books of conduct to current artifacts of contemporary culture. By investigating both the scholarly literature on girls as well as well as the primary sources of a material culture, the authors seek to unravel how adolescent girls learn and seek to compose identities. By closely examining girls' practices, in which are embedded issues of class, race, ethnicity, immigrant status, and sexuality, the text considers some of the values, structures, and trajectories that have come to define teenage girlhood. Its distinctive contribution is to unpack some of the assumptions of girls in English classrooms and to critically examine their experiences as they try to fit preconceived norms while forming their own personhood""-- Provided by publisher.

Don't Call Us Dead opens with a heartrending sequence that imagines an afterlife for black men shot by police, a place where suspicion, violence, and grief are forgotten and replaced with the safety, love, and longevity they deserved here on earth. Smith turns then to desire, mortality--the dangers experienced in skin and body and blood--and a diagnosis of HIV positive. Some of us are killed / in pieces, Smith writes, some of us all at once.  Don't Call Us Dead is an astonishing and ambitious collection, one that confronts, praises, and rebukes America--Dear White America--where every day is too often a funeral and not often enough a miracle.

It offers an eyewitness account of the last years of Domitian's principate, the reign of Nerva and Trajan's early years, and it communicates a detailed senatorial view on the behaviour expected of an emperor. It is an important document in the development of the ideals of imperial leadership, but it also contributes greatly to our understanding of imperial political culture more generally. This volume, the first ever devoted to the Panegyricus, contains expert studies of its key historical and rhetorical contexts, as well as important critical approaches to the published version of the speech and its influence in antiquity. It offers scholars of Roman history, literature and rhetoric an up-to-date overview of key approaches to the speech, and students and interested readers an authoritative introduction to this vital and under-appreciated speech""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Gail Lim, a producer of radio documentaries, is haunted by the mystery of her father's Asian past.  As a child, Gail's father, Matthew Lim, lived in a Malaysian village occupied by the Japanese. He and his beloved Ani wandered the jungle fringe under the terrifying shadow of war. The war shattered their families, splitting the two apart until a brief reunion years later. Matthew's profound connection to Ani and the life-changing secrets they shared cast a shadow that, later still, Matthew's wife, Clara, desperately sought to understand.  Gail's journey to unravel the mystery of her parents' lives takes her to Amsterdam, where she unearths more about this mysterious other woman. But as Gail approaches the truth, Ani's story will bring Gail face-to-face, with the untold mysteries of her own life.  Vivid, poignant, and written in understated yet powerful prose, CERTAINTY is a novel about the legacies of loss, the dislocations of war, and the timeless redemption afforded by love.

Knopf|Language English|Pages 307,"From one of our most admired fiction writers: the searing story of breakdown and recovery in the life of one man and of a society moving from one idea of itself to another.Keith--born in England in the early 1960s to immigrant West Indian parents but primarily raised by his white stepmother--is a social worker heading a Race Equality unit in London whose life has come undone. He is separated from his wife of twenty years (whose family ""let her go"" when she married a black man), kept at arm's length by his seventeen-year-old son, estranged from his father, and accused of harassment by a co-worker. And beneath it all, he has a desperate feeling that his work--even in fact his life--is no longer relevant.Moving deftly between past and present, the narrative uncovers the particulars of class, background, temperament, and desire that have brought Keith to this moment, and reveals how, often unwittingly, his wife, his son, and, ultimately, his father help him grasp the breadth of the changes that have occurred around him--and what these changes will require of him.At once intimate and expansive, deeply moving in its portrayal of the vagaries of familial love and bold in its scrutiny of the personal and societal politics of race, this is Caryl Phillips's most powerful novel yet.From the Hardcover edition.

The Routledge Handbook of African Literature is a one-stop publication bringing together studies of African literary texts that embody an array of newer approaches applied to a wide range of works. This includes frameworks derived from food studies, utopian studies, network theory, eco-criticism, and examinations of the human/animal interface alongside more familiar discussions of postcolonial politics.  The handbook is divided into seven parts, i) Mapping political agencies ii) Journeys, geographies, identities iii) Working through genre iv) The world of and beyond humans v) Everyday sociality vi) Bodies, subjectivities, affect vii) Literary networks. In each, contributors address the themes of the section from a variety of perspectives in conjunction with analysis of different literary texts. Every chapter is an original research essay written by a broad spectrum of scholars with expertise in the subject, providing an application of the most recent insights into analysis of particular topics or application of particular critical frameworks to one or more African literary works.  The handbook will be a valuable interdisciplinary resource for scholars and students of African literature, African culture, postcolonial literature and literary analysis.

Zaffarano, the superagent cousin with enough mob connections to topple the family empire, she was his ticket to the top and a necessary ally...

But when Danny's family falls on hard times, moving from their comfortable home in Brooklyn to Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side, he is forced to leave his carefree childhood behind. Facing poverty and daily encounters with his violent, anti-Semitic neighbors, Danny must fight both inside and outside the ring just to survive.  As his boxing becomes legendary in the city's seedy underworld, packed with wiseguys and loose women, everyone seems to want a hand in Danny's success. Robbins's colorful, fast-talking characters evoke the rough streets of Depression-era New York City. Ronnie, a prostitute ashamed of how far she's fallen and desperately in need of friendship; Sam, a slick bookie who wants to profit from Danny's boxing talent; and Nellie, a beautiful but lonely girl who refuses to believe Danny is beyond redemption each of whom has a different vision of Danny's future will help steer his rocky course.  Gritty, compelling, and groundbreaking for its time, A Stone for Danny Fisher is a tale of ambition, hope, and violence set in a distinct and dangerous period of American history.--Goodreads   Read more Read less",13 Want to read|2 Currently reading|1 Have read

Beginning with a childhood informed by pop-culture robots in movies, in comic books, and on TV in the 1960s to adulthood where the possibilities of self-driving cars and virtual reality are daily conversation, Terri Favro offers a unique perspective on how our relationship with robotics and futuristic technologies has shifted over time. Peppered with pop-culture fun-facts about Superman's kryptonite, the human-machine relationships in the cult TV show Firefly, and the sexual and moral implications of the film Ex Machina, Generation Robot explores how the techno-triumphs and resulting anxieties of reality bleed into the fantasies of our collective culture. Clever and accessible, Generation Robot isn't just for the serious, scientific reader--it's for everyone interested in robotics and technology since their science-fiction origins. By looking back at the future she once imagined, analyzing the plugged-in present, and speculating on what is on the horizon, Terri Favro allows readers the chance to consider what was, what is, and what could be. This is a captivating book that looks at the pop-culture of our society to explain how the world works--now and tomorrow""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Langley|Language English|Pages 172,"Oswald lord Nelvil, pair d'ecosse, partit d'edimbourg pour se rendre en Italie pendant l'hiver de 1794 a 1795.  Il avait une figure noble et belle, beaucoup d'esprit, un grand nom, une fortune independante ; mais sa sante etait alteree par un profond sentiment de peine, et les medecins, craignant que sa poitrine ne fut attaquee, lui avaient ordonne l'air du midi. Il suivit leurs conseils, bien qu'il mit peu d'interet a la conservation de ses jours. Il esperait du moins trouver quelque distraction dans la diversite des objets qu'il allait voir. La plus intime de toutes les douleurs, la perte d'un pere, etait la cause de sa maladie ; des circonstances cruelles, des remords inspires par des scrupules delicats aigrissaient encore ses regrets, et l'imagination y melait ses fantomes. Quand on souffre, on se persuade aisement que l'on est coupable, et les violens chagrins portent le trouble jusques dans la conscience.  a vingt-cinq ans il etait decourage de la vie ; son esprit jugeait tout d'avance, et sa sensibilite blessee ne goutait plus les illusions du coeur. Personne ne se montrait plus que lui complaisant et devoue pour ses amis quand il pouvait leur rendre service, mais rien ne lui causait un sentiment de plaisir, pas meme le bien qu'il faisait ; il sacrifiait sans cesse et facilement ses gouts a ceux d'autrui ; mais on ne pouvait expliquer par la generosite seule cette abnegation absolue de tout egoisme ; et l'on devait souvent l'attribuer au genre de tristesse qui ne lui permettait plus de s'interesser a son propre sort. Les indifferens jouissaient de ce caractere, et le trouvaient plein de graces et de charmes ; mais quand on l'aimait, on sentait qu'il s'occupait du bonheur des autres comme un homme qui n'en esperait pas pour lui-meme ; et l'on etait presque afflige de ce bonheur qu'il donnait sans qu'on put le lui rendre.

Empress Wu, one of China's most controversial figures, was its first and only female emperor, who emerged in the seventh century during the great Tang Dynasty and ushered in a golden age. Throughout history, her name has been defamed and her story distorted by those taking vengeance on a woman who dared to become emperor. But now, for the first time in thirteen centuries, Empress Wu (or Heavenlight, as we come to know her) flings open the gates of the Forbidden City and tells her own astonishing tale—revealing a fascinating, complex figure who in many ways remains modern to this day.Writing with epic assurance, poetry, and vivid historic detail, Shan Sa plumbs the psychological and philosophical depths of what it means to be a striving mortal in a tumultuous, power-hungry world. Empress is a great literary feat and a revelation for the ages.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

In order to sign the impossibly sexy, brilliant, and successful artist Shamus Montgomery to do a show of his celebrated erotic sculptures, Mercy must meet his curious but absolutely non-negotiable demand—she must pose for him in the nude, day after day, or he walks. Never one to back down from a challenge, Mercy agrees. Burning under the intense gaze of the hottest man she’s ever known, watching his hands work their magic, Mercy feels vulnerable yet liberated and fully aroused, desperate for the kind of satisfaction only a master like Shamus can give. In fact, she would beg him to cross the line. And once he does, mercy is the last thing she desires…   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book was an immediate bestseller, and an expanded edition with Volume 2 was published in 1726. Written when many of the pirates described were still roaming the sea, the stories included vivid descriptions of the famous rogues, Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Bartholomew Roberts, along with female pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny. In fact, it was this book that established the reputations of many of these pirates. Originally published by ""Capt. Charles Johnson,"" an American Defoe scholar attributed this work to Daniel Defoe in 1932. As a result, Defoe was widely accepted as the author of this book. This is still accepted by many today, although modern scholars have presented evidence that Defoe may not have been the author--the issue of authorship remains a subject for debate.

Written in an elaborately baroque style, the narrative follows the childhood and youth of José Cemí, and depicts many scenes which resonate with Lezama's own life as a young poet in Havana. Many of the characters reappear in Lezama's posthumous novel Oppiano Licario, which was published in Mexico in 1977.  The novel relates Cemí's struggles with a mysterious childhood illness, describes the death of his father, and explores his homosexuality and literary sensibilities. He lives in the world of pre-Castro Havana, and the Cuban Revolution only appears as a secondary plot. Some of the later chapters incorporate narrative experiments in which several alternating stories, set during widely divergent eras and having no immediately apparent connection with José Cemí, are interwoven and eventually merged. (In a letter to Julio Cortázar, Lezama explained that these chapters represent Cemí's dreams after the death of his father.[1]) Because of the graphic homosexual scenes and the novel's ambivalence towards the political situation of the day, Paradiso encountered controversy and publication problems. Today it is widely read in the Spanish-speaking world but has not achieved the same fame in English-speaking countries despite a translation by Gregory Rabassa.

A childhood robbed of innocence set off a chain of events that she still has not managed to control, no matter how hard she tries. Every time she thinks she has a handle on things, unexpected turns make her question everything, including herself. When Lupita witnesses the murder of a local politician whom she greatly admires, the ghosts of her past resurface as she tries to cope with the present. She quickly falls back into her old self-destructive habits and becomes a target of Mexico corrupt political machine. As the powers that be kick into high gear to ensure the truth remains hidden, Lupita finds solace in the purity of indigenous traditions. While she learns how to live simply, like her ancestors, she comes to understand herself and rediscovers light within a dark life. And if there is hope for Lupita redemption, perhaps there is hope for Mexico.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

P. Putnam's Sons|Language English,""" From the #1 New York Times- and Wall Street Journal-bestselling author comes the dramatic second adventure in the brand-new Clandestine Operations series about the Cold War, the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency-and a new breed of warrior. In Top Secret, W.E.B. Griffin introduced a remarkable new cast of heroes as they found themselves on the front lines of an entirely different kind of war. Now, these men and women are going to find out what they've really gotten themselves into. James Cronley thought he had done well-he didn't know he'd done this well. His first successful mission for the about-to-be-official new Central Intelligence Directorate has drawn all kinds of attention, some welcome, some not. On the plus side, he's now a captain; promoted to Chief, DCI, Europe; and in charge of a top secret spy operation. On the minus side, a lot of people would like to know about that operation, including not only the Soviets, but his own Pentagon, as well as a seething J. Edgar Hoover. Cronley knows that if just one thing goes wrong, he's likely to get thrown to the wolves. As if that weren't enough pressure, complications are springing up on all sides. He's discovered a surprising alliance between the former German intelligence chief and, of all things, the Mossad. A German family that Cronley never knew he had has suddenly, and suspiciously, emerged. And he's due for a rendezvous with an undercover agent against the Soviets known only as Seven K. It's when he meets Seven K that he gets the real surprise. ""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Since 1943 hundreds of plane and ships, and thousands of people, have disappeared in the ocean between Bermuda and the Florida coast, the Bermuda Triangle. A squadron of five airplanes have gone missing, a ship was found abandoned with no sign of the crew or passengers.   Charles Berlitz set out to investigate and has spoken to numerous people who have escaped the terrifying forces of the Bermuda Triangle. The explanations he finds seem to be impossible but no-one has found more plausible suggestions: Are UFO's responsible? Is it due to space-time warps created by long-vanished civilizations?

On the glittering shores of the Mediterranean in 1928, a dying author in exile races to complete his final novel. Lady Chatterley’s Lover is a sexually bold love story, a searing indictment of class distinctions and a study in sensuality. But the author, D. H. Lawrence, knows it will be censored. He publishes it privately, loses his copies to customs and dies bereft.  Booker Prize-longlisted author Alison MacLeod brilliantly recreates the novel’s origins and boldly imagines its journey to freedom through the story of Jackie Kennedy, who was known to be an admirer. In MacLeod’s telling, Jackie - in her last days before becoming first lady - learns that publishers are trying to bring D. H. Lawrence’s long-censored novel to American and British readers in its full form. The US government has responded by targeting the postal service for distributing obscene material. Enjoying what anonymity she has left, determined to honour a novel she loves, Jackie attends the hearing incognito. But there she is quickly recognized and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover takes note of her interest and her outrage.  Through the story of Lawrence’s writing of Lady Chatterley’s Lover, the historic obscenity trial that sought to suppress it in the United Kingdom, and the men and women who fought for its worldwide publication, Alison MacLeod captures the epic sweep of the 20th century from war and censorship to sensuality and freedom. Exquisite, evocative and grounded in history, Tenderness is a testament to the transformative power of fiction. - Provided by Publisher   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sebald (1944-2001) and the Austrian author Christoph Ransmayr (1954- ) were born too late to know directly the violence of the Second World War and the Holocaust, but these traumatic events are a persistent presence in their work. In a series of close readings of key prose texts, Dora Osborne examines the different ways in which the traces of a traumatic past mark their narratives. By focusing on the authors' use of visual and topographical tropes, she shows how blind spots and inhospitable places configure signs of past violence, but, ultimately, resist our understanding. Whilst links between the two authors are well-documented, this book offers the first full-length study of Sebald and Ransmayr and their complicated relation to the traumatic traces of National Socialism.

"Shakespeare, the Queen's Men, and the Elizabethan performance of history",Brian Walsh,literature,First published in 2009,/works/OL15500022W?edition=ia%3Ashakespearequeen00wals_924,/authors/OL2808478A/Brian_Walsh,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24461931M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""The Elizabethan history play was one of the most prevalent dramatic genres of the 1590s, and so was a major contribution to Elizabethan historical culture. The genre has been well served by critical studies that emphasize politics and ideology; however, there has been less interest in the way history is interrogated as an idea in these plays. Drawing in period-sensitive ways on the field of contemporary performance theory, Walsh looks at the Shakespearean history play from a fresh angle, by first analyzing the foundational work of the Queen's Men, the playing company that invented the popular history play. Through innovative readings of their plays including The Famous Victories of Henry V before moving on to Shakespeare's 1 Henry VI, Richard III, and Henry V, this book investigates how the Queen's Men's self-consciousness about performance helped to shape Shakespeare's dramatic and historical imagination""--Provided by publisher.  ""Longing on a large scale is what makes history."" Don DeLillo, Underworld In his 1589 treatise The Arte of English Poesie, George Puttenham diagnosed the limited ability of humans to perceive history. The past, according to Puttenham, is that which ""we are not able [ . . . ] to attaine to the knowledge of, by any of our ences."" History is defined by its inalienable absence. It exists only in forms of textual or pictorial representation, such as prose works, poetry, and illustrations, or in embodied acts such as storytelling and theatrical playing. In sixteenth-century England, these forms flourished as varying responses to a heightened awareness of the absence of history, an awareness that the intellectual ambitions of the Renaissance precipitated. Of all the forms of history, performance alone supplies a pretense of sensual contact with the vanished past through the bodies that move and speak on stage. The history plays that I consider in this book, from the repertory of the Queen's Men and by Shakespeare, grew out of a vibrant Elizabethan historical culture, and they in turn helped to shape a new historical outlook""--Provided by publisher.

Jane Austen and the fiction of her time,Mary Waldron,literature,First published in 1999,/works/OL1969396W?edition=ia%3Ajaneaustenfictio00wald,/authors/OL236595A/Mary_Waldron,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL379542M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 194,"This book presents Jane Austen as a radical innovator. It explores the nature of her confrontation with the popular novelists of her time, and demonstrates how her challenge to them transformed fiction. It is evident from letters and other sources, as well as the novels themselves, that the Austen family developed a strong scepticism about contemporary notions of the proper content and purpose of fiction. Austen's own writing can be seen as a conscious demonstration of these disagreements. In thus identifying her literary motivation, this book (moving away from the questions of ideology which have so dominated Austen studies in this century) offers a unifying critique of the novels and helps to explain their unequalled durability with the reading public.

A chance encounter with quiet, alluring Merridy Bowman—a young woman similarly haunted by a tangled and catastrophic history—results in marriage, as two damaged souls unite to build a home, family, and livelihood far removed from civilization's bustle. Soon they are drawn into the unpredictable dynamics of small-town island life—and into the destructive orbit of an unscrupulous real estate agent who maintains a secret hold over both Doves. But when a shipwreck off the shore thrusts a troubled, possibly criminal teenage castaway into their world, Alex and Merridy's tenuously forged happiness is suddenly at grave risk, as they are forced to confront deeper questions about the true meaning of fulfillment.

Margaret started her writing career by helping to shape the curriculum for the Bank Street School for Children, making it her mission to create stories that would rise above traditional fairy tales and allowed girls to see themselves as equals to boys. At the same time, she also experimented endlessly with her own writing. Margaret embraced life with passion, lived extravagantly off of her royalties, went on rabbit hunts, and carried on long and troubled love affairs with both men and women. One of great loves in Margaret's life was a gender-bending poet and ex-wife of John Barrymore who went by the stage name of Michael Strange. She and Margaret had a tempestuous yet secret relationship, at one point living next door to each other. After the dissolution of their relationship and Michael's death, Margaret became engaged to a younger man who also happened to be the son of a Rockefeller and a Carnegie. But before they could marry Margaret died unexpectedly at the age of forty-two, leaving behind a cache of unpublished work and a timeless collection of books that would go on to become classics in children's literature.

Religion's most passionate antagonists -- Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and others -- have publishers competing eagerly to market their various denunciations of religion, monotheism, Christianity, and Roman Catholicism. But contemporary antireligious polemics are based not only upon profound conceptual confusions but upon facile simplifications of history or even outright historical ignorance: so contends David Bentley Hart in this bold correction of the distortions. One of the most brilliant scholars of religion of our time, Hart provides a powerful antidote to the New Atheists' misrepresentations of the Christian past, bringing into focus the truth about the most radical revolution in Western history. Hart outlines how Christianity transformed the ancient world in ways we may have forgotten: bringing liberation from fatalism, conferring great dignity on human beings, subverting the cruelest aspects of pagan society, and elevating charity above all virtues. He then argues that what we term the ""Age of Reason"" was in fact the beginning of the eclipse of reason's authority as a cultural value. Hart closes the book in the present, delineating the ominous consequences of the decline of Christendom in a culture that is built upon its moral and spiritual values. - Jacket flap.

The introduction seeks both to discuss the problems in the use of these two terms in relation to late nineteenth-century fiction and to describe the history of previous efforts to make the terms expressive of American writing of this period. The Companion includes ten essays which fall into four categories: essays on the historical context of realism and naturalism by Louis Budd and Richard Lehan; essays on critical approaches to the movements since the early 1970s by Michael Anesko, essays on the efforts to expand the canon of realism and naturalism by Elizabeth Ammons; and a full-scale discussion of ten major texts, from W. D. Howell's The Rise of Silas Lapham to Jack London's The Call of the Wild, by John W. Crowley, Tom Quirk, J. C. Levenson, Blanche Gelfant, Barbara Hochman, and Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin.

Inside, Outside sweeps through more than sixty years, from the pre-war, pre-atomic innocence of the twenties and thirties to the turbulent immediate past. Scenes of rollicking family humour and show-business comedy alternate with sudden tragedy, the spectacle of a falling President and the explosion of war. A bittersweet first love, relived after forty years, and a tense secret wartime mission between Washington and Jerusalem call forth the author's renowned storytelling gift. An intense, personal book about intimate things, Inside, Outside is a merry, poignant, sometimes ribald picture of the American Jewish experience, by a master at the peak of his powers.

The Resistance is in ruins. In the wake of their harrowing escape from Crait, what was once an army has been reduced to a handful of wounded heroes. Finn, Poe, Rey, Rose, Chewbacca, Leia Organa—their names are famous among the oppressed worlds they fight to liberate. But names can only get you so far, and Leia’s last desperate call for aid has gone unanswered.  From the jungles of Ryloth to the shipyards of Corellia, the shadow of the First Order looms large, and those with the bravery to face the darkness are scattered and isolated. If hope is to survive, the Resistance must journey throughout the galaxy, seeking out more leaders—including those who, in days gone by, helped a nascent rebellion topple an empire. Battles will be fought, alliances will be forged, and the Resistance will be reborn.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide--for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life--and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete--and her time on earth will be finished.Already an international literary sensation, the Gargoyle is an Inferno for our time. It will have you believing in the impossible.   Read more Read less",13 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Donna Heiland's Gothic and Gender offers a historically informed theoretical introduction to key gothic narratives from a feminist perspective.    The book concentrates primarily on fiction from the 1760s through the 1840s, exploring the work of Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Sophia Lee, Matthew Lewis, Charlotte Dacre, Charles Maturin, Ann Radcliffe, William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley, John Polidori, James Malcolm Rymer, Emily Bronte, Charlotte Bronte, Charlotte Smith, and Charles Brockden Brown. The final chapter looks at contemporary fiction and its relation to the gothic, including an exploration of Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin and Ann-Marie Macdonald's Fall on Your Knees    A Coda provides an overview of scholarship on the gothic, showing how gothic gradually became a major focus for literary critics, and paying particular attention to the feminist reinvigoration of gothic studies that began in the 1970s and continues today.    Taken as a whole the book offers a stimulating survey of the representation of gender in the gothic, suitable for both students and readers of gothic literature.

By the end of the book, you might be ready for more ""advanced"" techniques -- including multiple orgasms, multiple partners, anal sex, and more. Whatever you choose to use, or leave to the realm of fantasy, all of it is designed to help you and your partner have the most satisfying sex ever.So take your sex life to a higher level -- to a place where inhibitions fall away and creativity and a sense of adventure flourish!

Casey Andrews loves sex...but she wants to be loved as well. Of course, being blessed (or cursed?) with a body that renders most men speechless isn't exactly conducive to post-coital cuddling, much less the possibility of commitment to anything except...more sex. Not that there's anything wrong with the fantastic romps she's had with Connor Grant, head of security at the Holman Gallery—if sheet-scorching encounters were all she wanted. But Casey has other needs—needs that Connor, as gifted as he is, can't satisfy. Enter—ahem—Detective Shawn Tranner. Six feet plus of dark, muscled charm, Casey's new neighbor should know better than to take his morning run wearing nothing but a tiny pair of red shorts. At first, Shawn's merely an object of temptation, but when he comes to Casey's rescue during a home invasion, he becomes her real-life knight in shining armor...and so much more. A single glance from Shawn is enough to arouse Casey for hours. His every touch sends her senses reeling. The perfect gentleman and the perfect lover, Shawn could be the man of Casey's dreams.

We follow the Wu family--father Nan, mother Pingping, and son Taotao--as they fully sever their ties with China in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and begin a new, free life in the United States.At first, their future seems well-assured--Nan's graduate work in political science at Brandeis University would guarantee him a teaching position in China--but after the fallout from Tiananmen, Nan's disillusionment turns him towards his first love, poetry. Leaving his studies, he takes on a variety of menial jobs while Pingping works for a wealthy widow as a cook and housekeeper. As Nan struggles to adapt to a new language and culture, his love of poetry and literature sustains him through difficult, lean years. Ha Jin creates a moving, realistic, but always hopeful narrative as Nan moves from Boston to New York to Atlanta, ever in search of financial stability and success, even in a culture that sometimes feels oppressive and hostile. As Pingping and Taotao slowly adjust to American life, Nan still feels a strange, paradoxical attachment to his homeland, though he violently disagrees with Communist policy. And severing all ties--including his love for a woman who rejected him in his youth--proves to be more difficult than he could have ever imagined.Ha Jin's prodigious talents are evident in this powerful new book, which brilliantly brings to life the struggles and successes that characterize the contemporary immigrant experience. With its lyrical prose and confident grace, A Free Life is a luminous addition to the works of one of the preeminent writers in America today.From the Hardcover edition.

Six years later, Paul's death reunites his sons at Tealing, their idyllic childhood home, where Fenno, the eldest, faces a choice that puts him at the center of his family's future. A lovable, slightly repressed gay man, Fenno leads the life of an aloof expatriate in the West Village, running a shop filled with books and birdwatching gear. He believes himself safe from all emotional entanglements--until a worldly neighbor presents him with an extraordinary gift and a seductive photographer makes him an unwitting subject. Each man draws Fenno into territories of the heart he has never braved before, leading him toward an almost unbearable loss that will reveal to him the nature of love. Love in its limitless forms--between husband and wife, between lovers, between people and animals, between parents and children--is the force that moves these characters' lives, which collide again, in yet another June, over a Long Island dinner table. This time it is Fenno who meets and captivates Fern, the same woman who captivated his father in Greece ten years before. Now pregnant with a son of her own, Fern, like Fenno and Paul before him, must make peace with her past to embrace her future. Elegantly detailed yet full of emotional suspense, often as comic as it is sad, Three Junes is a glorious triptych about how we learn to live, and live fully, beyond incurable grief and betrayals of the heart--how family ties, both those we're born into and those we make, can offer us redemption and joy.From the Hardcover edition.

Melville and the idea of blackness,Christopher Freeburg,literature,First published in 2012,/works/OL16564530W,/authors/OL7099679A/Christopher_Freeburg,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"By examining the unique problems that ""blackness"" signifies in Moby-Dick, Pierre, ""Benito Cereno,"" and ""The Encantadas,"" Christopher Freeburg analyzes how Herman Melville grapples with the social realities of racial difference in nineteenth-century America. Where Melville's critics typically read blackness as either a metaphor for the haunting power of slavery or an allegory of moral evil, Freeburg asserts that blackness functions as the site where Melville correlates the sociopolitical challenges of transatlantic slavery and U.S. colonial expansion with philosophical concerns about mastery. By focusing on Melville's iconic interracial encounters, Freeburg reveals the important role blackness plays in Melville's portrayal of characters' arduous attempts to seize their own destiny, amass scientific knowledge, and perfect themselves. A valuable resource for scholars and graduate students in American literature, this text will also appeal to those working in American, African American, and postcolonial studies.

The three boys and a friend board the Braithwaites' forty-six-foot schooner and begin a perilous journey down the East Coast, bound for the Florida Keys. A storm abruptly ends their passage, leaving them stranded in Cuba, but when they telegraph their father for help, he does not respond. After their ordeal is over, no one in the family ever again mentions the voyage.Now, almost a century later, Cyrus's great-granddaughter Sybil is determined to know the hidden heart of the story: Why did Cyrus send his sons to sea? Why was their mother in a Boston hospital? What role was played in the drama by Lockwood Braithwaite, the enigmatic child of Cyrus's first marriage? Sybil's discoveries will change the way she thinks about herself, her family, and the America whose ideals the Braithwaites once embodied.The author of A Rumor of War -- acclaimed as one of the great books about Vietnam -- here gives us a rich and gripping tale of adventure, courage, and the persisting effects of long-held secrets. The Voyage is a powerful novel about a family whose ways and deeds were once a template for the nation.From the Hardcover edition.

He goes first to see his estranged, decades-older half-brother; then his dying father, whose notorious early life still haunts his children; and finally the ex-wife he cannot help but continue to love. But a fourth encounter—violent, unexpected—sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change Paul’s life, as well as the family he’s struggled so long to understand.Ian MacKenzie’s stirring and lyrical debut is a story of a family inalterably fractured by its past, of a man who refuses to believe that what is done cannot be undone, and of a world that insists—catastrophically, in the end—otherwise.

Set during the boom-and-bust years of the 1980s, An Absolute Scandal follows the lives of a group of people drawn together by their mutual monetary woes when the great financial institution Lloyd's undergoes a devastating downturn. For Nigel Cowper, this means the destruction of his family business; his wife, Lucinda, is willing to do everything she can to help him--except give up her irresistible lover. The powerful, charismatic banker Simon Beaumont and his wife, a highly successful advertising executive, lose everything they worked so hard to acquire; but the ultimate tragedy is something that neither one could have anticipated. The well-to-do are not the only ones suffering: a self-sufficient widow is suddenly deep in debt; a single mother struggles to maintain a comfortable home for her children; and a schoolmaster and his frustrated wife find that financial problems deepen the cracks in their troubled marriage. As their lives begin a downward spiral, these characters intersect in ways they never saw coming. Written in what has become her signature style of both wit and candor, Penny Vincenzi draws back the curtain and offers an inside view of the greed and social power plays that occur behind the closed doors of upper-crust society . . . where money isn't everything. Sometimes, it's the only thing.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Small World is an entirely contemporary and engrossing page-turner which explores universal themes of love, death, friendship, marriage, madness, and redemption, unifying them all through this central question...Friends, family, workmates. The woman you see at the bus stop every morning; the man who reaches for the last newspaper just before you get to it. Everyone you meet, and some you nearly meet, will have an impact on the way your day goes. Small World is the story of a group of men and women, living and working in a city, who are connected through love, work, friendship, or simply by virtue of proximity. We connect with the hearts and minds of characters including an all-coping housewife, a stressed out working mother, a put-upon nanny, a long-suffering journalist, an Indian waiter who dreams of stardom, a grieving shop assistant, a stand-up comic and a psychotic policeman – all of whom speak directly to us about their innermost thoughts, fears and desires in a series of interwoven first-person narratives.

(Lisa Appignanesi, author of Unholy Loves)Chris Carver is living a lie. His wife, their teenage daughter, and everyone in their circle know himas Michael Frame, suburban dad. They have no idea that as a radical student in the sixties hebriefly became a terrorist—protesting the Vietnam War by setting bombs around London. Andthen one day a ghost from his past turns up on his doorstep, forcing Chris on the run.As Chris flees, he remembers his days as an isolated youth, hopelessly in love with AnnaAddison, following her as she threw aside conventionality. Chris's rival for Anna's affections, thecharismatic Sean Ward, was the leader of the radical August 14th Group. Egging one another on,the three inched closer and closer to the edge, until the events of one horrifying night forced themapart, never to see one another again.Gripping, moving, provocative, and passionate, My Revolutions brings to brilliant life boththe radical idealism of the sixties and the darker currents that ran beneath it, the eddies of whichstill shape our history today.

Talese,              Nan A. Talese/Doubleday|Pages 223","The prodigiously talented Jim Crace has returned with a new novel that explores the complexities of love and violence with a scenario that juxtaposes humor and human aspiration. British jazzman Leonard Lessing spent a memorable yet unsuccessful few days in Austin, Texas, trying to seduce a woman he fancied. During his stay, he became caught up in her messy life, which included a new lover, a charismatic but carelessly violent man named Maxie.Eighteen years later, Maxie enters Leonard's life again, but this time in England, where he is armed and holding hostages. Leonard must decide whether to sit silently by as the standoff unfolds or find the courage to go to the crime scene where he could potentially save lives. The lives of two mothers and two daughters--all strikingly independent and spirited--hang in the balance.Set in Texas and the suburbs of England, All That Follows is a novel in which tender, unheroic moments triumph over the more strident and aggressive facets of our age. It also provides moving and surprising insights into the conflict between our private and public lives and redefines heroism in this new century. It is a masterful work from one of Britain's brightest literary lights.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A family so close and loving that Natalie believed they were the envy of the nearby town of Wakefield - particularly her eldest brother Boyer, whom Natalie held especially close to her heart. But Natalie began to question her family's idyllic existence the summer she turned fifteen. The arrival of a soft-spoken stranger, an American draft-dodger called River, would test the morals and beliefs of the family and the community to breaking point. The series of events following that summer day would leave relationships shattered and the Ward family changed forever.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, and Michael Herr emerged and joined a few of their pioneering elders, including Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, to remake American letters. The perfect chroniclers of an age of frenzied cultural change, they were blessed with the insight that traditional tools of reporting would prove inadequate to tell the story of a nation manically hopscotching from hope to doom and back again--from war to rock, assassination to drugs, hippies to Yippies, Kennedy to the dark lord Nixon. Traditional just-the-facts reporting simply couldn't provide a neat and symmetrical order to this chaos.Marc Weingarten has interviewed many of the major players to provide a startling behind-the-scenes account of the rise and fall of the most revolutionary literary outpouring of the postwar era, set against the backdrop of some of the most turbulent--and significant--years in contemporary American life. These are the stories behind those stories, from Tom Wolfe's white-suited adventures in the counterculture to Hunter S. Thompson's drug-addled invention of gonzo to Michael Herr's redefinition of war reporting in the hell of Vietnam. Weingarten also tells the deeper backstory, recounting the rich and surprising history of the editors and the magazines who made the movement possible, notably the three greatest editors of the era--Harold Hayes at Esquire, Clay Felker at New York, and Jann Wenner at Rolling Stone. And finally Weingarten takes us through the demise of the New Journalists, a tragedy of hubris, miscalculation, and corporate menacing.This is the story of perhaps the last great good time in American journalism, a time when writers didn't just cover stories but immersed themselves in them, and when journalism didn't just report America but reshaped it.""Within a seven-year period, a group of writers emerged, seemingly out of nowhere--Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Joan Didion, John Sack, Michael Herr--to impose some order on all of this American mayhem, each in his or her own distinctive manner (a few old hands, like Truman Capote and Norman Mailer, chipped in, as well). They came to tell us stories about ourselves in ways that we couldn't, stories about the way life was being lived in the sixties and seventies and what it all meant to us. The stakes were high; deep fissures were rending the social fabric, the world was out of order. So they became our master explainers, our town criers, even our moral conscience--the New Journalists."" --from the IntroductionFrom the Hardcover edition.

Simone Weil's Apologetic Use of Literature,Marie Cabaud Meaney,literature,First published in 2007,/works/OL9332293W?edition=ia%3Asimoneweilsapolo00mean,/authors/OL3378108A/Marie_Cabaud_Meaney,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21097372M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 245,"Marie Cabaud Meaney looks at Simone Weil's Christological interpretations of the Sophoclean Antigone and Electra, the Iliad and Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound. Apart from her article on the Iliad, Weil's interpretations are not widely known, probably because they are fragmentary and boldly twist the classics, sometimes even contradicting their literal meaning. Meaney argues that Weil had an apologetic purpose in mind: to the spiritual ills of ideology and fanaticism in World War II she wanted to give a spiritual answer, namely the re-Christianization of Europe to which she (though not baptized herself) wished to contribute in some way. To the intellectual agnostics of her day she intended to show through her interpretations that the texts they cherished so much could only be fully understood in light of Christ; to the Catholics she sought to reveal that Catholicism was much more universal than generally believed, since Greek culture already embodied the Christian spirit - perhaps to a greater extent than the Catholic Church ever had. Despite or perhaps because of this apologetic slant, Weil's readings uncover new layers of these familiar texts: Antigone is a Christological figure, combating Creon's ideology of the State by a folly of love that leads her to a Passion in which she experiences an abandonment similar to that of Christ on the Cross. The Iliad depicts a world as yet unredeemed, but which traces objectively the reign of force to which both oppressors and oppressed are subject. Prometheus Bound becomes the vehicle of her theodicy, in which she shows that suffering only makes sense in light of the Cross. But the pinnacle of the spiritual life is described in Electra which, she believes, reflects a mystical experience - something Weil herself had experienced unexpectedly when ""Christ himself came down and took her"" in November 1938. In order to do justice to Weil's readings, Meaney not only traces her apologetic intentions and explains the manner in which she recasts familiar Christian concepts (thereby letting them come alive - something every good apologist should be able to do), but also situates them among standard approaches used by classicists today, thereby showing that her interpretations truly contribute something new.

Sepse Eskili është nga ata krijues që nuk i shkon secilës ditë.  Ai kërkon një gjendje shpirtërore të veçantë. Dhe kjo për arsyen e thjeshtë se ti e njeh atë qysh nga rinia e hershme, e ke bërë në shkollë, ke dëgjuar për të në emisionet e kulturës në TV etj., shkurt, nuk ke asnjë kureshtje për të, kështu që leximi i tij ose, më saktë, rileximi i tij përbën vetvetiu një “akt të zgjedhur”.  Në të vërtetë, fjalët “lexim” ose “rilexim” në këtë rast ngjajnë të pasakta. Shfletimi i librit të tij më tepër se lexim është një përsiatje, madje gjatë kohës së leximit do të ishte e natyrshme që më shumë se i hapur, libri të qëndronte i mbyllur. Por dihet se për një gjë të tillë duhet një gjendje e veçantë shpirtërore, e cila nuk krijohet lehtë dhe në çdo kohë.    Dhe në qoftë se ti e kupton se dita nuk është e përshtatshme, atëherë është mirë ta vësh përsëri në raft librin dhe të presësh një ditë tjetër. Këto janë disa shënime për Eskilin të hedhura në kohë të ndryshme. Prej mendimeve që zgjojnë, mund të gjykohet se sa të përshtatshme ose jo kanë qenë ditët kur ato janë shkruar.

In blunt, provocative and deeply personal terms, she unearths the troubling cornerstones of Islam as it is widely practised today: tribal insularity, deep-seated anti-Semitism and an uncritical acceptance of the Quran as the final, and therefore superior, manifesto of God ... Manji offers a practical vision of how Islam can undergo a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives Islam's lost tradition of independent thought. The recipient of death threats as well as heartfelt support from her co-religionists, Manji travels throughout the world with her challenge for both Muslims and non-Muslims: dare to ask questions - out loud""--Publisher's description on back cover.

They called her Ember, the child of their heart, born to surrogate parents who refused to yield her after birth.  Raised among the Quanoot Indians, Ember is as modern as those around her, a young woman struggling with a loneliness and yearning she does not yet understand.  Stronger than her classmates, imbued with the power to heal, Ember's soul resounds with the cries and whispers of a time she has never seen, and of a people who beckon her home.  Desperate to unravel the mystery of her birth, Ember embarks on a spellbinding journey to find the people who call to her in her dreams.  Guided by a shaman who has waited for her return, pursued by the man of science who brought her to life, Ember is drawn to a place where no one else can go--where her ancestors, the golden-skinned people of her dreams, wait for her to set them free....

Instead she found terror and murder...  Isolated in the Gilmartin ancestral home in Herondale, Deborah and young Carreen were left to face a nameless, unseen danger lurking in the frozen village, where only the flick of a curtain at a window or some random footprints in the snow, showed that it was inhabited at all.  Alone in a house that had known violence, Deborah turned to Carreen's cousin Jeremy, as attractive as he was cynical and mysterious. But was he really a friend, or was he the enemy? In spite of Jeremy - or because of him? - Deborah found herself fighting for her life in an affair so bizarre as to shatter the silence of Herondale forever.

Discussing a diverse range of authors, including Margaret Fuller and Pauline Hopkins, Beam traces this style through a variety of literary endeavors and reconstructs the political rationale behind the writers' commitments to this form of prose. Beam provides both close readings of a number of familiar and unfamiliar works and an overarching account of the importance of this form of writing, suggesting new ways of looking at how gender determines literary style. Style, Gender, and Fantasy in Nineteenth Century American Women's Writing redefines our understanding of women's relation to aesthetics and their contribution to both American literary romanticism and feminist reform. This illuminating account provides valuable new insights for scholars of American literature and women's writing""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet censorship and the suppression of literature never cease, and remain topical issues even in the most liberal of democracies. Today just as in the past, advances in media technology are followed by new regulatory mechanisms. Similarly, any attempt to control cultural expression inevitably spurs fresh discussions about freedom of speech.    In Forbidden Literature scholars from a variety of disciplines address censorship’s past and present, whether in liberal democracies or totalitarian regimes. Through in-depth case studies they trace a historical continuum in which literature reveals its two-sided nature: it demands both regulation and protection. The contributors investigate the logic of literary repression, particularly in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and analyse why it is thought essential to control literature. Moreover, the authors determine how literary practices are shaped and transformed by regulation and censorship.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

That conference, also entitled Reception and the Classics, sought to define and articulate the particular role of Classics and classicists in the project of Reception Studies.1 The field of Reception Studies ranges over a vast stretch of time and material, from classical antiquity to the present day, from literature to art, music, and film; it is thus an inherently interdisciplinary field in its encompassing of a great variety of departments and disciplines, each with its own canons, practices, and shared working assumptions. This interdisciplinary practice has formed the intellectual foundation for the present collection: although Reception Studies as a field has grown in scope and energy between conference and publication, we feel that the question of where Classics stands in relation to its peer disciplines remains alive and crucial""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Herman Melville,Hershel Parker,literature,First published in 1996,/works/OL3269259W?edition=ia%3Ahermanmelville00hers,/authors/OL533304A/Hershel_Parker,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7870843M-M.jpg,"Publish Date May 8, 2002|Publisher  The Johns Hopkins University Press|Language English|Pages 1056","Volume 1 summary: Having left most of Moby-Dick with a printer in 1851, Herman Melville lamented to Nathaniel Hawthorne that he would go down in history as a ""man who lived among the cannibals!"" Until his death in 1891, Melville was known as the author of Typee (1846) and Omoo (1847) -- both semiautobiographical travel books, and literary sensations because of Melville's sensual description of the South Sea islanders. (A transatlantic furor raged over whether the books were fact or fiction.) His most famous character was Fayaway -- not Captain Ahab, not the White Whale, not Bartleby, and definitely not Billy Budd, whose story remained unpublished until 1924. Herman Melville: Volume 1, 1819-1851 is the first of a two-volume project constituting the fullest biography of Melville ever published. Hershel Parker, co-editor of the Northwestern-Newberry Edition of The Writings of Herman Melville, reveals with extraordinary precision the twisted turmoil of Melville's life, beginning with his Manhattan boyhood where, surrounded by tokens of heroic ancestors, he witnessed his father's dissipation of two family fortunes. Having attended the best Manhattan boys' schools, Herman was withdrawn from classes at the Albany Academy at age 12, shortly after his father's death. Outwardly docile, inwardly rebellious, he worked where his family put him -- in a bank, in his brother's fur store -- until, at age 21, he escaped his responsibilities to his impoverished mother and his six siblings and sailed to the Pacific as a whaleman. A year and a half after his return, Melville was a famous author, thanks to the efforts of his older brother in finding publishers. Three years later he was married, the man of the family, a New Yorker -- and still not equipped to do the responsible thing: write more books in the vein that had proven so popular. After the disappointing failure of Mardi, which he had hoped would prove him a literary genius, Melville wrote two more saleable books in four months -- Redburn and White-Jacket. Early in 1850 he began work on Moby-Dick. Moving to a farmhouse in the Berkshires, he finished the book with majestic companions -- Hawthorne a few miles to the south, and Mount Greylock looming to the north. Before he completed the book he made the most reckless gamble of his life, borrowing left and right (like his wastrel patrician father), sure that a book so great would outsell even Typee. Melville lovers have known Hershel Parker as a newsbringer -- from the shocking false report headlined ""Herman Melville Crazy"" to the tantalizing title of Melville's lost novel, The Isle of the Cross. Carrying on the late Jay Leyda's The Melville Log, Parker in the last decade has transcribed thousands of new documents into what will be published as the multi-volume Leyda-Parker The New Melville Log. Now, exploring the psychological narrative implicit in that mass of documents, Parker recreates episode after episode that will prove stunningly new, even to Melvilleans. - Publisher.  Volume 2 summary: The first volume of Hershel Parker's definitive biography of Herman Melville -- a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize -- closed on a mid-November day in 1851. In the dining room of the Little Red Inn in Lenox, Massachusetts, Melville had just presented an inscribed copy of his new novel, Moby-Dick, to his intimate friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, the man to whom the work was dedicated. ""Take it all in all,"" Parker concluded, ""this was the happiest day of Melville's life."" Herman Melville: A Biography, Volume 2, 1851-1891 chronicles Melville's life in rich detail, from this ecstatic moment to his death, in obscurity, forty years later. Parker describes the malignity of reviewers and sheer bad luck that doomed Moby-Dick to failure (and its author to prolonged indebtedness), the savage reviews he received for his next book Pierre, and his inability to have the novel The Isle of the Cross -- now lost -- published at all. Melville turned to magazine fiction, writing the now-classic ""Bartleby"" and ""Benito Cereno,"" and produced a final novel, The Confidence Man, a mordant satire of American optimism. Over his last three decades, while working as a customs inspector in Manhattan, Melville painstakingly remade himself as a poet, crafting the centennial epic Clarel, in which he sorted out his complex feelings for Hawthorne, and the masterful story ""Billy Budd,"" originally written as a prose headnote to an unfinished poem. Through prodigious archival research into hundreds of family letters and diary entries, newly discovered newspaper articles, and marginalia from books that Melville owned, Parker vividly recreates the last four decades of Melville's life, episode after episode unknown to previous biographers. The concluding volume of Herman Melville: A Biography confirms Hershel Parker's position as the world's leading Melville scholar, demonstrating his unrivaled biographical, literary, and historical imagination and providing a rich new portrait of a great and profoundly American artist. - Publisher.

These are worlds undreamt-of by any other mind.  Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father's desperate loneliness by way of his son's daydreaming through a teacher's homicidal breakdown (""The Soul Is Not a Smithy"").  Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way (""The Suffering Channel"").  Or capture the ache of love's breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring (""Oblivion"").  Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.  Oblivion is an arresting and hilarious creation from a writer ""whose best work challenges and reinvents the art of fiction"" (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

Mormonism,Bruce Kinney,literature,First published in 1912,/works/OL7726686W?edition=ia%3Amormonismislamof00kinnrich,/authors/OL2391737A/Bruce_Kinney,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7221709M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1912|Publisher  Fleming H. Revell Company,"The title of this, the latest of the textbooks issued by the Council of Women for Home Missions, may need a word of explanation. It is generally acknowledged that Mormonism is similar to Mohammedanism in its endorsement of the practice of polygamy, and its ideas of heaven. Many other points of similarity between these systems have been noted by students, and the Book of Mormon has marked resemblance to the Koran. As all ancient religions have a modern equivalent, Mormonism can justly be claimed to be the modern form of Mohammedanism, and not incorrectly termed ""the Islam of America."" While the subject considered in this book should be approached only in a spirit of fairness and Christian sympathy, it has become of too great importance in our national life to be omitted as a topic for careful study. It is in response to a wide-spread realization that this subject is a national problem, and bears an important relation to Home Missions, that the Council of Women presents this book. In beginning its study, it is wise to free the mind of some misapprehension. Prominent among our national ideals are those of religious liberty for ourselves, and toleration for our neighbors' faith. No violation of this principle is involved in a candid, just and sympathetic study of any system of religious belief. In the Handbook of our faith Christians are exhorted to prove all doctrines in order rightly to measure their truth and test their moral standards. In this spirit this textbook has been written. Dr. Kinney is peculiarly fitted to deal with his subject, both from careful investigation, and from personal acquaintance with it in Utah. The Mormon problem is not primarily a religious one, nor should it be so considered. The hierarchy which embodies this system has extended its influence into so many lines of our national concerns, that Mormonism has ceased to be of merely theological or religious significance. It must be studied in its relation to government and commerce; to social conditions; to its influence on state policies and even on the utterances of the press, before it can be rightly understood as a factor in our present-day nationality. In all these connections it is presented by Dr. Kinney, and while he regards with Christian sympathy the followers of the Mormon religion, he sees, and presents clearly, the dangers inherent in the designs, ambitions and methods of the all-powerful hierarchy, which absolutely controls the affairs of the church and the lives of every one of its members. The undue influence in the affairs of the nation and the councils of the government attained by this powerful body makes its beliefs and practices of national concern. Dr. Kinney's point of view is intelligent, broad, and just. The Council of Women for Home Missions is glad to give to its readers and students a textbook so full of carefully authenticated information, and written in a spirit of such justice and charity for those deceived, indeed, but honest in their mistaken beliefs. - From the Editorial Committee.

Fourteen-year-old Allie is whisked away to the north, to a rainforested valley, by Julia, an aunt she barely knows.

And she watches her mother's first love who she discovers still lives in the valley. As the intoxicating heat of the wet season builds, Allie tries to decipher the truth and lies that her mother has told her, and must come to grips with the many secrets held close in the valley.Beautifully written, Salt Rain is an extraordinary evocation of the moods of the inexorable rainforest, of families and of the secrets hidden within them.

Dr Hesk traces the ways in which Athenian drama, democratic oratory and elite prose writing construct and theorise a relationship between dishonesty and civic identity. He focuses on the ideology of military trickery, notions of the 'noble lie' and the developing associations of rhetorical language with deceptive communication. Deception and Democracy in Classical Athens combines close analysis of Athenian texts with lively critiques of modern theorists and classical scholars. Athenian democratic culture was crucially informed by a nuanced, anxious and dynamic discourse on the problems and opportunities which deception presented for its citizenry. Mobilising comparisons with twentieth-century democracies, the author argues that Athenian literature made deception a fundamental concern for democratic citizenship. This ancient discourse on lying highlights the dangers of modern resignation and postmodern complacency concerning the politics and morality of deception.

Louisa Jardine is the older one, the conscientious student, precise and careful: the one who years for a good marriage, an artistic career, a family. Clem, the archetypal youngest, is the rebel: uncontainable, iconoclastic, committed to her work but not to the men who fall for her daring nature. Louisa resents that the charismatic Clem has always been the favorite; yet as Clem puts it, ""On the other side of the fence--mine--every expectation you fulfill . . . puts you one stop closer to that Grand Canyon rim from which you could one day rule the world--or plummet in very grand style."" In this vivid, heartrending story of what we can and cannot do for those we love, the sisters grow closer as they move farther apart. Louis settles in New York while Clem, a wildlife biologist, moves restlessly about until she lands in the Rocky Mountains. Their complex bond, Louisa observes, is ""like a double helix, two souls coiling around a common axis, joined yet never touching.""Alive with all the sensual detail and riveting characterization that mark Glass's previous work, I See You Everywhere is a piercingly candid story of life and death, companionship and sorrow, and the nature of sisterhood itself.From the Hardcover edition.

When the Hortons return home, Miriam’s confusion only grows as she discovers she might have the power to heal—even though her father and the church have always made it clear that such power is denied to women. Over the course of the next year, Miriam must decide between her faith, her family, and her newfound power that might be able to save others, but, if discovered by her father, could destroy Miriam.

He was troubled, in truth his heart lay very heavy within him. He was thinking over the terrible news that had come so swiftly, as evil report has a way of doing. But he had cause for satisfaction, too, and recalling it, he turned to gaze once more upon the two lads who, escaping so many perils, had arrived at the shelter of his home.      Robert and Tayoga were thin and worn, their clothing was soiled and torn, but youth was youth and they were forgetting dangers past in a splendid dinner that the fat Caterina was serving for them while Mynheer Jacobus, her master, stood by and saw the good deed well done.      The dining room, large and furnished solidly, was wonderful in its neatness and comfort. The heavy mahogany of table, sideboard and chairs was polished and gleaming. No trace of dirt was allowed to linger anywhere. When the door to the adjoining kitchen opened, as Caterina passed through, pleasant odors floated in, inciting the two to fresh efforts at the trencher. It was all as it had been when they were young boys living there, attending the school of Alexander McLean and traveling by painful steps along the road to knowledge.

Maus argues in this volume that Whitehead's first six books are linked by a careful balance between adherence to and violation of the wisdom of past generations. Whitehead bids readers to come along with him on challenging, often open-ended literary excursions designed to reexamine accepted notions of truth. Understanding Colson Whitehead unravels the parallel structures found within Whitehead's fiction from his 1999 novel The Intuitionist through 2011's Zone One. In his choice of literary forms, Whitehead attempts to revitalize the limiting formulas to which they have been reduced by first imitating and then violating the conventions of those genres and sub-genres. Whitehead similarly tests subject matter, again imitating and then satirizing various forms of conventional wisdom as a means of calling out unexamined, ignored, and/or malevolent aspects of American culture. Although only one of many subjects that Whitehead addresses, race often takes a place of centrality in his works and, as such, serves as the prime example of how Whitehead asks his readers to revisit their assumptions about meanings and values. By jumbling the literary formulas of the detective novel, the heroic folktale, the coming-of-age story, and the zombie apocalypse, Whitehead reveals the flaws and shortcomings of many of the long-lasting stories through which Americans have defined themselves. Some of the stories Whitehead focuses on are explicitly literary in nature, but he more frequently directs his attention toward the historical and cultural processes that influence how race, class, gender, education, social status, and other categories of identity determine what an individual supposedly can and cannot do.

He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all. No, he'll barely even speak to me.  But he still won't leave me alone.  We were best friends once. Then he turned on me and made it his mission to ruin my life. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to stay out of his way. I even went to France for a year, just to avoid him.  But I'm done hiding from him now, and there's no way in hell I'll allow him to ruin my senior year. He might not have changed, but I have. It's time to fight back.  I'm not going to let him bully me anymore.  *This novel contains adult/mature young adult situations. It is only suitable for ages 18+ due to language, violence, and sexual situations.

In 1975 the largest captive herd of giraffes in the world was slaughtered in the zoo of a small Czechoslovakian town, a massacre that has never been explained. Exploring this mystery, Giraffe is a story, at once vivid and unearthly, of creatures that are alien and silent, of the inhabitants of a totalitarian state, sleepwalking through the ""Communist moment,"" and of captivity and destruction of many kinds.

They know they are different to 'normal' girls but their attempts to find out what being an ordinary teenager are like - buying nice clothes instead of wearing Mum's odd hand-made garments, reading teenage magazines etc - are greeted with fury by their Dad. But when Dad has a stroke and ends up in hospital, unable to move or speak, Prue suddenly discovers what it's like to have a little freedom. Unable to cope with their education and a sick husband, the girls' mother sends them to the local comprehensive and they experience school life for the first time. Prue had never thought it would be so bitchy and that she'd find it so hard to fit in. The only person she can talk to is her kindly, young, handsome Art teacher, Rax. She and Rax bond over art lessons, and soon he asks to babysit for his young children while he and his wife have a night out on a Friday. This becomes a regular 'date' and Prue can't wait for the ten minutes they have along together as he drives her home. As her feelings for Rax develop, she begins to realise that perhaps he feels the same way about her. But he can't act upon them, can he?

Problem fathers in Shakespeare and Renaissance drama,Tom MacFaul,literature,First published in 2012,/works/OL16600115W,/authors/OL5238381A/Tom_MacFaul,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""Fathers are central to the drama of Shakespeare's time: they are revered, even sacred, yet they are also flawed human beings who feature as obstacles in plays of all genres. In Problem Fathers in Shakespeare and Renaissance Drama, Tom MacFaul examines how fathers are paradoxical and almost anomalous characters on the English Renaissance stage. Starting as figures of confident authority in early Elizabethan drama, their scope for action becomes gradually more restricted, until by late Jacobean drama they have accepted the limitations of their power. MacFaul argues that this process points towards a crisis of patriarchal authority in wider contemporary culture. While Shakespeare's plays provide a key insight into these shifts, this book explores the dramatic culture of the period more widely to present the ways in which Shakespeare's work differed from that of his contemporaries while both sharing and informing their artistic and ideological preoccupations""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But one unexpected danger she is unable to guard against is love. Decades later, when Fate intervenes, and Jud and Cale meet the beautiful and spirited Laurel, these two families cross paths once again – with terrible consequences...Spanning thirty years and three generations, The Days of Summer explores our deepest ties to family, and the sacrifices we make in the pursuit of love.

In the years that follow, Aaron and his second wife care for Madeline with deep tenderness and devotion as they raise two children of their own.Narrated by Aaron's son, Mac, When Madeline Was Young chronicles the Maciver family through the decades, from Mac's childhood growing up with Madeline and his cousin Buddy in Wisconsin through the Vietnam War, through Mac's years as a husband with children of his own, and through Buddy's involvement with the subsequent Gulf Wars. Jane Hamilton, with her usual humor and keen observations of human relationships, deftly explores the Maciver's unusual situation and examines notions of childhood (through Mac and Buddy's actual youth as well as Madeline's infantilization) and a rivalry between Buddy's and Mac's families that spans decades and various wars. She captures the pleasures and frustrations of marriage and family, and she exposes the role that past relationships, rivalries, and regrets inevitably play in the lives of adults. Inspired in part by Elizabeth Spencer's Light in the Piazza, Hamilton offers an honest and exquisite portrait of how a family tragedy forever shapes and alters the boundaries of love.

In this debut novel of astonishing originality, we bear witness to a family ravaged with regret at the loss of their child.As a young boy, the narrator learns that his parents lost their firstborn son while fleeing the advancing Russian Army in 1945. Though his family has comfortably settled in Westphalen, the memory of Arnold continues to haunt them. The narrator shares his parents' anguish, but he can't resist feeling resentful, for his brother's absence is the most defining aspect of his life. When his parents learn of a foundling that resembles Arnold, they embark on a horrific quest to claim him as their own, only to endure a series of unanticipated twists that lead to a startling denouement. At turns uncanny, subtle, and perversely amusing, Lost is a chilling novel of mesmerizing power.From the Trade Paperback edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We first meet Aziz Arkoun as a 24-year-old stowaway--frozen, hungry, his perceptions jammed by a language he can't understand or speak. After 52 days in the hold of a tanker from Algeria, he jumps into the icy waters of Boston harbor and swims to shore. Seemingly rescued from isolation by Algerians he knew as a child, he instead finds himself in a world of disillusionment, duplicity, and stolen identities, living a raw comedy of daily survival not unlike what he fled back home.  As the story of Aziz and his friends unfolds--moving from the hardscrabble neighborhoods of East Boston and Brooklyn to a North African army camp--Harbor makes vivid the ambiguities of these men's past and present lives: burying a murdered girl in the Sahara; reading medieval Persian poetry on a bus, passing for Mexican; shoplifting Versace for clubbing, succumbing to sex in a public library; impersonating a double agent. But when Aziz begins to suspect that he and his friends are under surveillance, all assumptions--his and ours--dissolve in an urgent, mesmerizing complexity. And as Harbor races to its explosive conclusion, it compels us to question the questions it raises: Who are the terrorists? Can we recognize them? How do they live? A debut novel as evocative as it is convincing--a groundbreaking work that announces a fearless new voice in American fiction.From the Hardcover edition.

However, not only is secularism now under renewed attack from religious fundamentalism, but it has also been widely claimed that the scientific evidence itself points strongly to a universe deliberately fine-tuned for life to evolve in it. In addition, certain aspects of human life, like consciousness and the ability to recognise the existence of universal moral standards, seem completely resistant to evolutionary explanation. In this book Colin Howson analyses in detail the evidence which is claimed to support belief in God's existence and argues that the claim is not well-founded. Moreover, there is very compelling evidence that an all-powerful, all-knowing God not only does not exist but cannot exist, a conclusion both surprising and provocative""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

So when the brutally beaten body of a young woman is found, his attention focuses closely on the ex-boyfriend. But then more bodies start appearing, all beaten beyond recognition, and there is no connection between any of the victims. Because this is a new type of killer, one who revels in chaos. To survive, Hicks must face not only a serial killer with no discernable motive, but the hidden darkness of his own past.  ""A series of brutal murders intersect with a detective's troubled past in an unnamed British city. When Detective Andy Hicks examines the faceless corpse of Vicki Gibson, he clings to his philosophy that every murder has an explanation, even something as senseless as beating a young woman to death with a hammer. The similar murder of a homeless man further tests Hicks' belief and distances him from his pregnant wife, Rachel. She knows he doesn't want their baby, but Hicks can't tell her why. After more bludgeoned bodies appear, a pattern emerges that includes isolated locations, easy prey and a killer dressed in black who sends a letter to Hicks, taunting him that even he won't be able to crack the code the killer has generated. Worse still is evidence of a murder in progress that Hicks is helpless to prevent. When the killer attacks someone from one of Hicks' earliest cases, the detective is forced to confront his most painful memories as he frantically studies the murderous pattern for the one element that doesn't fit.""--Kirkus Reviews.

Focusing on contemporary Spanish authors Ana María Matute (1926–2014), Rosa Montero (1952–), and Lucía Etxebarria (1966–), the author examines how Spanish women writers are marketed in Spain and, in particular, how current marketing strategies reinforce traditional structures of femininity. Through an analysis of their work and lives in the context of the Franco Regime, the Transition to democracy and contemporary Spain, this book provides an innovative study of the construction of the public personae of these key female writers. As social media and the internet transform authors’ relationship with their readers, the rapidly shifting publishing industry offers an important context for the difficult balance between high levels of reception and visibility and the persistence of traditional gender stereotypes.

Rowan Boyson reminds us that philosophers of the Enlightenment, unlike modern thinkers, often represented pleasure as shared rather than selfish, and she focuses particularly on this approach to the philosophy and theory of pleasure. Through close reading of Enlightenment and Romantic texts, in particular the poetry and prose of William Wordsworth, Boyson elaborates on this central theme. Covering a wide range of texts by philosophers, theorists and creative writers from over the centuries, she presents a strong defence of the Enlightenment ideal of pleasure, drawing out its rich political, as well as intellectual and aesthetic, implications""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He strikes up a conversation with a solitary diner at the next table, who leaves soon afterward. With horrifying speed, this chance encounter leads to a series of malign accidents, through which Adam loses everything—home, family, friends, job, reputation, passport, credit cards, cell phone—never to get them back.The police are searching for him. There is a reward for his capture. A hired killer is stalking him. He is alone and anonymous in a huge, pitiless modern city. Adam has nowhere to go but down—underground. He decides to join that vast army of the disappeared and the missing who throng London's lowest levels as he tries to figure out what to do with his life and struggles to understand the forces that have made it unravel so spectacularly. Adam's quest will take him all along the river Thames, from affluent Chelsea to the gritty East End, and on the way he will encounter all manner of London's denizens—aristocrats, prostitutes, evangelists, and policewomen—and version after new version of himself.Ordinary Thunderstorms, William Boyd's electric follow-up to his award-winning Restless, is a profound and gripping novel about the fragility of social identity, the corruption at the heart of big business, and the secrets that lie hidden in the filthy underbelly of every city.

L'accueil favorable que cet ouvrage a recu du public, m'a engage a le revoir avec attention. Mon but principal a ete d'en rendre la lecture plus facile. Je ne me flatte pas d'avoir epargne tout travail au lecteur ; mais je crois qu'avec de l'attention, on pourra suivre, sans beaucoup de peine, toute la chaine des idees et des raisonnemens. C'est dans cette meme vue que j'ai ajoute deux tables de l'ouvrage : l'une analytique, dressee avec beaucoup de soin par mon collegue, M De Tracy ; l'autre alphabetique, que je dois au zele complaisant de mon laborieux et savant confrere, M Sue, professeur et bibliothecaire a l'ecole de medecine de Paris. Les corrections que j'ai faites, portent, en general, plutot sur la redaction que sur le fond meme des idees. Je n'ai pas cru devoir changer la forme de memoires, sous laquelle l'ouvrage a paru d'abord : elle me semble caracteriser l'epoque de sa composition et de sa premiere publication. J'ai cru bien moins encore devoir ceder a l'avis qui m'a ete donne, de reunir dans un seul memoire, ce que j'ai dit dans le second, le troisieme et le dixieme, sur les premieres determinations vitales, sur l'instinct, la sympathie, etc. Si j'avais place dans le second et le troisieme, ce que le dixieme renferme sur les memes sujets, il m'eut ete absolument impossible de me faire entendre ; toutes ces idees ayant besoin d'etre preparees d'avance par les memoires intermediaires : et si j'avais reserve pour le dixieme ce qui se trouve dans le second et dans le troisieme, j'aurais ecarte de ceux-ci des choses necessaires a l'intelligence facile des suivans. Il me semble que, dans tout l'ouvrage, les idees sont rangees suivant leur ordre naturel, et qu'on ne pourrait changer cet ordre, sans beaucoup nuire a leur enchainement et a leur clarte.

But Marina—twenty-one, newly graduated, and close to her mom in many ways—has always been more the PBS type: dependable, practical, and completely in control. Elizabeth knows Marina wants to avoid the kind of “stupid mistake” that left Elizabeth a single mother at twenty-two, and she’s bitten her tongue as Marina settles for a wealthy fiance who gives her everything she thinks she wants. After all, Elizabeth¬—unable to bring herself to fully commit to the man she has dated for years—is hardly an expert in romance.  Still, a lot can happen on vacation, especially in Tuscany, where every scent borne on the warm breeze inspires delight, and every view makes the heart soar. There, on streets once walked by Dante and Michaelangelo, Marina is blindsided by a gorgeous Italian named Luca who shows her how gloriously unpredictable passion can be, and Elizabeth finally lets go of the role that has defined her for so long to embrace her own uncertain future…   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Behind the camera, however, existed a hauntingly beautiful, enigmatic, eccentric woman of multiple talents and limitless imagination whose personal life resembled a tragic fairy tale. Separated from her beloved brother as a child, forced into isolation and instability by her possessive mother, losing her dashing fiance on the eve of their wedding, Dare turned to her childhood toys to create a miniature world of fearless princesses, compassionate dolls, and mischievous animals. But Dare's own happy ending would not be so simple.   Read more Read less",10 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Protagonist Paul Harris, a homosexual soldier fated to marry the fiancee of his dead brother through loyalty, is a deeply tender character drifting into a world he cannot love. Forced to hide his true desires for his sometime lover and former sergeant, Adam, now a butcher, the difficulties that one can only imagine were faced in the post war period by ex-soldiers are laid out sensitively. By no means a 'fully wronged' man, Paul, like the other characters, has his emotional and physical frailties, and rather than force any one point of view on her reader, Marion Husband calmly portrays a balanced narrative allowing the readers to make up their own minds. Through the vivid flashbacks the author highlights the contrasts between events lived and living, and in the sweat, tears and anger of war the same passions rumble with a whole different form of expression. Allowing the characters to develop in effortless prose with a series of graphic sex scenes and realistic dialect, 'the love that dare not speak its name' is explored with true feeling and passionate lust.

The two Latin cultures and the foundation of Renaissance humanism in medieval Italy,Ronald G.

Covering a period of over four and a half centuries, this study offers the first integrated analysis of Latin writings produced in the area, examining not only religious, literary, and legal texts. Ronald G. Witt characterizes the changes reflected in these Latin writings as products of the interaction of thought with economic, political, and religious tendencies in Italian society as well as with intellectual influences coming from abroad. His research ultimately traces the early emergence of humanism in northern Italy in the mid-thirteenth century to the precocious development of a lay intelligentsia in the region, whose participation in the culture of Latin writing fostered the beginnings of the intellectual movement which would eventually revolutionize all of Europe""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Anatomy of Restlessness: Selected Writings 1969-1989,Bruce Chatwin,literature,First published in 1996,/works/OL612493W?edition=ia%3Aanatomyofrestles00chat,/authors/OL47322A/Bruce_Chatwin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL966608M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Viking|Language English|Pages 205,"It is commonly supposed that Bruce Chatwin was an ingenuous latecomer to the profession of letters, a misapprehension given apparent credence by that now famous passage in his lyrical, autobiographical ""I Always Wanted to Go to Patagonia,"" in which we are told that this indefatigable traveler's literary career began in midstride, almost on a whim, with a telegram announcing his departure for the farthest-flung corner of the globe: ""Have gone to Patagonia."".  Such a view overlooks the fact that from the late 1960s onward Chatwin was already fashioning the tools of his future trade in the columns of a variety of magazines and journals. And that he continued to do so through every twist and turn of his career, from art expert to archaeologist, to journalist and author, right up until his death in 1989. These previously neglected or unpublished pieces - short stories, travel sketches, essays, articles, and criticism - gathered together here for the first time, cover every period and aspect of the writer's career, and reflect the abiding themes of his work: roots and rootlessness, exile and the exotic, possession and renunciation.

Hence the pressing question facing contemporary democracies is how to privilege the performance of political fictions that promote peace and welfare rather than violence and poverty""--  ""This book proposes a revisionist approach to democratic politics. Yaron Ezrahi focuses on the creative unconscious collective imagination that generates ever-changing visions of legitimate power and authority, which compete for enactment and institutionalization in the political arena. If, in the past, political authority was grounded in fictions such as the divine right of kings, the laws of nature, historical determinism, and scientism, today the space of democratic politics is filled with multiple alternative social imaginaries of the desirable political order. Exposure to electronic mass media has made contemporary democratic publics more aware that credible popular fictions have greater impact on shaping our political realities than do rational social choices or moral arguments. The pressing political question in contemporary democracy is, therefore, how to select and enact political fictions that promote peace, not violence, and how to found the political order on checks and balances between alternative political imaginaries of freedom and justice""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Het is ook een hoogtepunt in het omvangrijke oeuvre van P.C. Hooftprijswinnaar J. Bernlef. Meer dan een boek over dementie is het een verhaal over het trage verval van een bewustzijn.  De hoofdpersoon van deze roman, Maarten Klein, is een klassiek personage geworden in de Nederlandse literatuur: als gepensioneerd secretaris van een maritieme organisatie, verhuisd naar Noord-Amerika, lijkt hij van een rustige oude dag te gaan genieten, tot er storingen in zijn brein optreden. Bij volle bewustzijn raakt Maarten afwezig, heeft het gevoel te verdwalen, kan heden en verleden niet meer onderscheiden, verliest zijn greep op de taal, wil plotseling weer naar zijn werk en ziet zijn vrouw voor zijn moeder aan. Maarten leidt kortom aan hersenschimmen.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|3 Have read

This was twenty years after the publication of his landmark poem ""Howl,"" and Jack Kerouac's seminal book On the Road. Through the creation of this course, which he ended up teaching five times, first at the Naropa Institute and later at Brooklyn College, Ginsberg saw an opportunity to make a record of the history of Beat Literature. Compiled and edited by renowned Beat scholar Bill Morgan, and with an introduction by Anne Waldman, The Best Minds of My Generation presents the lectures in edited form, complete with notes, and paints a portrait of the Beats as Ginsberg knew them: friends, confidantes, literary mentors, and fellow revolutionaries. Ginsberg was seminal to the creation of a public perception of Beat writers and knew all of the major figures personally, making him uniquely qualified to be the historian of the movement. In The Best Minds of My Generation, Ginsberg shares anecdotes of meeting Kerouac, Burroughs, and other writers for the first time, explains his own poetics, elucidates the importance of music to Beat writing, discusses visual influences and the cut-up method, and paints a portrait of a group who were leading a literary revolution. For academics and Beat neophytes alike, The Best Minds of My Generation is a personal and yet critical look at one of the most important literary movements of the twentieth century""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Sez Ner,Arno Camenisch,literature,First published in 2009,/works/OL15168263W,/authors/OL6811555A/Arno_Camenisch,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24279867M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Editura Universitară|Language Romanian|Pages 199,"Putine carti din literatura elvetiana - si poate chiar si din cea mondiala – s-au bucurat de un succes atat de rasunator, imediat dupa aparitie, ca volumul Sez Ner, tradus si de noi.  Cartea s-a vandut rapid in mii de exemplare, iar autorul a fost invitat sa-si prezinte volumul in peste o suta de locuri in tara lui si in strainatate. La ora actuala, Sez Ner este o carte tradusa in vreo zece limbi, iar autorul a primit nenumarate premii in Elvetia si peste granita, in tarile vecine. Arno Camenisch este unul dintre rarii scriitori care traiesc din scris. Editura romansa din orasul Chur (Cuera) a facut o editie auditiva pe sase discuri compacte  in lectura autorului, iar diferite teatre din Elvetia vor prezenta incepand din acest an o versiune dramatizata a cartii. Lucrarea lui Arno Camenisch s-a bucurat pana in prezent de peste 60 de recenzii in publicatii germane, romanse, franceze si italiene si de o prezentare in romana.  Ce vrea sa spuna titlul cartii? In centrul cunoscutei regiuni romanse Surselva, patria cea mica a scriitorului, se afla intr-adevar un munte de inaltime medie numit Sezner. Scriitorul a despartit numele propriu real intr-un nume literar Sez Ner care, in functie de cuvantul accentuat din sintagma, poate sa insemne fie „cel negru, el insusi negru (diavolul?)”, cu accentul pe sez, fie „scaunul negru” cu accentul pe ner. Fiind vorba de un nume propriu fara rezonanta si semnificatie in spatiul romanesc am preferat un titlu mai transparent in limba noastra: Muntele Sez Ner. Desi independenta aparent, cartea face parte dintr-o trilogie, din care anul trecut a aparut in germana si al doilea volum In spatele garii. Ambele scrieri se refera la ambianta copilariei autorului.  Mai multe motive, dupa opinia noastra, au contribuit la acest succes literar in Elvetia si in exteriorul ei. In primul rand faptul ca autorul insusi si-a scris opera in doua limbi, mai intai in una de circulatie (germana) si apoi a rescris-o in limba lui materna, mai putin raspandita, dar foarte adecvata subiectului (romansa), cunoscuta fiind bogatia lexicala a acesteia din urma in domeniul pastoritului. Comparand cele doua versiuni, realizam imbogatirea reciproca a celor doua idiomuri, unul pe seama celuilalt. Romansa accede la vocabularul tehnic al germanei, de exemplu, iar germana se imbogateste cu termeni specifici pastoritului din romansa. Cele doua versiuni nu sunt perfect egale, dar coincid in esenta lor. Autorul marturiseste ca a vrut sa combine „duritatea” limbii germane cu „muzicalitatea” romansei, un idiom caracterizat prin prezenta diftongilor si a cuvintelor terminate in vocala. De altfel, bilingvismul este propriu ariei geografice din care provine autorul, obisnuit cu sonoritatea celor doua idiomuri, diferite structural. Din punct de vedere lingvistic, cartea este o modalitate de adresare catre un cititor plurilingv, tipic tarii cantoanelor. Și daca initial ea a avut in vedere vorbitorii de germana si de romansa, prin traducerile ulterioare (in franceza si italiana) ea a devenit accesibila tuturor locuitorilor din cele patru zone lingvistice ale Elvetiei. Scriitorul este atent la evolutia idiomurilor cunoscute de el, cultivandu-le sonoritatile si ritmul, grija de conservare a romansei, profund germanizata in textul sau, neconstituind un scop in sine.   In al doilea rand, alegerea subiectului. Autorul a ales sa descrie o realitate dura, pe cale de disparitie, viata pastorilor  din Alpii sursilvani, asa cum a cunoscut-o  in copilarie, cand a fost el insusi de patru ori baiat la stana. Aceasta realitate n-are nimic romantic in sine, pastorii sufera, au mainile crapate, au picioarele ude, sunt confruntati cu bolile lor si cu bolile si moartea unor animale etc. Simplitatea mediului prezentat, viata de o vara langa vaci, porci, gaini, capre fascineaza cititorul modern al zilelor noastre, traitor intr-o lume de confort, si ii atrage curiozitatea. Asa se explica si faptul  ca multi tineri intelectuali se angajeaza ca pastori in Alpi si pentru noi, cei din est, mai ales prezenta fetelor (de obicei studente) este surprinzatoare. Un scriitor de marca din regiunea Surselvei, cu studii inalte, a fost ani de zile cioban la oi in platoul Greina. Civilizatia actuala, nociva in general pentru specia umana, reclama intoarcerea la natura, iar tineretul din tarile industrializate este sensibilizat in acest demers. Noua insa ne este ingaduita comparatia cu stanele noastre traditionale unde nu exista, in general, apa curenta, boiler, robinete, fosa ecologica etc., prezente in relatarea lui Arno Camenisch. Ocupat cu scrisul si cu prezentarea operei sale literare, autorului, traitor actualmente intr-un orasel din regiunea joasa a tarii cantoanelor, ii lipseste din cand  in cand posibilitatea de a se relaxa, atunci cand simte ca-i iese „fum” din cap, dupa expresia lui, practicand o munca dura, tipica muntenilor, taiatul lemnelor.  Nu este deloc de neglijat nici talentul interpretativ al lui Arno Camenisch la citirea fragmentelor din opera sa, caracterizata prin oralitate. Lectura lui este ritmica si captivanta. El stie unde sa-si punctueze textul, unde sa puna o pauza mai mare sau mai mica, unde sa intrerupa lectura cu o remarca. Este un fel de magician al cuvantului in doua limbi pe care le domina la perfectie. La asta se adauga, in afara talentului, si o cunoastere aprofundata a stiintei scrisului, dat fiind ca autorul este un proaspat absolvent al Institutului Literar Elvetian de la Biel / Bienne.   Multi recenzenti  denumesc aceasta opera literara roman. Pentru noi, este dificil sa o incadram  intr-un gen literar clasic. Autorul simuleaza mai curand o specie de reportaj artistic modern, compus din fragmente, adesea foarte scurte, dar cu talc, aparent disparate, cu scene si actiuni tipice mediului descris din care lipsesc insa comentariile autorului, plasat ca observator si nu ca participant. El cerceteaza cu lupa ambientul pastoresc dintr-o scurta vara alpina, marcata de urcarea turmelor la munte, la inceputul verii, si de coborarea lor, la sosirea toamnei, si prezinta acest mediu alpin intr-o succesiune de imagini, ca intr-un film documentar. Locul actiunii este un munte  din Surselva, regiunea natala a autorului, cu versantii, pasunile inalte si cele joase, izvoarele care servesc de adapatori pentru animale, drumurile prafuite, padurile inverzite si crucea de pe varf. Personajele principale sunt creionate si identificate prin numele ocupatiei lor: baciul, ajutorul sau, vacarul si porcarul. Ele n-au nume. Raporturile stabilite intre eroii principali ai povestirii sunt ierarhice si dure, dominate de autoritatea baciului. Personajele secundare, de obicei proprietarii de animale, sunt  individualizati  prin numele lor de botez. Nici pastoritei de la cireada vecina nu i se spune pe nume, ci pastorita de juninci. Turistii sunt rareori identificati (exista o Margrit care filmeaza), iar soldatii, care fac exercitii de lupta pe munte, sunt anonimi. Dintre animale doar vacile au nume, ne spune scriitorul: „Vacile au nume, porcii nu. Porcii sunt porci. Vacile poarta la ureche placute rotunde de aluminiu si cifre pe solduri. Pastorii cunosc vacile dupa nume. E mai familiar cand vacile au nume, spune vacarul porcarului seara, in spatele grajdului, cand vacile sunt pe pasunea de noapte si-i da tutun. Tutunul l-a luat Duminica de la un taran. Vaca nu-i numai vaca. Porcarul trage din tigara si zice ca el nu poate intelege pe taranii care spun ca ar avea cinci vaci, in loc sa spuna ca au pe Marta, pe Barla, pe Marlis, pe Nicki si pe Petra ...Parintele ar fi trebuit sa binecuvanteze fiecare vaca in parte dupa nume si nu numai la gramada si gata, zice vacarul cu mainile in buzunar.” Cainii si pisicile sunt identificati prin atribute: Tigratul, Cenusiul, Batranul. Capra, gainile si cocosul, ca si porcii, n-au nume, dar despre berbecul negru, desi e singurul din specia lui,  se spune adesea ca are o pata alba in frunte.  Și cu animalele pe care le ingrijesc cei patru eroi se poarta brutal, neezitand sa le bata in absenta proprietarilor. De altfel eroii se misca intr-un mic univers plin de contradictii, orizontul lor limitat fiind o combinatie de religie si paganism, de traditie si inovatie tehnica, de intelepciune populara si ignoranta.  Stilul scriitorului este marcat de oralitatea si muzicalitatea limbii. La prezentarea variantei italiene a lui Sez Ner la Bellinzona, in Ticino, Arno Camenisch declara intr-un interviu ca nu-l intereseaza conventiile narative. Nu exista semne de citare, linie de dialog, semnul intrebarii sau al exclamarii. Virgulele sunt folosite parcimonios. Dialogurile sunt nemarcate grafic, exista un joc al discursului direct cu cel indirect, reliefate prin prezenta verbelor dicendi sau numai din contextul lexical ori prin alternanta timpurilor si a modurilor verbale: „Berbecul s-a ingrasat de cand nu mai are ghipsul. O sa facem o masa mare, spune baciul cu sort alb fara sa ridice ochii si rasfoieste mai departe revista Blick pe care au lasat-o taranii Duminica trecuta. Iau cu mine berbecul, dupa ce trece vara, zice ajutorul de baci. El poate lua capra si, in ce-l priveste, si gainile, dar berbecul, nu. Baciul rasfoieste revista pana la capat si o pune pe marginea ferestrei, langa radioul cu antena rupta. La naiba cu blestemata asta de capra.”  Prin mijloace simple, dar alese cu grija, tanarul scriitor slefuieste ca pe o piatra textul sau scotand nestemate din noroi si aratand ca frumusetea si magia sunt de gasit pretutindeni, chiar si intr-o realitate dura. Pentru a accentua culoarea locala, scriitorul face apel la numeroase regionalisme, unele neconsemnate in dictionarele curente, si, cand simte nevoia, creeaza el insusi cuvinte noi. Munca lui de Sisif cu textul, marturiseste autorul intr-un interviu, se aseamana cu actiunea de demontare a omului de piatra si de refacere a lui intreprinsa de porcar: „Iarta-ma, zice porcarul, si incepe sa demonteze omul de piatra. Ia cu mana piatra dupa piatra, se uita si o intoarce pe toate partile, ca si cum ar fi vrut sa-i vada consistenta, pune pietrele deoparte, cele mari intr-o gramada, apoi cele mijlocii si cele mici, pana ce omul de piatra este demontat. Asa, zice el, ia o dala de piatra, trece cu mana peste ea si o pune in iarba, unde statuse omul de piatra. Ia apoi o piatra ascutita si graveaza un semn pe dala. Porcarul pune teanc pietrele pe dala, una cate una, cu grija, ca omul de piatra sa poata tine piept vremii proaste, pana ce acesta este refacut. ” (www.editurauniversitara.ro)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although T. R. Pearson's Neely, North Carolina, doesn't appear on any map of the state, it has already earned a secure place on the literary landscape of the South. In this introduction to Neely, the young narrator, Louis Benfield, recounts the tragic last days of Miss Myra Angelique Pettigrew, a local spinster and former town belle who, after years of total seclusion, returns flamboyantly to public view-with her pet monkey, Mr. Britches. Here is a teeming human comedy inhabited by some of the most eccentric and endearing characters ever encountered in literature.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

She has a close-knit family, an expensive home, and a satisfying career as a landscape designer. She also reads mystery novels all the time--yet she can't see what is happening right in front of her eyes, and is astonished when her husband, Frank, is arrested for accounting fraud at LinkAge, the huge telecommunications firm that employs him. ""How could anything that boring be illegal?"" she wonders. The scandal hits the press and threatens to drain the Foys' bank account, send Frank to prison, and tear their family apart.Frank claims that fudging the numbers is standard practice in today's go-go business atmosphere. Everyone does it, or would if he could. Americans love recklessness, he insists. They admire scalawags. Pat does too--at least in novels. And it's hard for Pat to imagine who has suffered from LinkAge's bankruptcy. So she decides to search out the victims, and finds more than she bargained for. At first she thinks that all she has to do to make amends is whip out her checkbook. What she doesn't know is that events have already begun to spin out of control, and that the future holds as many twists and turns as any of the whodunits she has read.Jacqueline Carey's whip-smart and irresistibly sly novel deftly portrays the dire costs of today's corporate culture of runaway greed--and brings to life a fractured landscape filled with CEOs-turned-robber barons, privileged lives punctured by wretched excess, and personal relationships put to the ultimate test.From the Hardcover edition.

There's Eleni, ripped from her husband and two young daughters and sent to Spinalonga in 1939, and her daughters Maria, finding joy in the everyday as she dutifully cares for her father, and Anna, a wild child hungry for passion and a life anywhere but Plaka. And finally there's Alexis, Eleni's great-granddaughter, visiting modern-day Greece to unlock her family's past.A richly enchanting novel of lives and loves unfolding against the backdrop of the Mediterranean during World War II, The Island is an enthralling story of dreams and desires, of secrets desperately hidden, and of leprosy's touch on an unforgettable family.

Kate Lyle is a headstrong young woman desperate to escape a sexually predatory household. Both are Anglo-Indians, members of a race that helped turn the wheels of Empire for years. But Empire days are numbered, and as India sheds its colonial skin, the young lovers must face their own tryst with destiny.In twenty-first-century England, Owen Monroe is writing this story of his parents' lives in an effort to avoid the problems in his own: lost love, relentless libido, dreams of death, and a world full of headlines he can't understand and doesn't want to. But keeping past and present apart isn't as easy as it seems, and before long Owen is deep in the one story he never wanted to tell....Epic in its scope yet never losing sight of the telling, gorgeous detail, The Bloodstone Papers is an extraordinarily rich and beautiful read that manages to ask the big questions without fuss and to accept that the big answers aren't always what we want to hear.

The chapters written by the famously masked Marcos originate in the mountains of Chiapas, Mexico. There, the fictional ""Subcomandante Marcos"" assigns Elias Contreras—an odd but charming mountain man—to travel to Mexico City in search of an elusive and hideous murderer named ""Morales."" The second story line, penned by Taibo, stars his famous series detective Hector Belascoaran Shayne. The two stories collide absurdly and dramatically in the urban sprawl of Mexico City . . .

Angelo Perino lives life on the bleeding edge of speed and success a race car driver of humble origins who dominates on and off the track. Loren Hardeman is the ruthless patriarch of an auto empire, fighting to keep his family from self-destructing under the weight of its own greed and decadence.  The two men, bound by their passionate vision as well as their charismatic power over women, come together to create the world's fastest, most advanced automobile, ""The Betsy"" named after Hardeman's great-granddaughter, who has captured Perino's heart. Their creation threatens to disrupt the industry, whose power brokers are determined to prevent it no matter the cost. This pits Hardeman's own grandson, the company's current CEO, against him, revealing the depths to which Hardeman went to build his empire including murder, incestuous adultery and organized crime. As the family feud escalates, Perino makes his move to conquer Hardeman's empire as well as his great-granddaughter.  When it was published, ''The Betsy'' spent 21 weeks on The New York Times best sellers list and inspired a film of the same name starring Laurence Olivier, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duvall and Katharine Ross.

So begins this rare, original story about the abiding strength that imagination, once ignited, can provide. As artillery echoes in the mountains, thirteen-year-old Matilda and her peers are riveted by the adventures of a young orphan named Pip in a city called London, a city whose contours soon become more real than their own blighted landscape. As Mr. Watts says, ""A person entranced by a book simply forgets to breathe."" Soon come the rest of the villagers, initially threatened, finally inspired to share tales of their own that bring alive the rich mythology of their past. But in a ravaged place where even children are forced to live by their wits and daily survival is the only objective, imagination can be a dangerous thing.From the Hardcover edition.

In the middle of a sweltering July heat wave that has no end in sight, California's Golden State Power and Light is on overload. An emergency brownout is already in effect. Then, GSP&L's newest and largest generator explodes.  With four people dead and a widespread loss of power, a fringe group takes responsibility. But for GSP&L vice president Nim Goldman and his family; his adversary, investigative reporter Nancy Molineaux; detective Harry London; and beautiful quadriplegic Karen Sloan, whose every breath depends on electric power, the terror is just beginning . . . A dramatic and timely story of the people and the events leading to a crisis, Overload presents a fascinating view of the little-known world of electric power production that is vital to contemporary life.

The struggle of that class toward definition and the striving to articulate its character is central to the novel and the stories it tells. Its novelty is found in a formlessness that nonetheless aspires to some idea of order and unity. Indeed, the energies of the early modern novel form can be discerned in its constant assertion of narratives that enact that search for completeness while also allowing for a kind of mourning for the security that older, traditional forms and stories allowed. Thus, novelists, then as now, revel in the possibilities that formal innovation permits while their characters find themselves forced to acknowledge the newness of their world and their experiences in that world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

There are 1.2 million human-size rabbits living in the UK. They can walk, talk, drive cars, and they like to read Voltaire, the result of an Inexplicable Anthropomorphizing Event fifty-five years before. A family of rabbits is about to move into Much Hemlock, a cozy little village in Middle England where life revolves around summer fetes, jam making, gossipy corner stores, and the oh-so-important Best Kept Village awards. No sooner have the rabbits arrived than the villagers decide they must depart, citing their propensity to burrow and breed, and their shameless levels of veganism. But Mrs Constance Rabbit is made of sterner stuff, and her and her family decide they are to stay. Unusually, their neighbors--longtime resident Peter Knox and his daughter, Pippa--decide to stand with them . . . and soon discover that you can be a friend to rabbits or humans, but not both. With a blossoming romance, acute cultural differences, enforced rehoming to a MegaWarren in Wales, and the full power of the ruling United Kingdom Anti-Rabbit Party against them, Peter and Pippa are about to question everything they had ever thought about their friends, their nation, and their species. An inimitable blend of satire, fantasy, and thriller, The Constant Rabbit is the latest dazzlingly original foray into Jasper Fforde's ever-astonishing creative genius""--   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|5 Have read

Strobel challenges them with questions like How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence exist for Jesus outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this remarkable book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction.

And at its heart are the life, death, and resurrection of an extraordinary marriage.A Recipe for Bees introduces a remarkable and engaging heroine whose quest for love and independence spans a lifetime. Augusta Olsen has attitude, a wicked funny bone, a generous and wayward heart, and the gift of second sight.When her mother dies, Augusta is bereft and without direction until she marries her first suitor, Karl, the shy son of a detestable old farmer. As a young woman with an eye for beauty who longs for affection, she finds life on their remote, rustic farm almost unbearable. When the local reverend offers the occasional afternoon relief from her cloistered existence, she accepts; when another man from the town shows interest, she feels herself drawn toward him. Eventually, she and Karl and their young daughter, Joy, move onto a farm of their own, and Augusta looks for new ways to assert her independence. It is not until she resurrects her mother's beekeeping equipment that sweet possibilities become evident. And as the strands of her life unexpectedly twist together, the indulgences of youth and the many delights and exasperations of old age are enchantingly revealed.From the Hardcover edition.

Greg Forter interprets modernism as an effort to mourn a form of white manhood that fused the 'masculine' with the 'feminine'. He argues that modernists were engaged in a poignant yet deeply conflicted effort to hold on to socially 'feminine' and racially marked aspects of identity, qualities that the new social order encouraged them to disparage. Examining works by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and Willa Cather, Forter shows how these writers shared an ambivalence toward the feminine and an unease over existing racial categories that made it difficult for them to work through the loss of the masculinity they mourned. Gender, Race, and Mourning in American Modernism offers a bold new reading of canonical modernism in the United States""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

W. Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 256,"Composed toward the end of the first millennium, Beowulf is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of Beowulf, a Scandinavian hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and, later, from Grendel's mother. He then returns to his own country and dies in old age in a vivid fight against a dragon. The poem is about encountering the monstrous, defeating it, and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story, at once remote and uncannily familiar at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface. Drawn to what he has called the ""four-squareness of the utterance"" in Beowulf and its immense emotional credibility, Heaney gives these epic qualities new and convincing reality for the contemporary reader.

""Lost Girls is to erotic literature what Moore's now classic 1987 Watchmen (with Dave Gibbons) was to the superhero scene. Each busts the frames of its respective genre with formal precision; each reflects upon its own ways and means through books within the book; and, most importantly, each kicks great writing into hyperdrive with dense and resonant imagery. — The Village Voice  ""I think Lost Girls is not only one of the best things Alan Moore has ever written, I also think it’s a fairly important work of art judged by any standard. It's genuinely dangerous. … One of the most human and heartfelt pieces of work of his career."" — Ain't It Cool News  ""Intelligent writing, intricate plotlines and gorgeous Victorian-style art."" — USA Today  ""As thoughtful as it is provocative."" — Wired  ""As an exercise in the formal bounds of pure comics, Lost Girls is remarkable, as good as anything Moore has done in his career. ... Whatever you call it, there has never been anything quite like this in the world before, and I find myself extraordinarily pleased that someone of Moore's ability actually has written that sort of comics for adults."" — Neil Gaiman  The groundbreaking and controversial masterpiece of erotic comics, decades in the making, is now available in a sumptuous hardcover collecting all three volumes plus 32 pages of new artwork and commentary.  For more than a century, Alice, Wendy and Dorothy have been our guides through the Wonderland, Neverland and Land of Oz of our childhoods. Now like us, these three lost girls have grown up and are ready to guide us again, this time through the realms of our sexual awakening and fulfillment. Through their familiar fairytales they share with us their most intimate revelations of desire in its many forms, revelations that shine out radiantly through the dark clouds of war gathering around a luxury Austrian hotel. Drawing on the rich heritage of erotica, Lost Girls is the rediscovery of the power of ecstatic writing and art in a sublime union that only the medium of comics can achieve. Exquisite, thoughtful, and human, Lost Girls is a work of breathtaking scope that challenges the very notion of art fettered by convention. This is erotic fiction at its finest.

Yet the period from 1700 to 1840 produced some highly sophisticated psychological theorizing that became central to German intellectual and cultural life, well in advance of similar developments in the English-speaking world. Matthew Bell explores how this happened, by analysing the expressions of psychological theory in Goethe's Faust, Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and in the works of Lessing, Schiller, Kleist, and E. T. A. Hoffmann. This study pays special attention to the role of the German literary renaissance of the last third of the eighteenth century in bringing psychological theory into popular consciousness and shaping its transmission to the nineteenth century. All German texts are translated into English, making this fascinating area of European thought fully accessible to English readers for the first time.

When Mma Potokwane suggests to Mma Ramotswe that she run for a seat on the City Council, Mma Ramotswe is at first unsure. But when she learns about the proposed construction of the flashy Big Fun Hotel next to a graveyard, she allows herself to be persuaded. Her opponent is none other than Violet Sephotho, who is in the pocket of the hotel developers. Although Violet is intent on using every trick in the book to secure her election, Mma Ramotswe refuses to promise anything beyond what she can deliver--hence her slogan: ""I can't promise anything--but I shall do my best."" To everyone's surprise, she wins. As it turns out, politics does not agree with Mma Ramotswe. Though everyone is supportive, she eventually resigns.

Knopf|Pages 403,"This is one of those rare books that let us see with a fresh and startling clarity the underlying causes, meaning, and influence through time of profound a cultural phenomenon. In it, a brilliant young scholar traces the roots of our modern consumer culture to the sentimental society of Victorian America.  With originality and sympathetic wit, Ann Douglas explores the alliance, beginning in 1820, of two disenfranchised groups: the women of the middle class and the liberal Protestant clergy, both increasingly relegated to the edges of society (to the parlor, to the Sunday School, to the libraries) by the prevailing entrepreneurial forces.  Ann Douglas shows us the ladies and the ministers cultivating a realm of ""influence,"" becoming the cultural custodians, taking control of the schools, preaching a reverence for the very qualities that society imposed upon them: timidity, piety, childish naivete, a disdain for the competitive forces in the larger world. She gives us the missing social history of the Protestant minister in the Northeast, and the subtle decline of his inherited theology. She takes us through the magazines the women and the ministers edited (Ladies' Magazine, Godey's Lady's Book, The Ladies' Repository), through the etiquette books, into the saccharine biographies of ministers and the books about women that the ministers wrote (among them, Woman Suffrage: The Reform Against Nature) in which they tried to fix the correct ""feminine"" role or elaborate on woman's ""beautiful errand.""  She gives us the contemporary novels and tracts—lachrymose, narcissistic, riotously quirky, forgotten now but then wildly popular (The Empty Crib, Stepping Heavenward, as well as such scandalous books as Harriet Beecher Stowe's Lady Byron Vindicated). We see the authors, through their works, colonizing, even domesticating, heaven (heaven has houses, streets, pianos, food, and clothing), projecting the dead as a kind of consecrated leisure class in a celestial retirement village, conveying the impression that death widened their appointed sphere: the church, faith, manners, morals. . . . We see the prayer manuals and the flood of almost necrophiliac pamphlets that the Victorians devoured. . . . We see the women and the ministers competing for spiritual leadership in the community as they became more and more self-immersed.  We see vapidity masquerading as a sacred innocence, the moral life as a perpetual childhood, the church becoming progressively more anti-intellectual, the middle-class woman idealized not as doer but as n display case for the clothes and the pretty objects that man could lay at her feet, tragically contributing to her own exploitation, undermining all that was most authentic and creative in contemporary theology, romanticism, feminism. . . .  With a masterful grasp of the tentures and the tensions of Victorian life, Ann Douglas gives us, in counterpoint, the important work of the Romantics who were forced to exist without popular support—among them, Margaret Fuller, rejecting the feminine ideal propounded in the ladies' magazines, striking out to cultivate a sense of history, and a placesquarely within it, and Herman Melville, writing his vigorously anti-sentimental dramas of the sea and the city; both of them exalting the ideal of the singular self and soul that their culture increasingly disregarded.  This is a work of inspired scholarship and rich allusive power—an involving and fascinating portrait of Victorian America: its literature, its theology, its cultural legacy.—1977 jacket   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A Visit from the Goon Squad,Jennifer Egan,literature,First published in 2010,/works/OL15026613W?edition=ia%3Avisitfromgoonsqua00egan,/authors/OL451020A/Jennifer_Egan,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23872524M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Alfred A. Knopf|Language English,"Jennifer Egan's spellbinding interlocking narratives circle the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record executive, and Sasha, the passionate, troubled young woman he employs. Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other's pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa.  We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist's couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city's demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale.  We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life--divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house--and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco's punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang--who thrived and who faltered--and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie's catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou's far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall.  A Visit from the Goon Squad is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates. In a breathtaking array of styles and tones ranging from tragedy to satire to PowerPoint, Egan captures the undertow of self-destruction that we all must either master or succumb to; the basic human hunger for redemption; and the universal tendency to reach for both--and escape the merciless progress of time--in the transporting realms of art and music. Sly, startling, exhilarating work from one of our boldest writers. From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",90 Want to read|1 Currently reading|23 Have read

But even in a diverse art school, he’s seen as disruptive and unmotivated by a biased system. Then one fateful night, an altercation in a gentrifying neighborhood escalates into tragedy. “Boys just being boys” turns out to be true only when those boys are white.  The story that I think  will be my life  starts today  Suddenly, at just sixteen years old, Amal’s bright future is upended: he is convicted of a crime he didn’t commit and sent to prison. Despair and rage almost sink him until he turns to the refuge of his words, his art. This never should have been his story. But can he change it?  With spellbinding lyricism, award-winning author Ibi Zoboi and prison reform activist Yusef Salaam tell a moving and deeply profound story about how one boy is able to maintain his humanity and fight for the truth, in a system designed to strip him of both.    source: https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062996503/punching-the-air/   Read more Read less",16 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

In this book, the first dedicated to this topic, Paolo Crivelli discusses all the main aspects of Aristotle's views on truth and falsehood. He analyses in detail the main relevant passages, addresses some well-known problems of Aristotelian semantics, and assesses Aristotle's theory from the point of view of modern analytic philosophy. In the process he discusses most of the literature on Aristotle's semantic theory to have appeared in the last two centuries. His book vindicates and clarifies the often repeated claim that Aristotle's is a correspondence theory of truth. It will be of interest to a wide range of readers working in both ancient philosophy and modern philosophy of language.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A partir de entonces, esa niña desorientada y perpleja, que reza en silencio para volverse niño porque presiente que jamás conseguirá parecerse a su hermana melliza, Reina, la mujer perfecta, empieza a sospechar que no es la primera Fernández de Alcántara incapaz de encontrar el lugar adecuado en el mundo. Se propone entonces desenmarañar el laberinto de secretos que late bajo la apacible piel de su familia, una ejemplar familia burguesa madrileña. A la sombra de una vieja maldición, Malena aprende a mirarse, como en un espejo, en la memoria de quienes se creyeron malditos antes que ella y descubre, mientras alcanza la madurez, un reflejo de sus miedos y de su amor en la sucesión de mujeres imperfectas que la han precedido.

People who have survived a close brush with death reveal their extraordinary visions and ecstatic feelings at the moment they died, describing journeys through a tunnel to a realm of light, visual reviews of their past deeds, encounters with a benevolent spirit, and permanent transformation after returning to life. Carol Zaleski's Otherworld Journeys offers the most comprehensive treatment to date of the evidence surrounding near-death experiences. The first to place researchers' findings, first-person accounts, and possible medical or psychological explanations in historical perspective, she discusses how these materials reflect the influence of contemporary culture. She demonstrates that modern near-death reports belong to a vast family of otherworld journey tales, with examples in nearly every religious heritage. She identifies universal as well as culturally specific features by comparing near-death narratives in two distinct periods of Western society: medieval Christendom and twentieth-century secular America. This comparison reveals profound similarities, such as the life-review and the transforming after-effects of the vision, as well as striking contrasts, such as the absence of hell or punishment scenes from modern accounts. Mediating between the ""debunkers"" and the near-death researchers, Zaleski considers current efforts to explain near-death experience scientifically. She concludes by emphasizing the importance of the otherworld vision for understanding imaginative and religious experience in general.

This intense new novel follows a middle-aged man as he contends with a past he has never much thought about—until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance, one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony Webster thought he’d left all this behind as he built a life for himself, and by now his marriage and family and career have fallen into an amicable divorce and retirement. But he is then presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he’d understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.  A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single sitting, with stunning psychological and emotional depth and sophistication, The Sense of an Ending is a brilliant new chapter in Julian Barnes’s oeuvre.

The title Sister Outsider finds its source in her poetry collection The Black Unicorn (1978).

Wanderer, the invading 'soul' who has been given Melanie's body, knew about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the too-vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind. Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of the man Melanie loves - Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer yearns for a man she's never met. As outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off to search for the man they both love.   Read more Read less",84 Want to read|4 Currently reading|36 Have read

In A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, he shares a version of that class with us, offering some of what he and his students have discovered together over the years. Paired with iconic short stories by Chekhov, Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Gogol, the seven essays in this book are intended for anyone interested in how fiction works and why it’s more relevant than ever in these turbulent times.  In his introduction, Saunders writes, “We’re going to enter seven fastidiously constructed scale models of the world, made for a specific purpose that our time maybe doesn’t fully endorse but that these writers accepted implicitly as the aim of art—namely, to ask the big questions, questions like, How are we supposed to be living down here? What were we put here to accomplish? What should we value? What is truth, anyway, and how might we recognize it?” He approaches the stories technically yet accessibly, and through them explains how narrative functions; why we stay immersed in a story and why we resist it; and the bedrock virtues a writer must foster. The process of writing, Saunders reminds us, is a technical craft, but also a way of training oneself to see the world with new openness and curiosity.  A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is a deep exploration not just of how great writing works but of how the mind itself works while reading, and of how the reading and writing of stories make genuine connection possible.

He discloses serious errors in both the Old and New Testaments, and uses the Egyptian and other Fertile Crescent archives to show the true lineage of royal families, who, naturally, always have intermarried.    Gardner's works should be read alongside those of his late contemporary, Zecheriah Sitchin. Both scholars have, unfortunately, deceased this year past.

It tells the story of a transnational network of female scholars who were active members of the seventeenth-century republic of letters and demonstrates that this intellectual commonwealth was a much more eclectic and diverse assemblage than has been assumed. These seven scholars - Anna Maria van Schurman, Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Marie de Gournay, Marie du Moulin, Dorothy Moore, Bathsua Makin and Katherine Jones, Lady Ranelagh - were philosophers, schoolteachers, reformers and mathematicians. They hailed from England, Ireland, Germany, France and The Netherlands. And together with their male colleagues - men like Descartes, Huygens, Hartlib and Montaigne - they represented the spectrum of contemporary approaches to science, faith, politics and the advancement of learning. Carol Pal uses their collective biography to reconfigure the intellectual biography of early modern Europe, offering a new, expanded analysis of the seventeenth-century community of ideas""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Soon Stuart and Gillian are married, but it is not long before a tentative friendship between the three evolves into something far different.Talking it Over is a brilliant and intimate account of love's vicissitudes.

Plays which are discussed in detail include works by Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov, Wilde, and Beckett among others. The authors seek to show that the subtle understanding of conscious and unconscious emotions achieved by psychoanalytic practice can bring new ways of understanding classic works of drama. The argument of the book, set out in its introduction and exemplified in its discussion of individual dramatists and plays, is that western drama has represented the central tensions of societies as crises in the relationships of gender and generation, through dramatic explorations of the inner life of families. This is the common theme which links the book's analysis of Medea, Macbeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream amongst others. The value of this book lies in the originality of its analysis of individual plays, and the subtlety with which it brings psychoanalytic and sociological insights together. Mirror to Nature should be of particular relevance to those interested in the theatre, whether as theatregoers, performers or students, in psychoanalysis or psychotherapy, and in literature. Like the Rustins' earlier work on children's fiction, (Narratives of Love and Loss: Studies in Modern Children's Fiction) this volume on theatre shows a lucid and accessible way how psychoanalytic thinking can illuminate emotional experience in everyday life.

In The Pesthouse he imagines an America of the future where a man and a woman trek across a devastated and dangerous landscape, finding strength in each other and an unexpected love.Once the safest, most prosperous place on earth, the United States is now a lawless, scantly populated wasteland. The machines have stopped. The government has collapsed. Farmlands lie fallow and the soil is contaminated by toxins. Across the country, families have packed up their belongings to travel eastward toward the one hope left: passage on a ship to Europe.Franklin Lopez and his brother, Jackson, are only days away from the ocean when Franklin, nearly crippled by an inflamed knee, is forced to stop. In the woods near his temporary refuge, Franklin comes upon an isolated stone building. Inside he finds Margaret, a woman with a deadly infection and confined to the Pesthouse to sweat out her fever. Tentatively, the two join forces and make their way through the ruins of old America. Confronted by bandits rounding up men for slavery, finding refuge in the Ark, a religious community that makes bizarre demands on those they shelter, Franklin and Margaret find their wariness of each other replaced by deep trust and an intimacy neither one has ever experienced before.The Pesthouse is Jim Crace's most compelling novel to date. Rich in its understanding of America's history and ethos, it is a paean to the human spirit.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Over seven days we follow the lives of seven major characters: a hedge fund manager trying to bring off the biggest trade of his career; a professional footballer recently arrived from Poland; a young lawyer with little work and too much time to speculate; a student who has been led astray by Islamist theory; a hack book-reviewer; a schoolboy hooked on skunk and reality TV; and a Tube train driver whose Circle Line train joins these and countless other lives together in a daily loop.With daring skill, the novel pieces together the complex patterns and crossings of modern urban life. Greed, the dehumanising effects of the electronic age and the fragmentation of society are some of the themes dealt with in this savagely humorous book. The writing on the wall appears in letters ten feet high, but the characters refuse to see it – and party on as though tomorrow is a dream.Sebastian Faulks probes not only the self-deceptions of this intensely realised group of people, but their hopes and loves as well. As the novel moves to its gripping climax, they are forced, one by one, to confront the true nature of the world they inhabit.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Press|Language English|Pages 376,"From the author of ""The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity"", this book examines a central theme in Western Culture: The Centuries-Old Notion Of Hell - Exile From God, Subjection To fire, worms and darkness. In this study, Alan Bernstein investigates just How And Why Belief In Hell Arose. Although We May Associate The Notion Of hell with Christian beliefs, its gradual emergence depended on Conflicting Notions That Pervaded The Mediterranean World More Than A millennium before the birth of Christ. Bernstein takes us back to those times and offers us a view of the philosophy, poetry, folklore, myth and theology of that formative age.; Drawing on sources from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome and Israel, as well as early Christian writings, the author reconstructs the story of the prophets, priests and poets who fashioned concepts of hell from an array of perspectives on death and justice. The author traces hell's formation through close readings of works including the epics of Homer and Virgil, the satires of Lucian, the dialogues of Plato and Plutarch, the legends of Enoch, the confessions of the Psalms, the prophecies of Isaiah, Ezechiel and Daniel and the parables of Jesus. Re-enacting debates about the nature of hell among the common people and the elites of diverse religious traditions, he provides new insight into the social implications and the psychological consequences of different visions of the afterlife. This book aims to captivate readers interested in history, mythology. literature, psychology, philosophy and religion. It should be of use to ancient historians, classicists, theologists, and cultural historians.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On the contrary, Murakami finds that moral drama came into its own in the sixteenth century as a method for challenging normative views on ethics, economics, social rank, and political obligation. From its inception in itinerate troupe productions of the late fifteenth century, ""moral play"" served not as a cloistered form, but as a volatile public forum. This book demonstrates how the genre's apparently inert conventions from allegorical characters to the battle between good and evil for Mankind's soul veiled critical explorations of topical issues. Through close analysis of plays representing key moments of formal and ideological innovation from 1465 to 1599, Murakami makes a new argument for what is at stake in the much-discussed anxiety around the entwined social practices of professional theater and the emergent capitalist market. Moral play fostered a phenomenon that was ultimately more threatening to the peace of the realm than either theater or the notorious market--a political self-consciousness that gave rise to ephemeral, non-elite counterpublics who defined themselves against institutional forms of authority""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Christopher Heywood discusses selected poems, plays and prose works in five literary traditions: Khoisan, Nguni-Sotho, Afrikaans, English, and Indian. The discussion includes over 100 authors and selected works, including poets from Mqhayi, Marais and Campbell to Butler, Serote and Krog, theatre writers from Boniface and Black to Fugard and Mda, and fiction writers from Schreiner and Plaatje to Bessie Head and the Nobel prizewinners Gordimer and Coetzee. The literature is explored in the setting of crises leading to the formation of modern South Africa, notably the rise and fall of the Emperor Shaka's Zulu kingdom, the Colenso crisis, industrialisation, the colonial and post-colonial wars of 1899, 1914, and 1939, and the dissolution of apartheid society. In Heywood's study, South African literature emerges as among the great literatures of the modern world.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Metropolitan art and literature, 1810-1840",Gregory Dart,literature,First published in 2012,/works/OL16607606W,/authors/OL219085A/Gregory_Dart,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""Gregory Dart expands upon existing notions of Cockneys and the 'Cockney School' in the late Romantic period by exploring some of the broader ramifications of the phenomenon in art and periodical literature. He argues that the term was not confined to discussion of the Leigh Hunt circle, but was fast becoming a way of gesturing towards everything in modern metropolitan life that seemed discrepant and disturbing. Covering the ground between Romanticism and Victorianism, Dart presents Cockneyism as a powerful critical currency in this period, which helps provide a link between the works of Leigh Hunt and Keats in the 1810s and the early works of Charles Dickens in the 1830s. Through an examination of literary history, art history, urban history and social history, this book identifies the early nineteenth century figure of the Cockney as the true ancestor of modernity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"Heresy trials and English women writers, 1400-1670",Genelle Gertz,literature,First published in 2012,/works/OL16617736W,/authors/OL7118985A/Genelle_Gertz,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""This book charts the emergence of women's writing from the procedures of heresy trials and recovers a tradition of women's trial narratives from the late Middle Ages to the seventeenth century. Analyzing the interrogations of Margery Kempe, Anne Askew, Marian Protestant women, Margaret Clitherow and Quakers Katherine Evans and Sarah Cheevers, the book examines the complex dynamics of women's writing, preaching and authorship under religious persecution and censorship. Archival sources illuminate not only the literary choices women made, showing how they wrote to justify their teaching even when their authority was questioned, but also their complex relationship with male interrogators. Women's speech was paradoxically encouraged and constrained, and male editors preserved their writing while shaping it to their own interests. This book challenges conventional distinctions between historical and literary forms while identifying a new tradition of women's writing across Catholic, Protestant and Sectarian communities and the medieval/early modern divide""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Meet Veronica Ferris, the daughter of an imperious socialite and a kindly but absent diplomat. Fresh out of college, Veronica lands in Manhattan in pursuit of romance, disco, and rock 'n' roll — an arrival that threatens to usurp her mother's ambitious assault on New York high society. Maintaining her ""double life"" as a talented partygoer and a bearer of the esteemed Ferris family name is a high-wire act that requires far more cunning and restraint than young Veronica initially realizes. With its unforgettable heroine and wry, highly entertaining voice, Covergirl is at once a poignant coming-of-age tale, a delightful social satire, and a vibrant modern-day odyssey.

Driss has spent sixteen years in France, but now re-establishes his relations with his mother and brothers. Gradually Driss realizes how old family values have given way to the ideas of the West. ""Remember, Driss? Would any of us have dared to start dinner before he got back, whether it was after midnight or dawn? You remember, don't you?"". The author Driss Chraïbi (1926-2007) is a French-Moroccan novelist, considered to be the father of the modern Moroccan novel. Chraïbi's work drew heavily on his own life. Central theme in his novels was the clash between different cultures, the East and the West, Arab and French. Chraïbi's range of style changes from epic to comedy. He was one of the pioneers of Maghrebian writers to explore the oppression of women and children in an Islamic, patriarchal society.

Supernatural Environments in Shakespeare's England explores a series of cultural spaces that focused attention on interactions between the human and the demonic or divine: the deathbed, purgatory, demonic contracts and their spatial surround, Reformation cosmologies and a landscape newly subject to cartographic surveying. It examines the seemingly incongruous coexistence of traditional religious beliefs and new mathematical, geometrical ways of perceiving the environment. Arguing that the late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century stage dramatized the phenomenological tension that resulted from this uneasy confluence, this groundbreaking study considers the complex nature of supernatural environments in Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and Shakespeare's Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth and The Tempest""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Was Jesus actually married to Mary Magdalene? Was she one of his disciples and did she write her own gospel? Did they have a child together? Did some geniuses of art and science, people like Leonardo da Vinci and Isaac Newton, belong to secret societies that had the most compelling insider information in history, and did Leonardo convey some of these ideas in The Last Supper and other paintings? Secrets of the Code is the definitive guide to the novel and provides the curious reader with authoritative explorations into the major themes within The Da Vinci Code. Dan Burstein has distilled the views of the experts - archaeologists, theologians, art historians, philosophers and scientists - to sort out fact, informed speculation and fiction. Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorised Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci Code will delight and engage everyone who finished The Da Vinci Code thinking, 'I need to know more about this book.'

Transformations of Sensibility: The Phenomenology of Meiji Literature,Hideo Kamei,literature,First published in 2001,/works/OL15710240W,/authors/OL4714220A/Hideo_Kamei,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8797231M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  University of Michigan Press|Pages 375,"First published in Japan in 1983, this book is now a classic in modern Japanese literary studies. Covering an astonishing range of texts from the Meiji period (1868–1912), it presents sophisticated analyses of the ways that experiments in literary language produced multiple new—and sometimes revolutionary—forms of sensibility and subjectivity. Along the way, Kamei Hideo carries on an extended debate with Western theorists such as Saussure, Bakhtin, and Lotman, as well as with such contemporary Japanese critics as Karatani Kojin and Noguchi Takehiko.  Transformations of Sensibility deliberately challenges conventional wisdom about the rise of modern literature in Japan and offers highly original close readings of works by such writers as Futabatei Shimei, Tsubouchi Shoyo, Higuchi Ichiyo, and Izumi Kyoka, as well as writers previously ignored by most scholars. It also provides a new critical theorization of the relationship between language and sensibility, one that links the specificity of Meiji literature to broader concerns that transcend the field of Japanese literary studies. Available in English translation for the first time, it includes a new preface by the author and an introduction by the translation editor that explain the theoretical and historical contexts in which the work first appeared.

Reading and the history of race in the Renaissance,Elizabeth Spiller,literature,First published in 2011,/works/OL16116710W?edition=ia%3Areadinghistoryra00spil,/authors/OL1518192A/Elizabeth_Spiller,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25004418M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 252,"""Elizabeth Spiller studies how early modern attitudes towards race were connected to assumptions about the relationship between the act of reading and the nature of physical identity. As reading was understood to happen in and to the body, what you read could change who you were. In a culture in which learning about the world and its human boundaries came increasingly through reading, one place where histories of race and histories of books intersect is in the minds and bodies of readers. Bringing together ethnic studies, book history and historical phenomenology, this book provides a detailed case study of printed romances and works by Montalvo, Heliodorus, Amyot, Ariosto, Tasso, Cervantes, Munday, Burton, Sidney and Wroth. Reading and the History of Race traces ways in which print culture and the reading practices it encouraged, contributed to shifting understandings of racial and ethnic identity""--Provided by publisher.

His second chance lies in a small Nebraska farm town, where the landmarks include McKibben's Mobil Station, Frmka's Superette, and a sign that says The Wages of Sin is Hell. This is Goodnight, a place so ingrown and provincial that Randall calls it ""Sludgeville""-until he starts thinking of it as home. In this pitch-perfect novel, Tom McNeal explores the currents of hope, passion, and cruelty beneath the surface of the American heartland. In  Randall, McNeal creates an outcast whose redemption lies in Goodnight, a strange, small, but ultimately embracing community where Randall will inspire fear and adulation, win the love of a beautiful girl and nearly throw it all away.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Here, a sensitive young woman like Kathrine finds  few outlets for her desires. Half Norwegian, half Sami (an indigenous people), Kathrine  works for the customs office inspecting the fishing boats arriving regularly in the  harbor. She is in her late 20s, has a son from an early marriage, and has drifted  into a second loveless marriage to a man whose cold and dominating conventionality  forms a bold stroke through the unformed landscape of her life. After she makes a  discovery about her husband that deeply wounds her, Kathrine cuts loose from her  moorings and her confusion and sets off in search of herself. Her journey begins  aboard a ship headed south, taking her below the Arctic Circle for the first time  in her life. Kathrine makes her way to France and has the bittersweet experience  of a love affair that flares and dies quickly, her starved senses rewarded by the  shimmering beauty of Paris. Through a series of poignant encounters, Kathrine is  led to the richer life she was meant to have and is brave enough to claim. Using  simple words strung together in a melodic alphabet, Peter Stamm introduces us, through  a series of intimate sketches, to the heart of an unforgettable woman. Her story  speaks eloquently about solitude, the fragility of love, lost illusions, and self-discovery.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Thus speaks Dr David McBride, a psychiatrist for whom death exerts an unusual draw. As a young child he witnessed the death of his six-year-old brother and it is this traumatic event which has shaped his own personality and choice of profession. One day a failed suicide, Elizabeth Cruikshank, is admitted to his hospital. She is unusually reticent and it is not until he recalls a painting by Caravaggio that she finally yields up her story.We learn of Elizabeth Cruikshank's dereliction of trust, and the man she has lost, through David's narration. As her story unfolds David finds his own life being touched by her account and a haunting sense that the 'other side' of his elusive patient has a strange resonance for him, too.Set partly in Rome, 'The Other Side of You' explores the theme of redemption through love and art, which has become a hallmark of Salley Vickers's acclaimed work. As with her other highly popular novels this is a many-layered and subtly audacious story, which traces the boundaries of life and death and the difficult possibilities of repentance.

Presented as his intimate ""confessions,"" Harry's story takes us from his teenage days as a small-time crook to his fateful meeting with the equally young Dillinger to the pinnacle of his notoriety, and to his final hours in the penitentiary death house.Crafted in James Carlos Blake's signature style of fast-paced violence, sizzling sex, and darkly raucous humor, Handsome Harry re-creates a thrilling chapter from the chronicles of American crime.

Norton & Co.|Language English|Pages 380,"Experienced biographer Jeffrey Meyers delves into the complex personal history of the man whose visionary work gave us the great anti-utopias of twentieth-century literature. Meyers draws on a close study of the new edition of Orwell's complete works, interviews with his family and friends, and research into unpublished material in the Orwell Archive in London, to shed new light on this most unusual literary figure. A child of the waning British Empire, Orwell came to reject the stifling class system of his birth, and through his writing forged a new social consciousness that continues to engage modern intellectual thought. Meyers' work also reveals the human failings of this creative visionary--his childhood insecurities, his political dilemmas, and his conflicted relationships with women. The Orwell who emerges from this book is a darker--but distinctly more nuanced--portrait of the legendary figure.--From publisher description.

Moving beyond a focus on individual literary texts, the book presents ample coverage of the different schools, methods, and assumptions that have affected the discipline over the years. It examines notable works and authors from the period, including Beowulf, the Venerable Bede, heroic poems, and devotional literature. It also uses excerpts from ten critical studies to reinforce key perspectives and methods introduced within the text. The book addresses the complex questions of medieval literacy, textuality, and orality, as well as issues of style, gender, genre, and theme. It embraces the interdisciplinary nature of the field with references to historical studies, religious studies, anthropology, art history, and much more. Drawing on over a century's worth of scholarly work, this is an essential guide to the factors that have shaped the modern critical reception of the earliest English literature""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the lands of Bethel, where the Prophet’s word is law, Immanuelle Moore’s very existence is blasphemy. Her mother’s union with an outsider of a different race cast her once-proud family into disgrace, so Immanuelle does her best to worship the Father, follow Holy Protocol, and lead a life of submission, devotion, and absolute conformity, like all the other women in the settlement.  But a mishap lures her into the forbidden Darkwood surrounding Bethel, where the first prophet once chased and killed four powerful witches. Their spirits are still lurking there, and they bestow a gift on Immanuelle: the journal of her dead mother, who Immanuelle is shocked to learn once sought sanctuary in the wood.  Fascinated by the secrets in the diary, Immanuelle finds herself struggling to understand how her mother could have consorted with the witches. But when she begins to learn grim truths about the Church and its history, she realizes the true threat to Bethel is its own darkness. And she starts to understand that if Bethel is to change, it must begin with her.   Read more Read less",27 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

Still, this commanding, mesmerizing man inflames her imagination in a most improper manner. When the magnificent Khair Bey steals into her bedroom, Louisa is transported to a breathtaking realm of sensual pleasure she had only previously imagined. And now she must flee his kisses and hot, demanding touch or she will be lost forever.But on her journey home, Louisa is captured by pirates and spirited away to be auctioned off to the highest bidder — a bitter fate that turns shockingly sweet when she is purchased by the very man who has awakened her slumbering desires.

S. Naipaul's magnificent Magic Seeds continues the story of Willie Chandran, the perennially dissatisfied and self-destructively naive protagonist of his bestselling Half a Life.Having left a wife and a livelihood in Africa, Willie is persuaded to return to his native India to join an underground movement on behalf of its oppressed lower castes. Instead he finds himself in the company of dilettantes and psychopaths, relentlessly hunted by police and spurned by the people he means to liberate. But this is only one stop in a quest for authenticity that takes in all the fanaticism and folly of the postmodern era. Moving with dreamlike swiftness from guerrilla encampment to prison cell, from the squalor of rural India to the glut and moral desolation of 1980s London, Magic Seeds is a novel of oracular power, dazzling in its economy and unblinking in its observations.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Other walls surround her as well--walls of fear, rejection, and unworthiness.  A woman with a wrecked past; a man of success, of faith...of pride. A marriage only God would conceive! Through the heartaches of a stormy relationship, Rahab and Salmone learn the true source of one another's worth and find healing in God.

With the exception of Tyler's earliest two novels, which she prefers to forget, a chapter is devoted to each of the other novels she has written. Following a biographical chapter that relates Tyler's life to her work, Bail discusses the novels within the literary tradition of Southern regional literature, women's literature, and popular culture. He also explores the influence of religion on her writing. Bail also offers an alternate critical approach from which to read the novel, such as feminist or multicultural criticism. This study is ideal for students and readers of Anne Tyler and will enrich the reading and appreciation of her novels.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While there's a host of types and situations here, most center on village streets, petty bourgeoisie society, and academia. In truth, when a character in ""Venice, Now and Then"" says that ""Things are so inconstant. That's the trouble,"" she could be speaking for most of her fictional cohorts: an aging English lady with insomnia (""The Voice of God in Adelaide Terrace""); a befuddled housewife whose ""treasure"" of a maid turns out to be a domineering sneak-thief (""Help""); and a professor suffering through the small humiliations of academia (""Revenant as Typewriter""), among many others. In addition to ""Help,"" other notables include: ""Nothing Missing but the Samovar,"" about a German Anglophile who spends a touching season with a sympathetically drawn family of shabbygenteel aristocrats at the end of their economic tether; ""Corruption,"" a delicately textured portrait involving an aging judge, his wife, a female interloper, and a box of confiscated pornography; ""The Pill Box,"" very short and a little metafictional (""How, having glimpsed the possibility of the impossible, can the world remain as steady as you had supposed?""); and"" The Dream Merchant,"" a whimsical portrait of a sensible man who sells dreams from 9:30-5:00 but doesn't believe in them: ""that was the secret of his success.""

Here on Earth was an Oprah Book Club selection. Practical Magic and Aquamarine were both bestselling books and Hollywood movies. Her novels have received mention as notable books of the year by the New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and People magazine, and her short fiction and nonfiction have appeared in the New York Times, The Boston Globe Magazine, Kenyon Review, Redbook, Architectural Digest, Gourmet, and Self. Now, in The Third Angel, Hoffman weaves a magical and stunningly original story that charts the lives of three women in love with the wrong men: Headstrong Madeleine Heller finds herself hopelessly attracted to her sister's fiance. Frieda Lewis, a doctor's daughter and a runaway, becomes the muse of an ill-fated rock star. And beautiful Bryn Evans is set to marry an Englishman while secretly obsessed with her ex-husband. At the heart of the novel is Lucy Green, who blames herself for a tragic accident she witnessed at the age of twelve, and who spends four decades searching for the Third Angel--the angel on earth who will renew her faith.Brilliantly evoking London's King's Road, Knightsbridge, and Kensington while moving effortlessly back in time, The Third Angel is a work of startling beauty about the unique, alchemical nature of love.From the Hardcover edition.

Through personal and literary encounters, Phillips probes the meaning of cultural dislocation, measuring the distinguishing features of our identities--geographic, racial, national, religious--against the amalgamating effects of globalization. In the work of writers such as V. S. Naipaul, James Baldwin, and Zadie Smith, cultural figures such as Steven Spielberg, Linton Kwesi Johnson, and Marvin Gaye, and in his own experiences, Phillips detects the erosion of cultural boundaries and amasses startling and poignant insights on whether there can be an answer anymore to the question ""Where are you from?"" The result is an illuminating--and powerfully relevant--account of identity from an exceedingly perceptive citizen of the world.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Performing oaths in classical Greek drama,Judith Fletcher,literature,First published in 2011,/works/OL16015118W,/authors/OL6965029A/Judith_Fletcher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""Oaths were ubiquitous rituals in ancient Athenian legal, commercial, civic and international spheres. Their importance is reflected by the fact that much of surviving Greek drama features a formal oath sworn before the audience. This is the first comprehensive study of that phenomenon. The book explores how the oath can mark or structure a dramatic plot, at times compelling characters like Euripides' Hippolytus to act contrary to their best interests. It demonstrates how dramatic oaths resonate with oath rituals familiar to the Athenian audiences. Aristophanes' Lysistrata and her accomplices, for example, swear an oath that blends protocols of international treaties with priestesses' vows of sexual abstinence. By employing the principles of Speech Act theory, this book examines how the performative power of the dramatic oath can mirror the status quo, but also disturb categories of gender, social status and civic identity in ways that redistribute and confound social authority""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Mike Engleby says things that others dare not even think.When the novel opens in the 1970s, he is a university student, having survived a 'traditional' school.

One of his contemporaries unaccountably disappears, and as we follow Engleby's career, which brings us up to the present day, the reader has to ask: is Engleby capable of telling the whole truth?

When a routine doctor's visit leads to an unexpected prognosis, a great yearning takes hold of him--but who can tell if it is homesickness or wanderlust? Andreas leaves everything behind, sells his Paris apartment; cuts off all social ties; quits his teaching job; and waves goodbye to his days spent idly sitting in cafes--to look for a woman he once loved, half a lifetime ago. The monotony of days has been keeping him in check; now he hopes for a miracle and for a new beginning. Andreas' travels lead him back to the province of his youth, back to his hometown in Switzerland where he returns to familiar streets, where his brother still lives in their childhood home, and where Fabienne, a woman he was obsessed with in his youth, visits the same lake they once swam in together. Andreas, still consumed with longing for his lost love and blinded by the uncertainty of his future, is tormented by the question of what might have been if things had happened differently. Peter Stamm has been praised as a ""stylistic ascetic"" and his prose as ""distinguished by lapidary expression, telegraphic terseness, and finely tuned sensitivity"" (Bookforum). In On a Day Like This, Stamm's unobtrusive observational style allows us to journey with our antihero through his crises of banality, of living in his empty world, and the realization that life is finite--that one must live it, as long as that is possible.Praise for Unformed Landscape:""Sensitive and unnerving. . . . An uncommonly intimate work, one that will remind the reader of his or her own lived experience with a greater intensity than many of the books that are published right here at home."" --The New Republic Online""If Albert Camus had lived in an age when people in remote Norwegian fishing villages had e-mail, he might have written a novel like this.""--The New Yorker""Unformed Landscape has a refreshing purity, a lack of delusion, a lack of hype.""--Los Angeles TimesFrom the Hardcover edition.

It is thus primarily a physiological treatise rather than a materia medica or a work on pathology. Galen commences with a short section on the epistemology of medicine, with a discussion on the attainment, through apodeixis or demonstration, of scientific truth - a discussion which reveals the Aristotelian roots of his thinking. The text then covers a wide range of foods, both common and exotic. Some, such as cereals, legumes, dairy products and the grape, receive an emphasis that reflects their importance at the time; others are treated more cursorily. Dr Powell, an expert in gastroenterology, discusses Galen's terminology and the background to his views on physiology and pathology in his introduction, while John Wilkins' foreword concentrates on the structural and cultural aspects of the work.

Coggeshall (1824-1867) was a journalist and publisher, and editor of The Genius of the West, a literary magazine in Cincinnati. He served as State Librarian of Ohio from 1856 to 1862.  The editor wrote in his Preface that it was his intention to include in the collection every person “…legitimately belonging to the West, who has gained recognition as a writer of reputable verse.” It contains selections, with biographical notices, from the writings of 97 men and 55 women. 60 were residents of Ohio, 23 of Indiana, 14 of Kentucky, 13 of Illinois, 5 of Michigan and 4 of Wisconsin. Not more than 10 of these poets pursued literature as a profession. The volume contains poems from about 1815 to the early 1860s.  The book is very substantial in size and the biographies are sometimes surprisingly detailed. Entries are in chronological order, and the first ones contain valuable background detail about the early literary life of Cincinnati.

Naipaul brings his signature gifts of observation, his ferocious impatience with received truths, and his masterfully condensed prose to these eleven essays on reading, writing, and identity--which have been brought together for the first time.Here the subject is Naipaul's literary evolution: the books that delighted him as a child; the books he wrote as a young man; the omnipresent predicament of trying to master an essentially metropolitan, imperial art form as an Asian colonial from a New World plantation island. He assesses Joseph Conrad, the writer most frequently cited as his forebear, and, in his celebrated Nobel Lecture, ""Two Worlds,"" traces the full arc of his own career.

Its publication in 1904 came in the turbulent decade following the success of his novels Hunger and Mysteries. Hounded across Europe by a female stalker, unhappily married and later divorced, drinking heavily and bankrupted by his gambling, Hamsun returned to his childhood home at Hamarøy in the far north of Norway. There he lived alone in a turf hut and composed many of the poems in this collection, inspired by the arctic summer, the forests, mountains and fjords. The book resulted in a revival of lyric poetry in Norway, with these poems to this day continuing to be read and admired.
