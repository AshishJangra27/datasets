In poems that both embody and inhabit this double shadow, risk and faintheartedness prove to have the power equally to rescue us from ourselves and to destroy us. Spare, haunted, and haunting, yet not without hope, Double Shadow argues for life as a wilderness through which there's only the questing forward―with no regrets and no looking back.

Orr argues that readers should accept the foreignness of poetry in the way that they accept the strangeness of any place to which they haven't traveled--they should expect a little confusion, at least at first. Yet in the same way that we can, over time, learn to appreciate the idiosyncratic delights of, for instance, Belgium, we can learn to be comfortable with the odd pleasures of poetry by taking our time and pursuing what we like.  Reading poetry, Orr suggests, is more a matter of building a relationship than proceeding systematically through a checklist. Beautiful & Pointless provides the foundation for such a relationship by examining the things poets and poetry readers talk about when they discuss poetry, such as why poetry seems especially personal and what it means to write ""in form."" Orr, by turns acerbic, incisive, hilarious, and keen, is what every reader hopes for: that perfect guide who points the way, doesn't talk too much, and helps you see what you might have missed. Stimulating, amusing, and utterly engrossing, Beautiful & Pointless allows us to see how an individual reader engages poetry, so that we may feel better equipped to appreciate it in our own way.""--Book jacket.

He looks tragically alone, bereft, cut loose from the comforting anchors of religious faith, and yet he seems surprisingly tranquil. In this collection, I have transcribed the poems—I think of them as songs—which I believe this man sings in the depths of his heart. Yes, his Mystical Faith Exploded in the Midst of a Cathedral, but after years of wandering, he has found joy, coherence, cohesion—his voice. I have titled this book God: A Handbook for the Disbeliever because I think of it as a comforting treasury of verses for all of us who travel this treacherous journey of life alone.

Poetry is never more vital, meaningful, or accessible than in the hands of David Orr. In the pieces collected here, most of them written originally for the New York Times, Orr is at his rigorous, conversational, and edifying best. Whether he is considering the careers of contemporary masters, such as Louise Gluckor Frederick Seidel, sizing up younger American poets, like Matthea Harvey and Matthew Zapruder, or even turning his attention to celebrities and public figures, namely Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Fry, when they choose to wade into the hotly contested waters of the poetry world, Orr is never any less than fully persuasive in arguing what makes a poem or poet great--or not.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Having established an English-language following largely on the merits of a single poem, Bilotserkivets's larger body of work continues to be relatively unknown. She was an active participant in ""Ukraine's Renaissance"" of the late-Soviet and early-independence period. Now, nearly thirty years on, much has changed in her birth land, but the lyricism and urgency in Bilotserkivets's poetry remain; her voice still speaks about movement and restricted movement, even symbolic movement. Eccentric Days of Hope and Sorrow endeavors to return to shed light on the missing history.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The poems engage multiple methods to make sense of this pervasive tool, its powers, nuances, and influences over the structure of our civilizations. Through investigations of ecology, capitalism, military powers, colonialization, and supremacy, the book uncovers patterns in the ways that language is active in perpetuating inequality and binding its subjects to the will of those in positions of authority. In questioning systems of oppression, the poems also offer the hope of forging new paths through the connecting power of language.

This collection includes work from her five books, poems previously published only in magazines, and a section of new poems. With a poetics as attentive to the music of thought as George Oppen's and an ear that evokes the wildness of Rimbaud's Illuminations, Willis charts intricate, subterranean affinities. Her poems draw us into a range of pleasures and concerns--from the scientific pastorals of Erasmus Darwin, to the domain of painters, politicians, erstwhile saints, witches, and agitators. Within the intimate and civic address of these poems, we witness the chaos of the contemporary world as it falls, for an ecstatic moment, into place: ""The word comes at me with its headlights on, so it's revelation and not death.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the last eighteen hundred years Indian arts have been seen in terms of strictly classified emotional effects known as the nine rasas. The Tenth Rasa: An Anthology of Indian Nonsense celebrates, for the very first time, what Sukumar Ray called 'the spirit of whimsy', or the tenth rasa, through the topsy-turvy, irreverent, melodic genre of nonsense literature. This fabulous selection of poetry and prose, brilliantly translated from seventeen Indian languages across India, includes works by Rabindranath Tagore, Sukumar Ray, Vinda Karandikar, Gulzar, Dash Benhur, Manoj Das, Navakanta Barua, Mangesh Padgavkar, Sri Sri, Vaikom Mohammad Basheer, Kunjunni and other known, lesser-known and previously unpublished authors. In forms as varied as stories and songs for children and adults, lullabies, folk tales, Bollywood song lyrics and medieval court verse, the writers open doors to wildly imaginative worlds populated by peculiar characters and fantastical creatures, where only nonsense makes perfect sense. Crackling with wit, wordplay and riotous rhymes, and frequently revelling in pure gibberish, this immensely entertaining collection will delight you from start to finish.

Heavy Grace: Poems,Robert Cording,poetry,First published in 1996,/works/OL2979824W,/authors/OL456004A/Robert_Cording,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL811565M-M.jpg,Publish Date April 1996|Publisher  Alice James Books|Language English|Pages 69,"“Robert Cording’s Heavy Grace tolls the bells. These are highly likable poems in which the pain of loved ones’ demises is wrestled into free-verse stanzas. Buttressing the elegies that form the heart of the collection are psalms of joy rooted in nature and fatherhood. . . . Heavy Grace is an unflinching and affecting treatment of painful subjects and ultimate themes.    —Poetry  “Robert Cording’s third collection of poems, Heavy Grace, is a luminous addition to the literature of last things, which is always rooted in the here and now. The quotidian is the subject of these quiet lyrics, and what they reveal is the steady gaze of a man determined to confront his mortal fears. This is a poet as familiar with the ways of birds as with what he calls the ‘deep syntax of grief’. Like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, one of the brave spirits hovering behind this book, Cording recognized that the ‘heart cannot be comforted,’ yet his stern poems offer a measure of solace, a kind of grace—a way to live in the here, the now.”    —Christopher Merrill  “Robert Cording’s work offers a subtle but unmistakable critique of Romanticism—or at least of the attenuated romanticism we’ve known in American poetry for 30 plus years. To that extent, it may be part of a broad contemporary reaction, in which unlikely factions (‘new narrative’ poets, postmodern poets, even language poets) vaguely collaborate.  Yet Cording’s part in this general trend, supposing there to be one, involves religious vision. In an epoch whose authors are sentimental about their unbelief and about the primacy of their ungoverned selves, Cording demands a setting aside of the self, an emptying of the egoist vessel. Such an essentially humble pursuit of spiritual ends has not yet won Cording the reputation he merits. But for all that his poetry is perhaps as prophetic.  We may hope so, for what could we need more than a canny guide to being in the ‘heavy’ world—with its beasts and work and birds and spouses and pain and children and joy—while remaining open to all that is graceful within its quotidian bounds. . .and elsewhere?”    —Sydney Lea   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It has been in the town for over 200 years. In 1996, community members decided to find out what they could about it. Historians discovered that the bones were those of a slave name Fortune, who was owned by a local doctor. After Fortune's death, the doctor rendered the bones. Further research revealed that Fortune had married, had fathered four children, and had been baptized later in life. His bones suggest that after a life of arduous labor, he died in 1798 at about the age of 60. Merilyn Nelson wrote The Manumission Requiem to commemorate Fortune's life. Detailed notes and archival photographs enhance the reader's appreciation of the poem.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Notably, such poems appear alongside those that engage questions about God, war, difference, death, love, and illness. Thus, the anthology validates women’s experiences as human experience.”    —AGNI Online  “. . . a wild stretching voice through time and knowledge. . . . Lit from Inside is an enticing pick for any literary poetry collection. . .”    —Midwest Book Review  “Alice James Books has been one of the major forces in American poetry for the past four decades. . . . This is an essential book for readers who want to understand and enjoy contemporary American poetry.”    —Publishers Weekly, starred review  “Alice James Books is one of the pure sources of American poetry. . . [the press] has started the careers of too many poets to name. This anthology is a birthday celebration in book form. . .”    —NPR.org  “The history of American poetry is the history of the small press, and Alice James Books, true to its origins in the Seventies as a collective operation, is a large and very distinctive chapter in that history, well deserving of this anthology showcasing its poets and work, both experimental and traditional, that ranks among the most important of the past four decades. The next time a student poet asks me for an anthology that will teach her the art in its most exemplary and current state, this is the one I will hand her.”    —B.H. Fairchild  “The founding members of Alice James Books welcomed me, in 1975, to a crew of feisty individuals committed to poetry. Unfettered by demands of market or profit, the press published—for forty years— tantalizing collections. Culture; family; feminism; friendship; history; passion; racism; war: it’s all in this anthology, a rewarding testimony to the independent spirit.”    —Robin Becker  “…I can’t forget the example of those early gatherings, the orderly procedures and professional force, all triggered by an idea of liberation and poetry.”    —Fanny Howe  “The list of authors is remarkable for its breadth, variety, and passion. This is a big book: a reader needs fortitude to undertake its 207 pages, but anthologies are meant to be sipped, not gulped thirstily…I have downed the entire collection, 130-odd disparate celebratory, elegiac, lyrical, lofty, comic, surreal, imagist, formalist, postmodern bards. The assortment is idiosyncratic, the range of voices an styles embraces the familiar personal narrative voice and the innovative, often dissonant music of more experimental poems.”    —Maxine Kumin  “Alice James Books is proof of the adage ‘the older you are, the better you get.'”    —Publishers Weekly   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Confessional detail and philosophical argument are reduced to traces, but their resonance from underneath leaves no doubt that this work is serious. This is a book I will be living with for a long time to come.”    —Alan Williamson  “Jane Mead penetrates grief with alacrity and burning self-scrutiny. This work enters the world like wild rain and lightning, an inheritance from Celan’s and Tsvetaeva’s stuttered lyricism. Those who can brave the revolutions in her music will choose life because of its difficulty.”    —Jane Miller  “Jane Mead’s our Emily Dickinson, our most ambitious solitary. Her austere poems are brilliant: endlessly inventive, syntactically, tonally and emotionally rich. Alternately ironic and undefended, she never sacrifices compassion, justice, her quest for pleasure. In their longing and their loneliness, tending to the otherness of nature, the beauty of expression, these poems honor the frailty that makes us most human.”    —Ira Sadoff   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Her discussion may be of equal interest to poetry readers and beginning or experienced writers. She's neither a romantic nor a mechanic, but someone who has observed poems and their writing closely and who writes with unassuming authority about the work she and others do, interspersing history and analysis with exemplary poems (the poets include James Wright, William Carlos Williams, Elizabeth Bishop, Marianne Moore and Walt Whitman). Divided into short chapters on sound, the line, imagery, tone, received forms and free verse, the book also considers the need for revision (an Oliver poem typically passes through 40 or 50 drafts before it is done) and the pros and cons of writing workshops. And though her prose is wisely spare, a reader also falls gladly on signs of a poet: ""Who knows anyway what it is, that wild, silky part of ourselves without which no poem can live?'' or ""Poems begin in experience, but poems are not in fact experience . . . they exist in order to be poems.''

In Kate Northrop's finely-wrought verse, children have gone missing, sealed-off passages are discovered, and missing dogs emerge like visions before bounding off again. Northrop has a sixth sense for where the mundane and the uncanny pass too close for comfort—and no place more so than in the book's haunted centerpiece, a visceral rendering of a sixteenth-century Hungarian countess with certain insatiable appetites.  Gorgeous and strange, Things Are Disappearing Here is an imaginative tour-de-force.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Drawing on long out-of-print volumes and recent books—such as her acclaimed Spinoza in Her Youth (2002)—Where Shadows Will confirms Cole’s place as a major avant-garde poet and a leading voice among contemporary women writers.

Cette poésie sooninke d'inspiration personnelle sort du champ traditionnel en investissant des thèmes divers, en donnant la liberté au ""sefe"" (parole, verbe) à travers une écriture allant de l'idylle à l'héroïque. Ce recueil permet aux droits de la femme et des minorités de s'exprimer et invite l'histoire et la géographie, entre autres disciplines, pour aider à consolider un meilleur vivre ensemble, rudement éprouvé par le déni, le racisme et la stigmatisation. ""Grains de millet"" est donc une invite à l'imaginaire ""chassant le gibier pour reprendre des forces avec lesquelles la ""bauhinia"" remonte la sève"". Il s'agit, à travers ce texte, de parallèles avec une réalité où l'on se côtoie tout en s'ignorant, pour mieux se préserver à cause de la peur de l'autre et de l'inconnu - attitude qui pousse très souvent à l'enfermement, alors qu'il faudrait plutôt s'accepter, et accepter l'autre comme une richesse et un alter ego, et non comme un ennemi : ""an sondonmen wasa / dénoue ton coeur !

With language delicate, smooth, and wryly funny, Louise is on a voyage without destination, traveling with a cast of enigmatic others, including her lover, Ham. Louise is as musical as she is mysterious and the reader is invited to listen. In her world, anything goes, provided it is breathtaking. Bang, whose first collection was the prize-winning Apology for Want, both parodies and pays homage to the lyric tradition, borrowing its lush music and dramatic structure to give new voice to the old concerns of the late Romantic poets. Louise in Love is a dramatic postmodern verse-novel with an eloquent free-floating narration. The poems, rife with literary allusion, take journeys to distant lands. And, like anyone on a voyage without a destination, they are endlessly questioning of the enigmatic world around them.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Constructed as a sequence of mostly untitled poems, the fractured narrative of this innovative debut traces the physical, historical, and emotional terrain of female sexuality in lyric monologues both interior and dramatic. With these darkly powerful poems, Danielle Pafunda flips the notion of feminine innocence on its back, showing it's not as pure as people imagine.

Cailleach: The Hag of Beara,Leanne O'Sullivan,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL5880218W,/authors/OL1449445A/Leanne_O'Sullivan,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23692813M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 1, 2009|Publisher  Bloodaxe Books,              U.S. Distributor, Dufour Editions|Language English|Pages 62","An Cailleach Bhéarra, or the Hag of Beara, is a wise woman figure embedded in the physical and mental landscape of western Ireland and Scotland, particularly in the Beara Peninsula in West Cork where Leanne O’Sullivan comes from. The Cailleach’s roots lie in pre-Christian Ireland, and stories of her relationship with that rugged landscape and culture still abound. Central to these narratives is the story of her love affair with a sea god. A large stone rests on the ridge overlooking Ballycrovane Harbour, and it is said to be the petrified body of the Cailleach; she has had several lives, beginning each life with a birth from her stony form – and returning to stone at the end.  The supernatural and superhuman feature strongly in traditional stories of the Cailleach (pronounced Ca-lock or Cay-luck) – feats such as her creating mountains or leaping vast distances that place the tales firmly into the world of myth. While still recognising the Cailleach as a figure of extraordinary power and influence, Leanne O’Sullivan’s poems explore the human origins from which the legend grew. She still forms the landscape, yet at the same time is intrinsically part of it, close to it, rather than gigantically above it; and her husband is not the sea god of legend, but a fisherman. And for all her strength, she is vulnerable.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These poems are artful yet accessible, lyrical yet direct, strange but recognizable.  Smith’s relentless self-examination, fear, sense of humor, and vulnerability are all laid to bare in crisp, precise language. From lonely observations, bizarre medical fascinations, emotion, loss, and honesty, Blue on Blue Ground constructs its internal and external worlds.  The metaphorical city is also a “body,” a place of exile and restoration, a symbol of hope, a catalyst for connection.  The urban landscape is often the background for the moment or is the moment itself—the world looked at and sorted into words.  Though at times dark, there’s love to be found. Perhaps it’s what drives this collection, colors its observations, and leads it to finally announce: “Someone is putting the world back together.” Blue on Blue Ground wants to look at absolutely everything and believes that complete exploration of the physical and mental selves—fears and desires—is the key to moving and being completely alive in the material world.

Major Jackson, through both formal and free verse poems, renders visible the spirit of resilience, courage, and creativity he witnessed among his family, neighbors, and friends while growing up in Philadelphia. His poems hauntingly reflect urban decay and violence, yet at the same time they rejoice in the sustaining power of music and the potency of community. Jackson also honors artists who have served as models of resistance and maintained their own faith in the belief of the imagination to alter lives. The title poem, a dramatic monologue in the voice of the American jazz composer and bandleader Sun Ra, details such a humane program and serves as an admirable tribute to the tradition of African American art. Throughout, Jackson unflinchingly portrays our most devastated landscapes, yet with a vividness and compassion that expose the depth of his imaginative powers.

And he also showed that within him beat the heart of an artist -- a major factor in his resilience and recovery.  Now with Who Will Cry for the Little Boy?, his first collection of poetry, Antwone Fisher reveals the inner truths that took him from a tumultuous childhood to the man he is today. The powerful poems presented here range from impressions and expressions of Antwone's years growing up to the love that he has gained from the family he made for himself as an adult.  From the title poem — which is featured prominently in the movie Antwone Fisher — a plaintive, haunting tribute to a childhood lost to abuse and neglect, to ""Azure Indigo,"" the uplifting and touching poem about his daughters, many readers will find their own feelings and experiences reflected in this lyrical and passionate collection.

With a fragmentation more cubist than language poetry, Coletti portrays urban experience, from power relations and personal loss to nights among city dwellers fashioning language into something both recognizable and mysterious.John Coletti is the author of the book Mum Halo (2010) and the chapbooks Same Enemy Rainbow (2008) and Physical Kind (2005). With Anselm Berrigan, he is the author of the limited edition Skasers (2012). He has served as editor of The Poetry Project Newsletter and co-edits Open 24 Hours Press. Other projects include a collaborative print with artist Kiki Smith, a chapbook collaboration with Shana Moulton, and a libretto for Excelsior, an opera composed by Caleb Burhans commissioned by Chicago's Fifth House Ensemble which premiered in 2013.

Via “poetic memoir” we join his navigation through the “apolitical,” rigid morality of the Jehovah’s Witnesses; the revolutionary theories and free love of Black Panthers and Marxists; the promise of a bourgeois future from bank executives; a screaming soldier brandishing an AK-47 in his face, a blizzard of white termite wings; an interrogation under Haile Selassie’s Jubilee Palace; hallucinating of “of cornbread islands” at Chicago’s “Velvet Lounge,” and many “Street Signs, Convolutions, and other California Coincidences” as one poem is titled in this second collection. Warr’s poetry, like his life, is full of interruptions and circularity that captures the broad sweep of the times and microscopic idiosyncrasies of the moment.

From expansive meditation to haiku, in ode and epistle, dream sequence and elegy, Levin's new poems explore motifs deeply social and historical, personal and metaphysical. Their various strategies deploy the sonic powers of lyric, the montage techniques of cinema, and the atavistic energies of the oral tradition. Throughout this volume, the singularity of person, place, and thing--and the plurality of our experience--assert their uncanny presence: an ash on a crackling log, a character from Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, a burgundy scarf, an x-ray of Bruegel's ""Massacre of the Innocents,"" and a demitasse cup from Dresden are all woven into a collection by turns rhapsodic and ironic, caustic and incantatory. The pre-Socratic mathematician Zeno facing the riddle of an ordinary day; a cloudbank of silence; a pair of second-hand shoes bought for Anne Frank; two crows at play above the peak of a mountain; a dot flickering on the horizon: intimate and philosophical, these poems unveil the metamorphic properties of mind and nature""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Making use of dramatic monologue, elegy, humor, and collage, these poems explore hedonism, gender, ancestry, reincarnation, bereavement, and the nature of prayer. Groping for an inclusive, imaginative, postmodern spirituality, they draw from an array of sources, including the philosophy of the ancient Stoics, diagnostic tests for Alzheimer's disease, 1950s recipes, the Babylonian Talmud, and Walter Benjamin's writing on his drug experiences""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Poetry busts guts.""-Frank Stanford. The poetry publishing event of the season, this six-hundred-plus page book highlights the arc of Frank Stanford's all-too-brief and incandescently brilliant career. Despite critical praise and near-mythic status as a poet, Frank Stanford's oeuvre has never fully been unified. The mystery and legend surrounding his life-and his suicide before the age of thirty-has made it nearly impossible to fully and accurately celebrate his body of work. Until now. This welcome and necessary volume includes hundreds of previously unpublished poems, a short story, an interview, and is richly illustrated with draft poems, photographs, and odd ephemera. As Dean Young writes in the Foreword to the book: ""Many of these poems seem as if they were written with a burnt stick. With blood in river mud... Frank Stanford, demonically prolific, approaches the poem not as an exercise of rhetoric or a puzzle of signifiers but as a man 'looking for his own tongue' in a knife-fight with a ghost."" When It's After DarkI steal all the light bulbs and hide them like eggs in a basket going to some outlaw I put on the best I can find I cover them with a swatch of something that swells like a bite that bleeds green cloth that smells of a feed store but looks to of been worn I go over to nasty willy's bridge and throw them into the creek there in the shade I listen for them to make nests to escape agony and burst. Frank Stanford was born in Mississippi and worked as an unlicensed land surveyor. He published poetry, short fiction, and the epic 15,000-line poem The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You. In June 1978, he died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds.""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Blackout is the first book of his poetry available in English. Written immediately after he was indicted by Italian authorities and forced to flee, it has at its center the great New York blackout of 1977, a moment of chaos and panic, but also of mutual aid and social solidarity. This comes to stand in for the years from 1968-1979 in Italy, when a more or less open civil war between popular militants and the state escalated from strikes and riots to armed struggle. At once documentary and visionary, it is a poem of heroic and daily struggles for freedom, captured in heroic and daily language. It is a poem of popular revolt being crushed, a poem for our era as well as his.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An opening sequence presents contemporary ghost stories: men who gather at dawn in the gas station parking lots of small towns; the mountain lion that paces the edge of a receding tree line.

Not shying from the raw or savage in life, not ignoring the small moments of salvation or grace, she finds in every room an entrance to another world. Darwin's college quarters prove not far from his cabin on the Beagle. A dress shop in Virginia reveals itself a Federal parlor through which a battle of the Civil War was fought.

Finally, he has gathered these pieces, creating a striking book of poems that channels poets from Walt Whitman to Sylvia Plath and also calls upon jazz standards, Freudian questionnaires, and astrological profiles for inspiration. Intelligent and sparkling, this is a great gift for poetry fans and a useful resource for creative writers. These are poems of wit and humor but also deep emotion and clear intelligence, informed by Lehman's genuine and knowledgeable love of poetry and literature. From Catullus and Lady Murasaki to Wordsworth, Neruda, Virginia Woolf, W.H. Auden, and Charles Bukowski, Poems in the Manner Of shows how much life there is in poets of the past.

Timeless yet tirelessly inventive, Bang fashions her examination of the lived life into an abecedarius that is as rapturous in its language and music as it is affecting in its awareness of--and yearning for--what isn't there. The title of the first poem, ""ABC Plus E: Cosmic Aloneness Is the Bride of Existence,"" posits the collection's central problem, and a symposium of figures from every register of our culture (from Plato to Pee-wee Herman, Mickey Mouse to Sartre) is assembled to help confront it. Riddled with insight, pathos, and wit, The Bride of E is a brilliant new work by one the most compelling poets of our time.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Using this as a figure for sexual, political, and economic interactions, Wagner's poems shift between seductive lyricism and brash fragmentation as they negotiate the failure of human connection in the twilight of American empire. Intellectually informed, yet insistent on their objecthood, Wagner's poems express a self-conscious skepticism even as they maintain an optimistically charged eroticism.""

These poems speak of fragility and power, the contradictions of pleasure, the bruises we bear. With remarkable range, they carry us from a whitewater rafting calamity to the “torrents of wheat” on a family farm; from a peepshow’s “manageable storm of boredom and sex” to a passionate fall from grace in an orchard. By turns buoyant and forlorn, Rough Honey’s characters both long for and abandon hope of true connection, of home. But their struggles are rendered in language so radiant, it can’t help but hint at the possibility of transcendence, the sheer sweetness in being alive.

Deeply rooted in the recognizable landscapes and legacies of the American South, these lyric poems couple daring engagements in topics of race and sexuality with tender reflections on personal and cultural histories. Madden's adopted home of South Carolina rises to the surface in poems set at Folly Beach, Fort Moultrie, Lake Keowee, and Middleton Place. His interrogations of social oppression conjure the ubiquitous iconography of the bygone Confederacy, a first encounter with the miniseries Roots, and a cameo appearance by Strom Thurmond. In the collection's central section, Madden turns to issues of sexual difference, community formation, and the place of gay men in contemporary Southern culture. Throughout Madden repeatedly turns to the artifacts that demarcate his memories of youth in the rural South to ask how we define home, how we form meaning out of the silences and losses of the past, and what rituals and relationships might sustain us as we inch forward across a rough terrain of shifting emotional and moral challenges.

In sections of short narratives, she questions our everyday human foibles. Three longer sequences display her admirable reach and fierce intelligence: One, ""The Kudzu Chronicles,"" is a rollicking piece about the transplanted weed. Another, ""Bertha Morisot: Retrospective,"" conjures up a complex life portrait of the French impressionist painter. The third presents fifteen dream songs that virtually out-Berryman Berryman.

When John Ashbery hailed Joan Murray as a major influence in an essay in 2003, her sole collection Poems, had been out of print for decades. Joan Murray hit the literary scene as a bright talent in American poetry just before her death of a heart condition in 1942. She was only in her twenties. After her death, W.H. Auden selected Murray for the 1946 Yale Younger Poets Prize. As she left behind no definitive edition of her work, her Poems was compiled by Grant Code, a close friend of Murray's mother. Code heavily edited the manuscript, often streamlining Murray's raw lyricism, and left out dozens of poems. It had originally been supposed that Murray's original manuscripts had been lost, but a trove of her writings miraculously resurfaced in 2013. In Collected Poems, Farnoosh Fathi has gone through all of Murray's papers and reinstated her visionary lines, while also recovering much previously unpublished verse. An heir to W.B. Yeats, Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, and Laura Riding, Murray today, with her vatic lullabies and mythic imagination, still belongs to the future""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

S. Eliot's The Waste Land, Ezra Pound's early Cantos, and Wallace Stevens's Harmonium as a landmark of modern poetry. But to the chagrin of many admirers, Moore eliminated a third of its contents from her subsequent poetry collections while radically revising some of the poems she retained. This groundbreaking book has been unavailable to the general reader since its original publication in the 1920s. Presented with a new introduction by Linda Leavell, the author of the award-winning biography Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore, this reissue of Observations at last allows readers to experience the untamed force of Moore's most dazzling innovations. Her fellow modernists were thrilled by her originality, her ""clear, flawless"" language--to them she was ""a rafter holding up. our uncompleted building."" Equally forceful for subsequent generations, Observations was an ""eye-opener"" to the young Elizabeth Bishop, its poems ""miracles of language and construction."" John Ashbery has called ""An Octopus"" the finest poem of ""our greatest modern poet."" Moore's heroic open-mindedness and prescient views on multiculturalism, biodiversity, and individual liberty make her work uniquely suited to our times.Impeccably precise yet playfully elusive, emotionally complex but stripped of all sentiment, the poems in Observations show us one of America's greatest poets at the height of her powers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nothing short of a national treasure in France, he is hardly known overseas. In his lifetime, he divided literary opinion with masterpieces that failed to sell and best sellers that caused outrage, trials and even deaths, including his own.

As a musician, he played his trumpet against the advice of cardiologists, sang pacifist songs before audiences of outraged patriots and, in passing, created French rock ?n? roll. Posthumously, he became known for his theatre, film scripts and poetry as well as for his novels. And in May ?68 he became a revolutionary icon.

The world comes alive with A Beauty Collected, a picture book filled with a lush alphabet of artful photography and dreamy narrative. By featuring items that can be found in one's own neighborhood (pinecones, flowers, herbs) combined with more exotic items (raw turquoise nuggets, tentacles, rambutan), the imagery in A Beauty Collected is designed to be accessible and to expand the mind beyond the backyard. Whether the item is a porcupine quill or a vanilla pod, the goal is to encourage inquisitiveness: What is this item? What purpose does it serve? What does it smell or taste like? Where can I find it? By establishing familiarity with nature, A Beauty Collected creates a generation of people who are sensitive to the earth they live on.""--Publisher's description.

The Poetry of Ruan Ji and Xi Kang,"Owen, Stephen",poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL20929462W,/authors/OL893744A/Owen_Stephen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  De Gruyter|Language Chinese|Pages 412,"The poetry of Ruan Ji has been previously translated several times, with one fully scholarly translation of both the poetry and the Fu (poetic expositions). The present translation not only provides a facing page critical Chinese text, it addresses two problems that have been ignored or not adequately treated in earlier works. First, it traces the history of the current text. The rather serious problems with this text will be, if not soluble, at least visible. Second, translations have been shaped by the anachronistic assumption that Ruan Ji was loyal to the declining Wei dynasty, when actual power had been taken by the Suma family, who founded the Jin dynasty after Ruan Ji's death. The introduction shows how and when that assumption took full shape five centuries after Ruan Ji lived and why it is not tenable. This leads to a different kind of translation, closer to what a contemporary reader might have understood and far less certain than referring it to some political event. The Poetry of Xi Kang presents a complete scholarly translation of his poetic works (including ""Rhapsody on the Zither"") alongside the original texts. Many of Xi Kang's poems are difficult and most are laden with allusions and quotations, adding another level of challenge to interpretation. Basic explanatory notes are provided. The translations are based on the critical modern edition of Xi Kang's work by Dai Mingyang, generally considered to be the best edition available. Important editions by Lu Xun and Lu Qinli are consulted on matters of variants, arrangement, and interpretation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The challenging 256-mile route is usually approached from south to north, from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm. He resolved to tackle it the other way round: through beautiful and bleak terrain, across lonely fells and into the howling wind, he would be walking home, towards the Yorkshire village where he was born. Travelling as a ""modern troubadour"" without a penny in his pocket, he stopped along the way to give poetry readings. His audiences varied from the passionate to the indifferent, and his readings were accompanied by drumming rain and bleating sheep.

Here are poems infused with the Third Reich's virulent anti-Semitic slogans, proclamations, and hate-filled speeches calling for the death of the enemy—the Jews. Here is the Yellow Star, marking all Jews for the round-ups, the ghettos, the mass-shootings, and the death trains. From the burning of the books to the burning of the bodies, here is history distilled. One can hear the voices of the bystanders wishing the Jews ""good riddance."" Voices of Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing squads. Voices from the Sonderkommandos in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Voices crying out for help from an indifferent America, an indifferent world. And, here are the shots shots shots echoing through the poems, echoing through time. Today, some seventy years after the Holocaust, we still can't understand. But, the author hopes this collection of Holocaust poems will help us to remember, help us to keep the Holocaust alive, to keep it from falling into mythology.

All the the perils concerned with becoming involved in and maintaining a relationship with the opposite sex. As women, are emotional creatures they sometimes feel that they must have an emotional relationship before     beginning a sexual relationship.While men are usually, more visual and physical by nature.They are turned on by physical contact and visual stuimuli, but women need so much more then that.     Women need emotional and spritual nurturing, while men tend to lack understanding in that area of women’s needs.     When the two come together, this tremedous lack of understanding causes an abundance of pain and heartache. Women are left feeling under-appreciated,neglected and unloved. Men on the other hand, usually don’t undferstand what the problem is in the relationship. We often assume they will not understand; there is also a gap in communication, which futhers the stress we feel.     As a writter I attempt to explain this pain and heartache that women so often go through because of these misunderstandings. But in the end, we MUST eventually turn to a real relationship with God in order to reach the fullest potential that life has to offer.

My mother's legacy,Sarah Hutt,poetry,First published in 1998,/works/OL9741116W,/authors/OL3732481A/Sarah_Hutt,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL18292466M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1998|Publisher  Sarah Hutt|Language English|Pages 80,"My Mother's Legacy"" is a 1,000 line poem wood-burned into the bottom of 1,000 wooden bowls. On each bowl is written a line from my memory that reflects a mannerism, advice, or a remark I attribute to my mother. The bowls are piled randomly onto tables, where the viewer must pick up each bowl to read it. The act of lifting each bowl reminds me of my mother, because she had t he habit of turning things over to see where they were made.    When my mother died of breast cancer in 1965 she was 47 and I was 13. Over the years, I carried around a lot of memory fragments. But I could not fit them together to fully understand who my mother had been as a person. In 1995, to commemorate the anniversary of her death, I began to write down all the things I did remember.    These are the lines that became ""My Mother's Legacy"".  See www.mymotherslegacy.com for more information.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A Pure Exhibit of Ancient Art Part 1 The Forms,Wayde Kenji Brown,poetry,First published in 1990,/works/OL9405513W,/authors/OL3440858A/Wayde_Kenji_Brown,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 1990|Publisher  Vantage Press, 1990","Pondering enigmas of life's encounters and of mortality, poet Wayde Kenji Brown takes an often elegiac tone. At times his verse, collected here under the title: A Pure Exhibit of Ancient Art, Part One: The Poems, seems to contain echoes of Edgar Allan Poe. However, Mr. Brown has his own particular voice, ruminating on losses and at times affirming the confusion of the darker side of life, while at other times celebrating the events and beauties of nature in the form of haiku.       ""Nepenthe and the Necromancy"" tells of the poet's pain and confusion endured as a certain female demon comes to call. ""Mourn the Dead"" is a dirge for a departed love. ""To the Lost Maiden"" relates the poet's hope of being reclaimed from the despair of false beliefs while ""To Jennifer N---"" is a touching tribute to young love, and ""So Long Ago"" narrates a tale of love and regret. ""Screaming Repulsion,"" an encounter between a lady and a demon, presents a terse confrontation between hope and damnation.       These are poems about relationships and the distillation of life experience. Loss and despair are frequently the themes, but sometimes the theme is redemption. Introspective verses that allow readers a glimpse into the poetic mind, they are most evocative, born of rich imagination, sensitivity, and serious thought.

In 1992 Earl S. Braggs won the Anhinga Prize, selected by Marvin Bell, for Hat Dancer Blue. In 1998, supported by a summer fellowship from the University of Tennessee, he travelled to Russia. House on Fontanka is the product of that trip to Russia. Braggs' foreword indicates the tone and context of his new book perfectly: I would remember Langston Hughes' trip to Russia and the Negro in the American South movie, intended but never made. I would remember Claude McKay's speech to the Com-Intern and the book of essays America refused to publish. But he goes on, Braggs writes, to find my love had also grown into the profile of Anna Akmhmatova sitting quietly on the banks of the Black Sea... The pages of this book are crowded by people whom he loves like lost and found brothers and sisters. The pages of this book are flooded by love. Acoridng to the poet's own definition, this book is a 'guided, but unguarded tour' -- Yevgeny Yevtushenko   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

These poems operate on the notion that the lyric can be discovered in scattered headlines, office-wide emails, road signs--the detritus of the everyday. But a poem doesn't stop at found fragments; it creates something from them. These poems question and re-question what can be truthfully said, rediscovering the lyric in the very process of thinking, revising, and re-envisioning""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The thing that makes a poet undertake a particular project is a mystery, finally. One day Shari Wagner was called to understand something, and the journey she decided to take was a meditative one, through the labyrinth of nature and time in a particular place in this world. The result is a gift, this collection of poems. I don't know of a writer, with the exceptions of Gene Stratton-Porter (the subject of several of these poems) or Jessamyn West, who has written with as much care and specificity of Indiana's natural beauty as Wagner does in this book. When Wagner sees an oriole at 10 o'clock in a tree she writes that ""it's like opening / the tab on an advent calendar.""

Seine Texte sind ein nicht abreißender poetischer Gedankenstrom um die großen Fragen der Menschheit, und die Eleganz und die Widerständigkeit ihrer Sprache machen sie, einmal gelesen, zu Lebensbegleitern, die einen immer wieder wie eine geliebte Melodie gefangennehmen. Die Ausgabe wird ergänzt durch eine ausführliche Zeittafel, die einen raschen Überblick über Rilkes Leben und Werk erlaubt. Den Band eröffnet das erste überlieferte Gedicht des achtjährigen René, und er schließt mit seinem letzten, auf dem Sterbebett verfaßten Gedicht. In bisher unerreichter Vollständigkeit werden Rilkes sämtliche Gedichte der Reifezeit geboten und von den Jugendgedichten all jene, die von Rilke zu Zyklen zusammengestellt wurden."" --Publisher description.

Carolina parakeet. Eskimo curlew. Heath hen. In a timely, moving collection of elegies, Holly J. Hughes gives voice to these and other bird species that no longer fill our skies. If their names sound as a litany of the hundreds of species we've lost, these fifteen poems ring as a reminder that their stories are still with us. In clear, well-crafted poems, Hughes serves as witness to these birds' stories, offering each a poignant account that acts as a cautionary tale for the many species whose habitats now face threats from climate change. In her preface, Hughes introduces us to the birds she first knew and loved, and her impassioned afterword reminds us that it's not too late to learn from these birds' extinction and take action to protect the species that remain. ""Take note,"" she writes. ""These birds are singing to us. We must listen.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Oli kerran Haitula...Rännit rämisee / hormit humisee...Nämä säkeet tuovat monille mieleen lapsuuden. Kirjailija Riina Katajavuori on koulukäynneillään nähnyt, että runo nappaa nykyäänkin: ""Lapsilla on automaattisesti ihailtavan mutkaton suhde runoon. Sen rytmi otetaan haltuun, kuunnellaan sisältö ja nautitaan niin kuin lasillinen karpalomehua. Ei jäädä säikähtyneenä kurtistelemaan otsaa.""Leijona se venytteli tarjoilee lastenrunon karpalomehua Suomen itsenäisyyden ensivuosista nykypäivään. Runot on järjestetty osastoihin, jotka kertovat perheestä, leikeistä, ammateista, oppimisesta, matkanteosta, suomalaisuudesta ja vuoden kierrosta luonnossa. Vuosien saatossa runojen kuvaama maailma vaurastuu, kaupungistuu, teknistyy ja kansainvälistyy.Kirjassa ovat edustettuina suomalaisen lastenrunouden huiput Immi Hellenistä ja Lauri Pohjanpäästä Kirsi Kunnakseen ja Jukka Itkoseen. Kaikkiaan runoja on yli 40 tekijältä, myös esikoisrunoilijoilta ja unohtuneilta uranuurtajilta.Oppaana aikamatkalla toimii kuvittaja Maija Hurmeen luoma viisas, sydämellinen ja notkea leijona. Liikuttavat ja humoristiset kuvat avaavat runoihin uusia tasoja ja houkuttelevat löytöretkelle historiaan""-- Page [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With defiance and wild joy, Duan's poems wrestle with and celebrate ancestry and history, racial consciousness, and the growing pains of girlhood. They explore difficult truths with grace and power. I Wore My Blackest Hair is an honest portrait of a woman in-between--identities, places, languages, and desires--and her quest to belong. The speaker is specific in her self-definition, discovering and reinventing what it means to be a bold woman, what it means to be Chinese American, and what it means to grow into adulthood. Duan moves seamlessly from the personal to the imaginative to the universal, heralding a brilliant new voice in contemporary poetry.""--Amazon.com.

In this edition of Mill's essay, Colin Heydt situates the work in its historical context by supplementing the text of the essay with appendices containing excerpts of related works by Mill's predecessors, Mill himself, and prominent critics of his views. The historical richness of this edition of Utilitarianism would surely have pleased Mill, and will surely benefit today's readers."" Ben Eggleston, University of Kansas --  ""Colin Heydt has made judicious choices about which additional readings to place alongside Utilitarianism itself. In addition, his clearly written introduction paints a very plausible and attractive portrait of Mill as a committed moral reformer, albeit one who recognized that the improvement of the received morality must proceed incrementally. This volume is well suited both for introducing Mill to students and as a resource for scholars who would like to have the most pertinent texts in easy reach."" Dale E. Miller, Old Dominion University --  John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism is a philosophical defence of utilitarianism, a moral theory stating that right actions are those that tend to promote overall happiness. The essay first appeared as a series of articles published in Fraser's Magazine in 1861; the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863. Mill discusses utilitarianism in some of his other works, including On Liberty and The Subjection of Women, but Utilitarianism contains his only sustained defence of the theory. --  In this Broadview Edition, Colin Heydt provides a substantial introduction that will enable readers to understand better the polemical context for Utilitarianism. Heydt shows, for example, how Mill's moral philosophy grew out of political engagement, rather than exclusively out of a speculative interest in determining the nature of morality. Appendices include precedents to Mill's work, reactions to Utilitarianism, and related writings by Mill. --Book Jacket.   Read more Read less",31 Want to read|2 Currently reading|5 Have read

Beginning in 2015, the book was adapted as a multi-season TV series, with Dick's daughter, Isa Dick Hackett, serving as one of the show's producers.  Reported inspirations include Ward Moore's alternate Civil War history, Bring the Jubilee (1953), various classic World War II histories, and the I Ching (referred to in the novel). The novel features a ""novel within the novel"" comprising an alternate history within this alternate history wherein the Allies defeat the Axis (though in a manner distinct from the actual historical outcome).

Khleb i volja, ""Bread and Freedom""; Хлеб и воля in contemporary spelling), also known colloquially as The Bread Book, is an 1892 book by the Russian anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin. Originally written in French, it first appeared as a series of articles in the anarchist journal Le Révolté. It was first published in Paris with a preface by Élisée Reclus, who also suggested the title. Between 1892 and 1894, it was serialized in part in the London journal Freedom, of which Kropotkin was a co-founder.  In the work, Kropotkin points out what he considers to be the defects of the economic systems of feudalism and capitalism and why he believes they thrive on and maintain poverty and scarcity. He goes on to propose a more decentralized economic system based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation, asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in evolution and in human society.  The Conquest of Bread has become a classic of political anarchist literature. It was heavily influential on both the Spanish Civil War and the Occupy movement.

It is one of the major early historical works on the French Revolution. In this book, de Tocqueville develops his main theory about the French revolution, the theory of continuity, in which he states that even though the French tried to dissociate themselves from the past and from the autocratic old regime, they eventually reverted to a powerful central government.

Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in her time—Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia—which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.

Oppenheimer wrote the book in Frankfurt am Main during 1907, as a fragment of the four-volume System of Sociology, an intended interpretative framework for the understanding of social evolution on which he laboured from the 1890s until the end of his life. The work summarizes Oppenheimer’s general theory on the origin, development and future transformation of the state. The State, which Oppenheimer’s missionary zeal pervades, was widely read and passionately discussed in the early 20th century. It was well received by—and influential on—as diverse an audience as Zionist settlers in Palestine (halutzim), American and Slavic communitarians, West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, and anarcho-capitalists like Murray Rothbard.

Huxley opens the book by allowing the reader to eavesdrop on the tour of the fertilizing Room of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning center, where the high tech reproduction takes place. One of the characters, Bernard Marx, seems alone, harboring an ill-defined longing to break free. Satirical and disturbing, Brave New World is set some 600 years into the future. Reproduction is controlled through genetic engineering, and people are bred into a rigid class system.

In Memo to the President Elect, former secretary of state and bestselling author Madeleine Albright offers provocative ideas about how to confront the striking array of challenges that the next commander-in-chief will face and how to return America to its rightful role as a source of inspiration across the globe.Much more than a set of policy prescriptions, Secretary Albright's writing blends lessons from the past with forward-looking suggestions about how to assemble a first-rate foreign policy team, anticipate the actions of other key countries, make full use of presidential power without repeating the excesses of the Bush administration, and revive America's commitment to its founding ideals.Albright's advice is candid—as conveyed in a confidential memo—and seasoned with humor and stories from her years in office. Drawing on her extensive experience as an advisor to two presidents and a key figure in four presidential transitions, she provides an insider's analysis of U.S. options in addressing the decisive issues of our era: terrorism, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rivalries in the Middle East, the potential for nuclear war, and headaches created by such troublesome leaders as Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, and North Korea's Kim Jong-il.The 2008 election promises to be one of the most dramatic in our nation's history. Memo to the President Elect offers indispensable guidance for the next occupant of the White House—and a wealth of insights for voters to think about before deciding who that person will be.

Published in the U.S. in 1899 and 1900 in the U.K., the novel’s subtitle, A Tale of the Revolution in Laurania, reflects the story’s modern political focus. Savrola contains the seeds of Churchill’s exceptional talents as a statesman, a political philosopher, and a man of literature. The ambition of Savrola to rule foreshadows Churchill’s own life-long career as the greatest democratic leader of the past century. In the novel, Churchill the thinker explores the challenges of securing democratic order and avoiding mob rule. He sketches a model of the education needed for modern statesmanship and describes the kind of rhetoric that appeals to a modern democratic people. Elements of Churchill’s literary style in the novel anticipate the greatness of his later prose works that would merit him the Nobel Prize for Literature.  Laurania, a long-established republic, is subjected to the autocratic rule of President Antonio Molara, a former general who has become known as the Dictator. Savrola, the man of the multitude, leads the democratic effort to restore the political liberties of the people. When the register of eligible electors is mutilated and the popular franchise compromised, a riot breaks out and the stage is set for a fight to the death between Molara and Savrola over who will rule Laurania. General Molara enlists the assistance of his beautiful wife, Lucille, to undermine Savrola’s influence with the people. But Lucille falls in love with Savrola, who is equally moved by the beauty and charm of the First Lady. As is indicated by the last chapter’s title, ""Life’s Compensations,"" all ends well in Laurania. After the violent troubles of the revolution, Molara is dead, Lucille and Savrola are united, and the Mediterranean republic returns to peace and prosperity.

Chomsky compila, en este libro, una serie de discursos que realizó durante la primavera de 2002, y una entrevista. Su nacionalidad estadounidense no le impide juzgar la política y la moral de su país con los mismos ojos que los Estados Unidos usan para mirar y juzgar a las otras naciones.  Después de su anterior libro 11/09/2001, publicado en RBA, recibido con entusiasmo tanto por parte de la crítica como de los lectores, Noam Chomsky insta de nuevo a una reflexión sobre los más terribles efectos del poder norteamericano ejercido, demasiado a menudo, de manera tiránica.

Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status - much like their grandparents before them.  In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America:  we have simply redesigned it.  Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community - and all of us - to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.

A theory of justice,John Rawls,political_science,First published in 1971,/works/OL30310W?edition=ia%3Atheoryofjustice00rawl,/authors/OL27530A/John_Rawls,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21160715M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1971|Publisher  Belknap Press|Language English|Pages 607,"The principles of justice Rawls set forth in this book are those that free and rational people would accept in an initial position of equality. In this hypothetical situation, which corresponds to the state of nature in social contract theory, no one knows his or her place in society; his or her class position or social status; his or her fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities; his or her intelligence, strength, and the like; or even his or her conception of the good. Thus, deliberating behind a veil of ignorance, people determine their rights and duties. The first section of A Theory of Justice addresses objections to the theory and discusses alternative positions, especially utilitarianism. Rawls then applies his theory to the  philosophical basis of constitutional liberties, the problem of distributive justice, and the grounds and limits of political duty and obligation. He includes here a discussion of civil disobedience and conscientious objection. Finally, he connects his theory of justice with a doctrine of the good and of moral development. This enables him to formulate a conception of society as a social union of social unions, and to use his theory of justice to explain the values of community. Since its first appearance in 1971, A Theory of Justice has been continuously taught and debated, and translated into twenty-four languages. This revised edition includes changes, discussed in the preface, which Rawls considered to be significant, especially to the discussions of liberty and primary social goods. - Back cover.

Jules Witcover, who has covered every election since 1952, here combines unparalleled knowledge about presidential politics with a scintillating, wise analysis of what's wrong with the way American presidents are chosen. He shows us, in memorable and dramatic detail, how professional mercenaries--with little party loyalty and diminished political principles, driven by skewed priorities and an insatiable need for money, are corrupting American public life. At the same time, he shows how television dramatically, even destructively, distorts the election process, discouraging voter participation and dissuading some of our most promising public figures from seeking higher office. In this lively, story-filled account, Witcover examines the many ways in which politicians themselves have condoned or encouraged these developments and how they are responding to the new demands of a media-driven, money-conscious age. He assessses the effects of campaign funds, both ""soft"" and ""hard, and of a press corps that practices invasive, ""gotcha"" journ   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Lucas reveals the asymmetrical relationship between Russia and the West, a result of the fact that Russia is prepared to use armed force whenever necessary, while the West is not. Hard-hitting and powerful, The New Cold War is a sobering look at Russia's current aggression and what it means for the world.--Publisher's description.

Marxist analyses tend to presuppose European models of history and experience that downplay the significance of black people and black communities as agents of change and resistance. Black radicalism must be linked to the traditions of Africa and the unique experiences of blacks on western continents, Robinson argues, and any analyses of African American history need to acknowledge this.  To illustrate his argument, Robinson traces the emergence of Marxist ideology in Europe, the resistance by blacks in historically oppressive environments, and the influence of both of these traditions on such important twentieth-century black radical thinkers as W. E. B. Du Bois, C. L. R. James, and Richard Wright.   Read more Read less",12 Want to read|0 Currently reading|3 Have read

And they all must contend with an underclass that is beginning to ask a few too many questions, aided by a man called Loony Luke and his very persuasive pet alien.  In classic Philip K. Dick fashion, The Simulacra combines time travel, psychotherapy, telekinesis, androids, and Neanderthal-like mutants to create a rousing, mind-bending story where there are conspiracies within conspiracies and nothing is ever what it seems.

The United States is in the process of staking out not just the globe, but the last unarmed spot in our neighbourhood - the skies - as a militarized sphere of influence. Our earth and its skies are, for the Bush administration, the final frontiers of imperial control. In Hegemony or Survival, Noam Chomsky explains how we came to this moment, what kind of peril we find ourselves in, and why our rulers are willing to jeopardize the future of our species. In our era, Chomsky argues, empire is a recipe for an earthly wasteland.   Read more Read less",32 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

Within days the barbed-wire entanglement would undergo an extraordinary metamorphosis: it became an imposing 103-mile-long wall guarded by three hundred watchtowers. A physical manifestation of the struggle between Soviet Communism and American capitalism—totalitarianism and freedom—that would stand for nearly thirty years, the Berlin Wall was the high-risk fault line between East and West on which rested the fate of all humanity. Many brave people risked their lives to overcome this lethal barrier, and some paid the ultimate price.In this captivating work, sure to be the definitive history on the subject, Frederick Taylor weaves together official history, archival materials and personal accounts to tell the complete story of the Wall's rise and fall, from the postwar political tensions that created a divided Berlin to the internal and external pressures that led to the Wall's demise. In addition, he explores the geopolitical ramifications as well as the impact the wall had on ordinary lives that is still felt today. For the first time the entire world faced the threat of imminent nuclear apocalypse, a fear that would be eased only when the very people the Wall had been built to imprison breached it on the historic night of November 9, 1989.Gripping and authoritative, The Berlin Wall is the first comprehensive account of a divided city and its people in a time when the world seemed to stand permanently on the edge of destruction.

In bold, highly readable fashion, he re-examines traditional democratic ideals-- freedom of speech, free public education, the enjoyment of private property, and other issues of vital concern to freedom-loving peoples all over the world.  Mr. Lippmann believes that democratic procedures can be safeguarded only by a strong central government, unafraid of the power of mass opinion.  Men will continue to be free, he says, only if they elect officials who cannot be bribed, appeased, or intimidated by private groups, but who sill govern according to the public philosophy, or those principles of unselfish behavior which formed the basis of the U. S. Constitution.  Here is an imaginative, Philosophically-grounded discussion which urges every democratic citizen to place the good of his fellow man above personal interest in order to preserve democracy at large, and is own individual liberty.

But after decades of vicious infighting and partisan gridlock in the New Republic Senate, that hope seems like a distant memory.  Now a respected senator, Leia must grapple with the dangers that threaten to cripple that fledging democracy—from both within and without. Underworld kingpins, treacherous politicians, and Imperial loyalists are sowing chaos in the galaxy. Desperate to take action, senators are calling for the election of a First Senator. It is their hope that this influential post will bring strong leadership to a divided galaxy.  As the daughter of Darth Vader, Leia faces with distrust the prospect of any one person holding such a powerful position—even when supporters suggest Leia herself for the job.

This series of essays examines the dark side of democracy in contemporary India. It looks closely at how religious majoritarianism, cultural nationalism, and neo-fascism simmer just under the surface of a country that projects itself as the world's largest democracy.Roy writes about how the combination of Hindu Nationalism and India's neo-liberal economic reforms which began their journey together in the early 1990s are now turning India into a police state. She describes the systematic marginalization of religious and ethnic minorities, the rise of terrorism, and the massive scale of displacement and dispossession of the poor by predatory corporations. She also offers a brilliant account of the August 2008 uprising of the people of Kashmir against India's military occupation and an analysis of the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai.

Brilliant, entertaining and highly satisfying, this is my favorite of the collaborations between Frederick Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth.     This is sharp satire of the consumer society and corporate corruption of government is as relevant today as when it was first published in the golden age of science fiction. ""Gladiator at law"" describes a possible future for the then-distant 1950s in which the working and middle classes are kept under control by the threat of losing their job and with it their tied housing--and the unemployed masses are kept quiescent with bread and circuses, Roman style. Reality tv may not have gone quite as far as the entertainment for the proles depicted in this novel, and science fiction is an exploration of possible futures rather than a prediction of an actual future, but Pohl and Kornbluth's depiction of one of those potential futures is uncomfortably close to present day reality.  There are some nicely drawn characters, and a realistic look at the hazards of battling powerful vested interests -- while there is a happy ending, it comes at a price.

Then the jury of public opinion decides. It likes the proposals or actions or it does not. It trusts the actors or it doesn't. It moves, always at the margin, and then those who benefit from the movement are declared winners. This book is about that public opinion response. Its most basic premise is that although pubic opinion rarely matters in a democracy, public opinion change is the exception. Public opinion rarely matters, because the public rarely cares enough to act on its concerns or preferences. Change happens only when the threshold of normal public inattention is crossed. When public opinion changes, governments rise or fall, elections are won or lost, old realities give way to new demands.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Noam Chomsky is universally accepted as one of the preeminent public intellectuals of the modern era. Over the past thirty years, broadly diverse audiences have gathered to attend his sold-out lectures. Now, in Understanding Power, Peter Mitchell and John Schoeffel have assembled the best of Chomsky's recent talks on the past, present, and future of the politics of power. In a series of enlightening and wide-ranging discussions, all published here for the first time, Chomsky radically reinterprets the events of the past three decades, covering topics from foreign policy during Vietnam to the decline of welfare under the Clinton administration. And as he elucidates the connection between America's imperialistic foreign policy and the decline of domestic social services, Chomsky also discerns the necessary steps to take toward social change. With an eye to political activism and the media's role in popular struggle, as well as U.S. foreign and domestic policy, Understanding Power offers a sweeping critique of the world around us and is definitive Chomsky.

Los experimentos totalitarios del siglo xx ampliaron este uso de la violencia, a una escala y una intensidad inéditas en la historia de la humanidad, y es en este contexto donde cabe encuadrar esta obra perenne de Hannah Arendt. Para la filosofía política, la violencia objeto de su estudio tiene dos caras: la violencia organizada del Estado o aquella que irrumpe frente al mismo. Esto ha hecho que muchos pensasen que la violencia es sobre todo una forma de ejercicio del poder. La posición de partida de la autora en ""Sobre la violencia"" consiste en el estudio minucioso de la violencia política en sus encarnaciones extremas dentro del mundo contemporáneo y en su cuidadosa separación entre violencia y poder político; este último es el resultado de la acción cooperativa, mientras que la violencia del siglo XX está ligada al alcance magnificador de la destrucción que proporciona la tecnología.

It proposes nothing less than a completely new basis for international law. As relevant today as when it was first published nearly sixty years ago, it commands the attention of all concerned with what the future may bring to the law of nations. The great scope of Niemeyer's undertaking draws respect even from those who disagree with his challenging analysis of the historical past and his suggestions for the future of international law. In his new introduction, Michael Henry observes that Law Without Force provides us with a foundation of Niemeyer's thinking. Published in 1941, when Hitler was swallowing up Europe, this volume shows how a first-rate mind grappled with a legal, historical, social, and ultimately metaphysical problem. It provides in detail the reasoning behind Niemeyer's rejection of a foreign policy based on morality and his distinction between authoritarian and totalitarian governments; and it provides us with the first stage of his lengthy and prodigious effort to understand ""this terrible century."" It is a book that no serious student of Niemeyer can afford to ignore. At the very heart of the author's vigorous discussion may be found his rejection of a moral basis for international law and his suggestion that a functional basis should be substituted for it. The book incisively reviews the relation between traditional international law and the changing structure of international politics concluding that the traditional system of law has operated as an agency of disharmony and conflict. After an investigation of the traditional legal system, the author then asks, ""What type of law fits the social structure of this modern world?"" The answers are presented in the last part of the book, as Neimeyer offers his case for a functional system of law, divorced from moral exhortations or appeals to shattered authority. Philosophy, sociology, and legal theory are brilliantly interwoven in this volume, which will engage serious readers interested in political and social theory.""--Provided by publisher.

Indeed, the book actually helped shape that history. Published in 1955, a year after the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ordered schools desegregated, Strange Career was cited so often to counter arguments for segregation that Martin Luther King, Jr. called it ""the historical Bible of the civil rights movement."" The book offers a clear and illuminating analysis of the history of Jim Crow laws, presenting evidence that segregation in the South dated only to the 1890s. Woodward convincingly shows that, even under slavery, the two races had not been divided as they were under the Jim Crow laws of the 1890s. In fact, during Reconstruction, there was considerable economic and political mixing of the races. The segregating of the races was a relative newcomer to the region.    Hailed as one of the top 100 nonfiction works of the twentieth century, The Strange Career of Jim Crow has sold almost a million copies and remains, in the words of David Herbert Donald, ""a landmark in the history of American race relations.""

She wrote about men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don't, about why this arises, and how this aspect of the gender wars works, airing some of her own hilariously awful encounters. She ends on a serious note-- because the ultimate problem is the silencing of women who have something to say, including those saying things like, ""He's trying to kill me!"" This book features that now-classic essay with six perfect complements, including an examination of the great feminist writer Virginia Woolf 's embrace of mystery, of not knowing, of doubt and ambiguity, a highly original inquiry into marriage equality, and a terrifying survey of the scope of contemporary violence against women   Read more Read less",83 Want to read|0 Currently reading|26 Have read

Pat Ahluwalia contends that post-colonial theory has marginalised a huge part of its constituency, namely Africa. This book fills a significant gap. Moreover, he argues that if post-colonial theory is to have any major and lasting effect within social and political theory, it needs to engage with matters overtly political. Eurocentric theory has failed to understand post-colonial Africa: Politics and Post-Colonial Theory traces how African identity has been constituted and reconstituted by examining movements such as negritude, and the rise of nationalism and decolonisation. The book questions how helpful postcolonial analysis can be in understanding the complexities which define institutions such as the nation-state, civil society, human rights and citizenship. Finally, the book examines the relevance of globalisation to both post-colonialism, as well as Africa, and looks at the ways in which Africa and Africans are now reconstituting their identity in order to meet the challenges of everyday life. It illustrates how Africa and Africans transform and inflect the institutions inherited as a result of colonialism.Politics and Post-Colonial Theory bravely breaks down disciplinary boundaries. Its radical vision will be essential reading for all those engaged in post-colonial studies, African studies, literary theory, and political and social sciences in general.

Jedoch nicht die Gefahr des internationalen Terrorismus hat diese Entwicklung verursacht, sondern eine Politik der US-Regierung, die das Völkerrecht ignoriert, die Vereinten Nationen an den Rand drängt und den Bruch mit Europa in Kauf nimmt. Die Spaltung zieht sich auch durch Europa und Amerika selbst hindurch. In Deutschland wirkt die Abkehr der amerikanischen Administration und der Eliten von ihren eigenen Traditionen wie ein Lackmustest. Heute zerfällt die chemische Verbindung, aus der die Westorientierung der Bundesrepublik seit Adenauer bestanden hat, in ihre beiden Elemente: opportunistische Anpassung an die hegemoniale Macht trennt sich von intellektueller und moralischer Bindung an die Prinzipien einer westlichen Kultur.  Auch im Jahr seines 75. Geburtstages erweist sich der politische Denker Habermas wieder als brillanter Analytiker und Stichwortgeber der Republik und des europäischen Geistes. Der gespaltene Westen versammelt Beiträge, die infolge der Ereignisse vom 11. September 2001 entstanden, darunter der neue, weitausgreifende Essay über die Zukunft des Kantischen Projekts einer weltbürgerlichen Ordnung.

It explores the key anarchist concepts of society and the state, freedom and equality, authority and power, and investigates the successes and failure of the anarchist movements throughout the world. While remaining sympathetic to anarchism, it presents a balanced and critical account. It covers not only the classic anarchist thinkers, such as Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus and Emma Goldman, but also other libertarian figures, such as Nietzsche, Camus, Gandhi, Foucault and Chomsky.

This book is the first full length study in English to present his political thought to a wider audience, beyond that of his followers and sympathisers, and to bring into the open the study of a neglected strand of contemporary Western thought, that of traditionalism. Evola deserves more attention because he is an influential writer. His following comes from an important if largely ignored political movement: activists and commentators whose political positions are, like his, avowedly traditionalist, authoritarian, anti-modern, anti-democratic and anti-liberal. With honourable exceptions, contemporary academic study tends to treat these groups as a minority within a minority, a sub-species of Fascism, from whom they are held to derive their ideas and their support. This work seeks to bring out more clearly the complexity of Evolas post-war strategy, so as to explain how he can be adopted both by the neo-fascist groups committed to violence, and by groups such as the European New Right whose approach is more aimed at influence from within liberal democracies. Furlong also recognises the relevance of Evolas ideas to anti-globalisation arguments, including a re-examination of his arguments for detachment and spontaneism (apolitia)""--  ""Julius Evola's writing covered a vast range of subjects, from a distinctive and categorical ideological outlook and has been extremely influential on a significant number of extreme right thinkers, activists and organisations.

But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forced into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of America's vast inequality--and to people's determination and intelligence in the face of hardship. Based on years of embedded fieldwork and painstakingly gathered data, this masterful book transforms our understanding of extreme poverty and economic exploitation while providing fresh ideas for solving a devastating, uniquely American problem. Its unforgettable scenes of hope and loss remind us of the centrality of home, without which nothing else is possible""--Publisher's website.

AWOL: The Unexcused Absence of America's Upper Classes from Military Service -- and How It Hurts Our Country,Frank Schaeffer,political_science,First published in 2006,/works/OL15080352W?edition=ia%3Aawolunexcusedabs00scha,/authors/OL2630889A/Frank_Schaeffer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24275668M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  HarperCollins|Language English,"Military service was once taken for granted as a natural part of good citizenship, and Americans of all classes served during wartime.Not anymore.As Kathy Roth-Douquet and Frank Schaeffer assert in this groundbreaking work, there is a glaring disconnect between the ""all volunteer military"" and the rest of us. And as that gap between the cultural ""elite"" and military rank-and-file widens, our country faces a dangerous lack of understanding between those in power and those who defend our way of life.In America, it is increasingly the case that the people who make, support, or protest military policy have no military experience. As a result, the privileged miss the benefits of military service — leadership, experience helpful to their future roles in public life, and exposure to a broader cross section of citizens — while the military feels under-supported and morally distanced from the rest of the country. And when only a handful of members of Congress have military experience or a personal link to someone in uniform, perhaps it becomes too easy (or too hard) to send the military into combat.Based on research and including the voices of many young military members who understand firsthand the value of service, AWOL is also a very personal book. Frank Schaeffer, father of a former enlisted Marine, knows the anguish and pride that millions of American parents feel every day as their children are off fighting a war in a foreign land. Kathy Roth-Douquet, wife of a career officer, has experienced the struggle of trying to keep the family together with a husband at war as well as the often untold satisfaction of raising children in an ethic of service. To the authors and numerous other families who are intimately acquainted with the glory and the sacrifice of military service, America needs a wake-up call before it's too late.

The book focuses on a selection of case-studies drawn from events in the Habsburg, Romanov and Ottoman Empires, as well as the nation-states that arose form their break-up during, and in the aftermath of the First World War. It proposes that the events of the war itself catapulted nationalist movements into positions of authority well before the necessary cultural and institutional framework had had time to develop. The resulting crisis of political modernisation has reemerged in the late twentieth century and has been a fundamental threat to global stability.Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empire includes examination of: the role of intelligentsias the effect of WW1 on the peoples of multi ethnic empires the conflicts over how to define the boundaries of nationhood in the new post-war polities the role of institutional continuity and the old elites in the evolution of the new nation states.

Yet America is no stranger to terrorism. Since 1950 there have been around three thousand terrorist attacks, ranging from the Ku Klux Klan's campaign of terror against the civil rights movement, through the waves of attacks by the neo-nazi Aryan resistance, to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network. Christopher Hewitt's comprehensive book surveys the characteristics and causes of terrorism, and governmental responses to it. He also examines the organizational structure of terrorist networks, how they are financed, and their ideological agendas. Groups covered include: Islamic fundamentalists, white and black racists, black nationalists, revolutionary communists, neo-Nazis, militant Jewish groups, anti-abortionists and emigre groups. This book is essential reading for students of American politics and terrorism. It also provides a highly readable account for interested readers wishing to know more about a topic which has recently become tragically relevant to world affairs.

In the work Lifton details the medical procedures occurring before and during the Holocaust and explores the paradoxical theme of healing killing in which one race was healed by eliminating another; a concept that many used to morally justify their actions. Throughout the book, Lifton provides quotes from interviews he conducted with SS doctors and with victims.  The book was awarded the 1987 Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the 1987 National Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category.

But each has called for $1 trillion in tax increases over the next ten years—and dressed them up as tax cuts!Mainstream Media has been given marching orders from the Society of Professional Journalists: never refer to ""Islamic terrorists"" or ""Muslim terrorists."" And they are obeying! Whenever our brave agents disrupt a terror plot, The media dismisses the culprits as a gang of idiots—lulling us into a false sense of security.If the liberals win the 2008 election, they will cripple talk radio—forcing stations to give equal time to left-wing programs, and insisting that liberals play a key role in station management.Up to a quarter of all state pension funds in the United States are invested in companies that are helping Iran, Syria, North Korea, or the Sudan—for a total of nearly $200 billion.The Do-Nothing Congress is still doing nothing—and the worst offenders are the presidential candidates Clinton, Obama, and McCain, who never show up for their day jobs as senators...except to pick up their $165,000 paycheck!Is it any wonder that Americans feel fleeced at every turn?As more and more critical problems develop that need national attention, the White House and Congress appear to be AWOL.Who's calling the shots instead?Big business, big government, big labor, and big lobbyists. And their self-serving agendas are doing nothing to help the ever-increasing number of American people who are losing their homes, paying credit card interest rates higher than 25 percent, and finding their jobs increasingly outsourced to foreign countries.In this hard-hitting call to arms, Dick Morris and Eileen McGann reveal the hundreds of ways American tax-payers are routinely fleeced—by our own government; by foreign countries like Dubai that are gobbling up American interests and spending millions to influence government decisions and American public opinion; by Washington lobbying firms that are pushing the agendas of corrupt foreign dictators on Capitol Hill; and by hedge-fund billionaires collecting huge tax breaks courtesy of the IRS.With their characteristic blend of sharp analysis and insider insight, Morris and McGann call offenders of all kinds on the carpet—and offer practical agendas we all can follow to help turn the tide.

National Identity and Geopolitical Visions locates myths of national identity, both popular and elite, and analyses their value in creating pride, deflecting fear and legimizing aggression. An extraordinary range of essays - on Britain, the United States, Germany, Russia, Iraq, Serbia, Argentina, Australia and India - illustrates the different manifestations of the geographical imagination across the countries of the world. Together, these essays reveal what is most enduring in these visions and how they continue to shape the world at the end of the Twentieth Century.

As a result, government policies have largely ignored the growth in income inequality caused by technological change and economic globalization. This omission has been tolerated because most Americans do not support interventionist government policies. They believe that the government serves the interests of the campaign donors rather than the public. This skepticism concerning the public sector's fairness must be overcome before effective programs to offset mounting inequality can be implemented. Though in recent years legislation to reform the financing of political campaigns has been adopted, private wealth continues to dominate the political process. Political cynicism therefore persists.

Our civilization has turned into entertainment, gossip, enjoyment, and has adopted a carefree, devil-may-care attitude, ignoring what is happening as long as it has its fix of soccer, bull fighting, baseball, cheap entertainment, talk shows, irresponsible yellow journalism, and exploitation of the poor.  The idea is: have fun, keep boredom at bay, and avoid what bothers, worries and anguishes us. In fact modern culture makes it a social mandate.

Focusing on sending states’ engagement in the area of social protection, this book shows how a series of emigration-related policies that go beyond the realm of social security address the needs of nationals abroad in the area of health care, unemployment, family benefits, pensions and economic hardship. In addition, this volume highlights the variety of sending states’ institutions that are involved in these policies (consulates, diaspora institutions, ministries, agencies…) and their engagement with citizens abroad in other policy areas such as electoral rights, citizenship, language, culture, education, business or religion. As such this book is a valuable read to researchers, policy makers, government employees and NGO’s.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is unique in clearly describing and analysing all three existing models of democracy: participatory democracy; referenda and initiatives; and representative of liberal democracy. Using numerous real life examples from all over the world, this text explores how each is used in practice and provides discussion of the main problems with each model. It also examines the strengths and weaknesses of the main voting systems. The book concludes by considering the merits of the three models of democracy and looks at how the level of democratic control can be increased in the future. Two themes run through the book: the diversity of democratic practice; and the extent to which people have power over decisions that affect their lives.  The challenge for democracy in the 21st Century is not how democracy is achieved but which decisions are taken democratically and which group of people participates.

Conventional histories of political thought have sometimes relegated feminist thinking to the footnotes. This text considers how feminism is central to key notions of modern political discourse such as autonomy, liberty and equality, and feminist discussions of morality have been linked to major currents in political thought such as republicanism, civic humanism and romanticism. This collection of essays aims to show that feminism is not a variant of modern radical discourse but is a mode of analyzing the issues of authority, power and virtue that have been at the heart of European political thought from the Middle Ages.

The Routledge Handbook of Southeast Asian Democratization provides a comprehensive overview of the development of democracy in the region and shows that political and structural factors differ strikingly across countries. Combining theory and case studies, it is structured in three major sections: Social segments and change processes - Institutions - Country cases and democratic guises. Contributing to on-going debates in the field, this interdisciplinary reference work explores the value systems, social structures and institutions which can affect democratization. At the same time, it tracks the pattern of fragile unfolding and gradual stabilization of democracy, as well as its resultant cost, rollback or even breakdown in the region. Bringing together over 25 key international experts in the field, this cutting-edge Handbook is designed to disaggregate, then order, the many variables that punctuate Southeast Asia's socio-political and economic terrain, and to produce a detailed account of the mixed fortunes of democracy in the region""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It takes a comparative approach the authors examine the concept of integrated national maritime policy (INMP), analysing its application in four countries Australia, Canada, UK and USA and discussing at length how it might be applied to Saudi Arabia""--  ""Because marine governance in most countries is sectoral, maritime policies are frequently fragmented, reactive, and even contradictory, meaning that marine resources are underutilized and poorly protected. To avoid these problems, the concept of integrated national maritime policy (INMP) has been developed. This book examines this concept, analysing its current application in four countries - Australia, Canada, UK and USA - whilst discussing at length how it might be applied to Saudi Arabia. Based on extensive fieldwork carried out in Saudi Arabia - including interviews with officials in government departments with maritime responsibilities, and a survey administered to 230 stakeholders - the book offers a unique insight into IMP in the Kingdom. The book provides a practical template for the building of the political will and civil constituency in Saudi Arabia necessary for the introduction of INMP. In setting out in detail its benefits, this book could help build the momentum in Saudi Arabia required to implement the concept as well as attract other countries to do the same. A significant contribution to the growing literature on ocean governance, this book will be of great importance to policy makers and scholars of Middle Eastern studies, marine governance and comparative politics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Spatiality, sovereignty and Carl Schmitt",Stephen Legg,political_science,First published in 2011,/works/OL15999262W?edition=ia%3Aspatialitysovere0000unse,/authors/OL3692738A/Stephen_Legg,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24903441M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 306,"""The writings of Carl Schmitt (1888-1985) are now indissociable from both an historical period and a contemporary moment. He will forever be remembered for his association with the National Socialists of 1930s Germany, and as the figure whose writings on sovereignty, politics, and the law provided justification for authoritarian, decisional states. Yet at the same time, the post-September  2001 world is one in which a wide range of scholars have increasingly turned to Schmitt to understand a world of ""with us or against us"" Manichaeism, spaces of exception which seem to be placed outside the law by legal mechanisms themselves, and the contestation of a uni-polar, post-1989 world. This attention marks out Schmitt as one of the foremost emerging theorists in critical theory and assures his work a large and growing audience. The aim of this book is to bring together geographers, and Schmitt experts who are attuned to the spatial dimensions of his work, to discuss The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum (Schmitt, 1950 [2003]). This longest of Schmitts published works saw him expand his interests from domestic to international law""--  ""This work brings together geographers, and Schmitt experts who are attuned to the spatial dimensions of his work, to discuss his 1950 work The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum. Explaining the growing audience for Schmitt's work, a broad range of contributors also examine the Nomos in relation to broader debates about enmity and war, the production of space, the work of Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben, and the recuperability of such an intellect tainted by its anti-Semitism and links to the Nazi party. This work will be of great interest to researchers in political theory, socio-legal studies, geopolitics and critical IR theory""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The New York Times now publishes FiveThirtyEight.com, where Silver is one of the nation’s most influential political forecasters.  Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.  In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.  Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.  With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.

He interweaves with great dexterity motifs that extend from his early works, such as Nietzsche and Philosophy, to the more recent What is Philosophy? and his key works such as Anti-Oedipus and Difference and Repetition. Throughout, Deleuze and the Political demonstrates Deleuze's relevance to theoretical and practical concerns in a number of disciplines including philosophy, political theory, sociology, history, and cultural studies.Paul Patton also presents an outstandingly clear treatment of fundamental concepts in Deleuze's work, such as difference, power, desire, multiplicities, nomadism and the war machine and sets out the importance of Deleuze to poststructuralist political thought.It will be essential reading for anyone studying Deleuze and students of philosophy, politics, sociology, literature and cultural studies.

One is that of a decaying Leninist hierarchy and the other of a likely democratizing nation destined for liberal pluralism; this book, on the other hand, provides a balanced assessment of China’s communist rule, its viability as well as its prospect of democracy.  The People’s Congresses and Governance in China presents a complex but convincing analysis of the transformation of governance in China. As the first systemic and theoretical study of China’s provincial legislatures, it draws our attention to one of the most promising growth points in China’s changing constitutional order. Through in-depth and first-hand research, the author provides a comprehensive explanation about why the provincial legislatures have acquired institutional maturation and expanded power in the context of Chinese transitional political economy. The book portrays an innovative pattern of legislative development, sums up pragmatic local strategies for market creation, and identifies multiple dynamics for promoting accountability and democracy. Based upon the case study of provincial legislatures, the author reveals the formation of a new mode of governance in China’s national politics: the network structure featuring institutional arrangements and the mohe (co-operation through competition) pattern of interaction abided by the major power players.  Adding the biggest legislative system to our understanding of representational institutions, this book will be of interest to parliamentary scholars and parliamentarians who are concerned with the role of parliaments in transitional politics and economies of both post-communist and developing countries. It will also appeal to students and researchers of Chinese politics, governance, and Asian studies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The clearest, boldest and most systematic statement of Simon Critchley’s influential views on philosophy, ethics, and politics, Infinitely Demanding identifies a massive political disappointment at the heart of liberal democracy. Arguing that what is called for is an ethics of commitment that can inform a radical politics, Critchley considers the possibility of political subjectivity and action after Marx and Marxism, taking in the work of Kant, Levinas, Badiou and Lacan. Infinitely Demanding culminates in an argument for anarchism as an ethical practice and a remotivating means of political organization.

One day, the Reverend Hornswell Hake had nothing worse to contend with than the customary power shortages and his routine pastoral chores, such as counseling the vivacious Alys Brant -- and her husbands and wife.  At nearly forty, his life was placid, almost humdrum.  The very next day, Horny Hake was first enlisted as an unwilling agent of the Team -- secret successor to the long-discredited CIA -- and then courted by an anti-Team underground group.  In practically no time at all, Horny and Alys were touring Europe on a mission about which he knew zip, except that it was a new move in the Cool War, the worldwide campaign of sabotage that had replaced actual combat.  For the team and its opponents, though, the Cool War could be as perilous as any hot one, as Horny Hake discovered when he came up against   Leota, lovely leader of the underground cabal, dedicated to destroying the Team;   Yosper, the Bible-thumping, foul-mouthed nonogenarian killer;   The Reddi twins, professional terrorists who turned up in the oddest places at the worst times and always managed to make Horny's life miserable;   Ane Pegleg, master of such lethal toys as the Bulgarian Brolly and the Peruvian Pen.    Picaresque and fast-moving, THE COOL WAR is also a deeply ironic, often hilarious, yet thought-provoking look at where we could be, some forty years from now.

The author offers a critical analysis of Arab aid in general through the lens of International Relations theories (mainly Constructivism and Rationalism), as well as an in-depth study of the UAE's foreign aid programme. Using the case studies of Palestine and Pakistan, the focus moves beyond the UAE to show how cultural factors have impacted on the behaviour of the authorities across the wider Arab Middle East.Adopting a new approach to how this particular case is examined and researched, this book will be of particular interest to students, researchers and academics interested in Middle East studies, the Gulf States, Middle East politics, and foreign aid and foreign policy""--  ""This book offers a concise and detailed analysis of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) foreign aid as a main instrument in its foreign policy.

Axworthy explains how that outpouring of support for an end to tyranny in Iran paused and then moved on to other areas in the region like Egypt and Libya, leaving Iran's leadership unchanged. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 was a defining moment of the modern era. Its success unleashed a wave of Islamist fervor across the Middle East and signaled a sharp decline in the appeal of Western ideologies in the Islamic world. Axworthy takes readers through the major periods in Iranian history over the last thirty years: the overthrow of the old regime and the creation of the new one; the Iran-Iraq war; the reconstruction era following the war; the reformist wave led by Mohammed Khatami; and the present day, in which reactionaries have re-established control. Throughout, he emphasizes that the Iranian revolution was centrally important in modern history because it provided the world with a clear model of development that was not rooted in Western ideologies. Whereas the world's major revolutions of the previous two centuries had been fuelled by Western, secular ideologies, the Iranian Revolution drew its inspiration from Islam. Revolutionary Iran is both richly textured and from one of the leading authorities on the region; combining an expansive scope with the most accessible and definitive account of this epoch in all its humanity""--  ""In Revolutionary Iran, Michael Axworthy guides us through recent Iranian history from shortly before the 1979 Islamic revolution through the summer of 2009, when Iranians poured into the streets of Tehran by the hundreds of thousands, demanding free, democratic government.

It has been an important by-product of colonialism and the enslavement of African peoples by Europeans. Though it has taken a variety of forms over the two centuries of its fight for equality and against economic exploitation, commonality has been a unifying theme for many black people. It has, for example, resulted in the Back-to-Africa movement in the United States but also in Nationalist beliefs such as an African 'supra-nation'.Pan-African History brings together Pan-Africanist thinkers and activists from the Anglophone and Francophone worlds of the past two-hundred years. Included are well-known figures such as Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, and Martin Delany, and the authors' original research on lesser-known figures such as Constance Cummings-John and Duse Mohammed Ali reveals exciting new aspects of Pan-African activism.

Nuclear Disarmament and Non-Proliferation,Sverre Lodgaard,political_science,First published in 2010,/works/OL20933723W,/authors/OL676891A/Sverre_Lodgaard,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28360819M-M.jpg,"Publish Date Oct 01, 2010|Publisher  Taylor & Francis,              Routledge|Language English|Pages 288","This book examines the current debate on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, notably the international non-proliferation regime and how to implement its disarmament provisions. Discussing the requirements of a new international consensus on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, this book builds on the three pillars of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT): non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It reviews the impact of Cold War and post-Cold War policies on current disarmament initiatives and analyses contemporary proliferation problems: how to deal with the states that never joined the NPT (India, Pakistan and Israel); how states that have been moving toward nuclear weapons have been brought back to non-nuclear-weapon status; and, in particular, how to deal with Iran and North Korea. The analysis centres on the relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation in an increasingly multi-centric world involving China and India as well as the US, the European powers and Russia. It concludes with a description and discussion of three different worlds without nuclear weapons and their implications for nuclear disarmament policies. This book will be of great interest to all students of arms control, strategic studies, war and conflict studies, and IR/security studies in general Sverre Lodgaard is a Senior Research Fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, Oslo.

The full bibliography of pamphlets relating to the Anglo-American struggle published in the colonies through the year 1776 contains not a dozen or so items but over four hundred. In the end I concluded that no fewer than seventy-two of them ought to be re-published. But sheer numbers were not the most important measure of the magnitude of the project. The pamphlets include all sorts of writings -- treatises on political theory, essays on history, political arguments, sermons, correspondence, poems -- and they display all sorts of literary devices. But for all their variety they have in common one distinctive characteristic: they are, to an unusual degree, explanatory. They reveal not merely positions taken but the reasons why positions were taken; they review motive and understanding: the assumptions, beliefs, and ideas -- the articulated worldview -- that lay behind the manifest events of the time. As a result I found myself, as I read through these many documents, studying not simply a particular medium of publication but, through these documents, nothing less than the ideological origins of the American Revolution. - Foreword.

Drawing on the fear of external threats, this book develops a theory of 'negative association' that examines the dynamics captured by the maxim 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend'. It then traces its role from Greek and Roman political thought, through Machiavelli and the reason of state thinkers, and Hobbes and his emulators and critics, to the realists of the twentieth century. By focusing on the role of fear and enmity in the formation of individual and group identity, this book reveals an important tradition in the history of political thought and offers new insights into texts that are considered familiar. This book demonstrates that the fear of external threats is an essential element of the formation and preservation of political groups and that its absence renders political association unsustainable.

Does such ahistoricism render political philosophy too abstract? Is political philosophy thus incapable of dealing with the realities of political life? This volume brings together some of the world's leading political philosophers to address these crucial questions. The contributors focus especially on political philosophy's pretensions to universality and on its strained relationship with the world of real politics. Some chapters argue that political philosophers should not be cowed by the accusations levied against them from outside of their own field. Others insist that these accusations require a dramatic reshaping of normative political thought. The volume will spark controversy across political philosophy and beyond""--  ""In this volume we carve out a new approach to the identity of political philosophy by exploring a problem that is central to such disciplinary soul-searching: the problem of political philosophy's relationship with history. We do this in part because, according to whether they describe their approach to political philosophy as analytic, continental, Rawlsian, post-Rawlsian, pluralist, realist, post-structural, or indeed, outright historical, political philosophers of different stripes tend, amongst other things, to hold very different positions on this relationship, and that is a very curious pattern. We also do it because, as evinced by the following chapters, reflecting upon the significance of history for political philosophy soon leads to a host of new insights about the nature of our subject""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hubo cambios radicales que dieron por resultado tendencias opuestas a las que imperaban en los tranquilos años de los señores feudales. En El liberalismo europeo, Harold J. Laski estudia esos cambios, las nuevas relaciones sociales que surgieron a partir de ellos y el ascenso de la burguesía al poder; todos factores decisivos que impulsaron el surgimiento del liberalismo como doctrina por excelencia de la civilización occidental. Sin embargo, al momento de publicar el libro (1936), el autor se dio cuenta de que el liberalismo, cuyo triunfo había llegado en el siglo XIX, se encontraba en crisis. Por ello, destaca la necesidad de efectuar reajustes en el pensamiento y de crear normas de mayor justicia. A pesar de los años transcurridos desde su publicación, la obra permanece vigente, ya que la humanidad continúa en espera de ese «nuevo orden social basado en una relación nueva de hombre a hombre», pensado por el autor.

Examining Mexico's Zapatista rebels and Nigeria's Ogoni ethnic group, the book draws critical conclusions about social movements, NGOs, and 'global civil society'.

Far from it, democratization has been marked by setbacks and victories, a process often referred to as ""contested democracy"". In view of recent mobilizations such as the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement, in which new technologies have played a key role, there is a need for a renewed analysis of the long-term evolution of US and UK political systems. Using new areas of research, this book argues that the ideals and the practices of Anglo-American democracy can be best understood by studying diverse forms of participation, which go beyond classical expressions of contestation and dissent such as voting. The authors analyze political parties, social movements, communications and social media, governance, cultural diversity, identity politics, public-private actors and social cohesion to illustrate how the structure and context of popular participation play a significant role in whether, and when, citizens' efforts have any meaningful impact on those who exercise political power. In doing so, the authors take crucial steps towards understanding how a vigorous public sphere and popular sovereignty can be made to work in today's global environment. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of political science, British and US history, democracy, political participation, governance, social movements and politics""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The picture he paints of a family willing to do ANYTHING to hold power and a country so craven as to vote for it is both very funny and completely dismaying in equal measure.

The war of words between Right and Left collapsed into a shooting war, and raged between the high-technology weapons on each side, devastating cities, and over-running the countryside.  When the American dream shatters into violence, who could hold the people and the government together?  At the close of Empire, political scientist and government advisor Averell Torrent has maneuvered himself into the Presidency of the United States in the aftermath of the devastating insurrection and civil war. But the truth is, he engineered that war, and becoming President is just the next step in his plan. Now that he has complete power, he has two goals: To expand the American imperial power around the world, and to control or silence the very few people who know that he was behind the assassination of the last elected President.  But Captain Bartholomew Coleman, known as Cole to his friends and enemies alike, sees the danger Torrent poses to American democracy. Cole quickly runs afoul of Torrent; on the run, he'll need to find hard evidence to prove what he knows to be true.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

El libro está basado en una investigación inmensa sobre fuentes de derecha y de izquierda, y es fruto de más de cinco años de trabajo en archivos de varios países.

Who is actually running U.S. foreign policy? The story begins on September 12, 2001, as America began to gather itself for a response to the unimaginable. Journalist Suskind tells us what actually occurred over the next three years, from the inside out, by tracing the steps of the key actors who oversee the ""war on terror"" and report progress to an anxious nation; and the invisibles, the men and women just below the line of sight, left to improvise plans to defeat a new kind of enemy in an hour-by-hour race against disaster. The internal battles between these two teams--one, the Bush administration, under the hot lights; the other, actually fighting the fight--reveal everything about what America faces, and what it has done, in this age of terror.--From publisher description.

The sense of belonging to a nation has never been more in flux. Simultaneously, nationalistic and racist movements are gaining ground and barriers are being erected against immigration. Citizenship, Nationality and Migration in Europe examines how concepts of citizenship have evolved in different countries and varying contexts. It explores the interconnection between ideas of the nation, modes of citizenship and the treatment of migrants. Adopting a distinctive multi-disciplinary and international approach, this collection brings together leading experts from several fields including political studies, history, law and sociology. By juxtaposing four European countries - Britain, France, Germany and Italy - and setting current trends against a historical background it highlights important differences and exposes similarities in the urgent questions surrounding citizenship and the treatment of minorities in Europe today.

When he hit the airwaves thirty years ago, Stossel helped create a whole new category of news, dedicated to protecting and informing consumers. As a crusading reporter, he chased snake-oil peddlers, rip-off artists, and corporate thieves, winning the applause of his peers.But along the way, he noticed that there was something far more troublesome going on: While the networks screamed about the dangers of exploding BIC lighters and coffeepots, worse risks were ignored. And while reporters were teaming up with lawyers and legislators to stick it to big business, they seldom reported the ways the free market made life better.In Give Me a Break, Stossel explains how ambitious bureaucrats, intellectually lazy reporters, and greedy lawyers make your life worse even as they claim to protect your interests. Taking on such sacred cows as the FDA, the War on Drugs, and scaremongering environmental activists -- and backing up his trademark irreverence with careful reasoning and research -- he shows how the problems that government tries and fails to fix can be solved better by the extraordinary power of the free market.He traces his journey from cub reporter to 20/20 co-anchor, revealing his battles to get his ideas to the public, his struggle to overcome stuttering, and his eventual realization that, for years, much of his reporting missed the point.Stossel concludes the book with a provocative blueprint for change: a simple plan in the spirit of the Founding Fathers to ensure that America remains a place ""where free minds -- and free markets -- make good things happen.""

Divided into five sections, these essays explore the social, political, and cultural role of imagination and civic engagement, offering cogent, ingenious reflections that stand in stark contrast to the often grim rhetoric of our era. Short and succinct, the essays engage with an interconnected ensemble of themes and issues while also providing insights into the specific geographical and social dynamics of each author’s national or regional context.  Part 1 introduces the reader to theoretical reflections on imagination and the public sphere;    Part 2 illustrates dynamics of public imagination in a diverse set of cultural contexts;    Part 3 reflects in various ways on the urgent need for a radically transformed public and civic imagination in the face of worldwide ecological crisis;    Part 4 suggests new societal possibilities that are related to spiritual as well as politically revolutionary sources of inspiration;    Part 5 explores characteristics of present and potentially emerging global society and the existing transnational framework that could provide resources for a more humane global order.    Erudite and thought-provoking, On Public Imagination makes a vital contribution to political thought, and is accessible to activists, students, and scholars alike.

Jean Hampton was one of the most gifted philosophers involved in these debates and provided both important criticisms of prominent contractarian theories plus powerful defenses and applications of the core ideas of contractarianism. In these essays, she brought her distinctive approach, animated by concern for the intrinsic worth of persons, to bear on topics such as guilt, punishment, self-respect, family relations, and the maintenance and justification of the state.  Edited by Daniel Farnham, this collection is an essential contribution to understanding the problems and prospectus of contractarianism in moral, legal and political philosophy.

This book presents an evaluation of the present EU Treaty of Lisbon in comparison with the original EU Constitutional Treaty, and analyses the importance of consent of the people, asking if saving the treaty came at the cost of democracy. Drawing first-hand on the referendum in the Netherlands, this book outlines an original political theory of democratic constitutionalisation beyond the nation-state, and argues that international organizations can be put on democratic foundations, but only by properly engaging national political structures.Assessing the EU Constitutional Treaty will be of interest to students and scholars of European Union politics, history and policy""--  ""The negative results of referenda on the European Union (EU) Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, and subsequent forced compliance via the Treaty of Lisbon raise complex questions about democratic constitutionalism.

"The trouble with terror: liberty, security and the response to terrorism",Tamar Meisels,political_science,First published in 2008,/works/OL8701064W?edition=ia%3Atroublewithterro00meis_656,/authors/OL2945315A/Tamar_Meisels,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16910774M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 239,"What is terrorism and can it ever be defended? Beginning with its definition, proceeding to its possible justifications, and culminating in proposals for contending with and combating it, this book offers a full theoretical analysis of the issue of terrorism. Tamar Meisels argues that, regardless of its professed cause, terrorism is diametrically opposed to the requirements of liberal morality and can only be defended at the expense of relinquishing the most basic of liberal commitments. Meisels opposes those who express sympathy and justification for Islamist (particularly Palestinian) terrorism and terrorism allegedly carried out on behalf of developing nations, but, at the same time, also opposes those who would tolerate any reduction in civil liberties in exchange for greater security. Calling wholeheartedly for a unanimous liberal front against terrorism, this is a strong and provocative attempt to address the tension between liberty and security in a time of terror.

Based on in-depth original research, the case study of the ""Environmental Movement"" is integrated into a historical and comparative analysis which contributes to a better understanding of social movements of Iran. Implementing the new social movement theory of Touraine and Melucci in the Iranian context, the study offers a critical framework for studying social change and transformation of non-European countries""--  ""Despite the growing significance of social movements worldwide, scholarship in on the subject remains largely Western in nature, with studies written primarily by Western scholars and based on the experiences of Western cultures and societies. This book makes an important contribution to the study of social movements in non-Western societies by examining their development in Iran. With a particular focus on the recent environmental movement, the author sheds light on the implications and significance of these movements. Drawing on in-depth original research, the case study of the environmental movement is integrated into a historical and comparative analysis. Implementing the new social movement theory of Touraine and Melucci in the Iranian context, the author shows that although the reform movement is unique, in some aspects it is a continuation of the past movements. She places emphasis on the role of women in recent Iranian social movements, exploring the significance of social movements in civil society and in instigating social change. Using the case of Iran to offer a critical framework for studying social change and transformation of non-European countries, this book fills an important gap in the existing literature on the topic. As such, it will be of great interest to scholars and students of sociology, political science and Middle Eastern studies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Corruption and law in Indonesia,Simon Butt,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL15934064W,/authors/OL6941022A/Simon_Butt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Routledge|Language English,"""Post-Soeharto Indonesia is now at a critical juncture. Many defining characteristics of the 33 years of Soeharto's authoritarian rule have been discarded. Indonesia has transformed from one of Southeast Asia's most repressive and centralised political systems to its most decentralised and democratic. Its judiciary is has been made largely independent of government; economic development is solid; and its Constitution now boasts a world-standard Bill of Rights. Yet obstacles remain to Indonesia achieving the ""rule of law"". In particular, Indonesia is consistently rated as having some of the highest levels of corruption in the world, often attributed to the continuing influence of Soeharto-era powerbrokers and their prot©♭g©♭s. Pervasive corruption is said to hamper economic growth and prevent governance reforms aimed at improving transparency and accountability, leading some commentators to question the ""quality"" of Indonesian democracy and, ultimately, the longevity of post-Soeharto reform. The focus of this book is to highlight the ""pushback"", led by powerful entrenched political interests, against the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court, through legal process. The book shows that the KPK has been the target of systematic efforts aimed at undermining its success in corruption cases and, ultimately, bringing it down""--  ""Indonesia has transformed from one of South East Asia's most repressive and centralised political systems to its most decentralised and democratic. Despite this, obstacles still remain that hinder Indonesia achieving the 'rule of law', and in particular, the country is consistently ranked as having one of the highest levels of corruption in the world. This book assesses Indonesia's anti-corruption reforms over the past decade, focusing on the Anti-corruption Commission (KPK) and the Anti-corruption Court (ACC). The book discusses how both institutions have been largely successful since they began operating on 2004. Before 2008, the KPK and ACC largely focused on mid-senior level targets and faced resistance primarily in the form of constitutional challenges to their jurisdictions and powers. From 2008, however, the KPK began targeting politically-powerful figures, drawing resistance that now threatens the future efficacy of both institutions. It is largely in Indonesia's courtrooms and lawmaking institutions that key battles between reformists and those preferring the status quo have played out. This book describes and analyses these judicial processes and legal changes. It shows that despite persistent claims that Indonesia's legal system is dysfunctional, law is far from irrelevant in modern day Indonesia. The book is a useful contribution to South East Asian politics and Asian law""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Globalization and National Security top scholars of international relations assess the consequences of globalization for national security? The volume identifies three distinct ""processes"" of globalization - the intensification of economic exchange, the flow of information, and marketization (the expansion of the set of social relations governed by market forces)-and explores how they can affect the capacity and power of states as well as conflict within and among them. Most importantly, the essays deal with how state-less actors, such as terrorists, utilize the benefits of globalization changes the nature of the security game. Failure to account for the influence of globalization will make it increasingly difficult to understand changes in the balance of power, prospects for war, and strategic choices embraced by states.

The emergence of technologies such as drones, autonomous robotics, artificial intelligence, cyber and biotechnologies has stimulated worldwide debates on their use, risks, and benefits in both the civilian and the security-related fields. This volume examines the concept of ‘governance’ as an analytical framework and tool to investigate how new and emerging security technologies are governed in practice within the European Union (EU), emphasizing the relational configurations among different state and non-state actors. With reference to European governance, it addresses the complex interplay of power relations, interests, and framings surrounding the development of policies and strategies for the use of new security technologies. The work examines varied conceptual tools to shed light on the way diverse technologies are embedded in EU policy frameworks. Each contribution identifies actors involved in the governance of a specific technology sector, their multi-level institutional and corporate configurations, and the conflicting forces, values, ethical, and legal concerns, as well as security imperatives and economic interests.  This book will be of much interest to students of science and technology studies, security studies and EU policy.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Contested Ground tells a story of dispossession and denial but it is also a positive account, revealing the persistent struggles of Aboriginal communities for a better future.Clearly written and generously illustrated, this book demonstrates why Australian Aboriginal history, like the very land itself, remains contested ground.'Both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians have a lot to learn about each other before reconciliation between the two peoples can be realised. This book will go a long way towards achieving that end.' - Paul Behrendt.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By the time he was thirty he was at the heart of British intellectual life. He has remained its commanding presence ever since, and few would dispute that he was one of Britain's greatest thinkers. His reputation extends worldwide--as a great conversationalist, intellectual historian, and man of letters. He has been called the century's most inspired reader.  Yet Berlin's contributions to thought--in particular to moral and political philosophy, and to liberal theory--are little understood, and surprisingly neglected by the academic world. In this book, they are shown to be animated by a single, powerful, subversive idea: value-pluralism which affirms the reality of a deep conflict between ultimate human values that reason cannot resolve. Though bracingly clear-headed, humane and realist, Berlin's value-pluralism runs against the dominant Western traditions, secular and religious, which avow an ultimate harmony of values. It supports a highly distinctive restatement of liberalism in Berlin's work--an agnostic liberalism, which is founded not on rational choice but on the radical choices we make when faced with intractable dilemmas. It is this new statement of liberalism, the central subject of John Gray's lively and lucid book, which gives the liberal intellectual tradition a new lease on life, a new source of life, and which comprises Berlin's central and enduring legacy.

Crnobrnja describes the patchwork of nationalities held together by the sheer force of Tito's will, and shows how the erosion of Soviet power in Eastern Europe led inexorably to chaos and violence. At Tito's death, his stifling of domestic politics left no stable legacy - the only political memories that Yugoslavs were able to draw on were the memories of their various nationalisms.

The Politics of Evidence,Justin Parkhurst,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20931077W,/authors/OL7946068A/Justin_Parkhurst,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2016-12-05|Publisher  Taylor & Francis,              Routledge|Language English|Pages 182","There has been an enormous increase in interest in the use of evidence for public policymaking, but the vast majority of work on the subject has failed to engage with the political nature of decision making and how this influences the ways in which evidence will be used (or misused) within political areas. This book provides new insights into the nature of political bias with regards to evidence and critically considers what an ?improved? use of evidence would look like from a policymaking perspective. Part I describes the great potential for evidence to help achieve social goals, as well as the challenges raised by the political nature of policymaking. It explores the concern of evidence advocates that political interests drive the misuse or manipulation of evidence, as well as counter-concerns of critical policy scholars about how appeals to ?evidence-based policy? can depoliticise political debates. Both concerns reflect forms of bias ? the first representing technical bias, whereby evidence use violates principles of scientific best practice, and the second representing issue bias in how appeals to evidence can shift political debates to particular questions or marginalise policy-relevant social concerns.  Part II then draws on the fields of policy studies and cognitive psychology to understand the origins and mechanisms of both forms of bias in relation to political interests and values. It illustrates how such biases are not only common, but can be much more predictable once we recognise their origins and manifestations in policy arenas.  Finally, Part III discusses ways to move forward for those seeking to improve the use of evidence in public policymaking. It explores what constitutes ?good evidence for policy?, as well as the ?good use of evidence? within policy processes, and considers how to build evidence-advisory institutions that embed key principles of both scientific good practice and democratic representation. Taken as a whole, the approach promoted is termed the ?good governance of evidence? ? a concept that represents the use of rigorous, systematic and technically valid pieces of evidence within decision-making processes that are representative of, and accountable to, populations served.

Sian Reynolds shows how women in fact had both autonomy and authority within the political arena through their activities in social work, peace movements and strikes, and in other areas less directly linked with conventional politics. Sian Reynolds brings together two kinds of history: the political history of France between the wars as it appears in general textbooks, and the work carried out in women's history covering the same period.  In doing so she creates a history in which gender contributes in new ways to historical analysis.The book is not, however, concerned exclusively with critical hariography. It is also the result of the author's and others' recent empirical and archival research. As such, it is a book which will appeal to both those studying French history and women's history.

Noise mapping is the first tool for assessing noise exposure, communicating information to citizens, and defining effective action plans. Indeed, strategic noise maps are now required for all population centres of more than 250,000 inhabitants and for major roads, railways and airports, and strategic noise maps are now becoming required for urban areas with over 100,000 people.This comprehensive reference guide for technicians and acoustics consultants shows how to integrate data with geographical information systems, improve accuracy in model and prediction software, and assess different methods and descriptors for evaluating annoyance and noise exposure. It provides guidance on regulations, communication processes for citizens involved in decision making, physical aspects, and application.

You might think I'm off base, but every day around half the people in this country go out of their way to prove me right.—from Somebody's Gotta Say ItThink you've got it all figured out? Think again.Neal Boortz—the Talkmaster, the High Priest of the Church of the Painful Truth—has been edifying, infuriating, and entertaining talk radio audiences for more than three decades with his blend of straight talk and twisted humor. Now, the author of the smash number one bestseller The FairTax Book returns to gore every sacred cow in the pasture, from the subversive agendas behind children's books to the scam artists behind ""High Art."" In Somebody's Gotta Say It, Boortz warms up for the coming political season with a preemptive strike in ""the War on the Individual"": ""The Democrats' theme for 2008 will be 'The Common Good.' I can't speak for you, but I am an individual. Government exists to protect my rights, not to order my life. And I damn sure don't exist to serve government."" He takes on liberal catchphrases like giving back (""Nobody—especially not the evil, wretched rich—actually earns anything anymore. Why do liberals think this way? Because they find it impossible to acknowledge that people work for money""), our rampant civic idiocy (""We are not a democracy. Never were. Weren't supposed to be. And we shouldn't be""), and Big Brother (""We have smoke-free workplaces. We have drug-free school zones. I say let's start establishing government-free oases, where we can be free to leave our seat belts unbuckled, and peel the labels off anything we choose""). And somehow, along the way, he finds room for pop quizzes, cat-chasing contests, and an answer, once and for all, to the eternal question, ""Neal, why don't you run for president?""—in a chapter called ""No Way in Hell.""  Full of irresistible wisecracks and irrefutable libertarian wisdom, Somebody's Gotta Say It is one man's response to America at a time when the government overreaches, the people underperform—and the truth hurts.

During the 20th century, in excess of 100 million people had their lives taken from them as the result of extremist violence. In this wide-ranging book Manus I. Midlarsky suggests that ephemeral gains, together with mortality salience, form basic explanations for the origins of political extremism and constitute a theoretical framework that also explains later mass violence. Midlarsky applies his framework to multiple forms of political extremism including the rise of Italian, Hungarian and Romanian fascism, Nazism, radical Islamism, and Soviet, Chinese and Cambodian communism. Other applications include a rampaging military (Japan, Pakistan, Indonesia) and extreme nationalism in Serbia, Croatia, the Ottoman Empire and Rwanda. Polish anti-Semitism after World War II and the rise of separatist violence in Sri Lanka are also examined""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Much effort and energy have been expended ever since in endeavouring to show that Spain has not been different, but normal. Still, many of the defining features of the country's past--the civil wars, the weak liberalism, the Franco dictatorship--are taken as evidence of its distinctiveness. A related problem is that few historians have actually placed Spain's trajectory over the last two centuries within a truly comparative context. This book does so by tackling a number of key themes in modern Spanish history: liberalism, nationalism, anticlericalism, the Second Republic, the Franco dictatorship and the transition to democracy. Is Spain Different? thereby offers a fresh and stimulating perspective on Spain's recent past that is not only of interest to students of Spanish and European history alike, but also sheds new light on the current political debates regarding Spain's place in the world""--From publihser's website.

Ethnic protest allowed groups to learn about the nature and limits of each other's claims, facilitating new democratic institutions""--  ""In societies divided on ethnic and religious lines, problems of democracy are magnified ,Ŭ particularly where groups are mobilized into parties. With the principle of majority rule, minorities should be less willing to endorse democratic institutions where their parties persistently lose elections. While such problems should also hamper transitions to democracy, several diverse Eastern European states have formed democracies even under these conditions. In this book, Sherrill Stroschein argues that sustained protest and contention by ethnic Hungarians in Romania and Slovakia brought concessions on policies that they could not achieve through the ballot box, in contrast to Transcarpathia, Ukraine. In Romania and Slovakia, contention during the 1990s made each group accustomed to each other,Ŵs claims, and aware of the degree to which each could push its own. Ethnic contention became a de facto deliberative process that fostered a moderation of group stances, allowing democratic consolidation to slowly and organically take root""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The European Dream: How Europe's Vision of the Future Is Quietly Eclipsing the American Dream,Jeremy Rifkin,political_science,First published in 2004,/works/OL2737731W?edition=ia%3Aeuropeandreamhow00rifk,/authors/OL401299A/Jeremy_Rifkin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24752188M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Jeremy P. Tarcher/Penguin|Language English|Pages 434,"""The American Dream is in decline. Americans are increasingly overworked, underpaid, and squeezed for time. But there is an alternative: the European Dream-a more leisurely, healthy, prosperous, and sustainable way of life. Europe's lifestyle is not only desirable, argues Jeremy Rifkin, but may be crucial to sustaining prosperity in the new era. With the dawn of the European Union, Europe has become an economic superpower in its own right-its GDP now surpasses that of the United States. Europe has achieved newfound dominance not by single-mindedly driving up stock prices, expanding working hours, and pressing every household into a double- wage-earner conundrum. Instead, the New Europe relies on market networks that place cooperation above competition; promotes a new sense of citizenship that extols the well-being of the whole person and the community rather than the dominant individual; and recognizes the necessity of deep play and leisure to create a better, more productive, and healthier workforce. From the medieval era to modernity, Rifkin delves deeply into the history of Europe, and eventually America, to show how the continent has succeeded in slowly and steadily developing a more adaptive, sensible way of working and living. In The European Dream, Rifkin posits a dawning truth that only the most jingoistic can ignore: Europe's flexible, communitarian model of society, business, and citizenship is better suited to the challenges of the twenty-first century. Indeed, the European Dream may come to define the new century as the American Dream defined the century now past."" http://www.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0720/2004047935-d.html.

Establishing the WEU as a support organization, designed to promote the two security 'ideas' of collective defence and integration through the primary organizations of Alliance and Community, this book offers a window onto the challenges faced in the development and management of NATO and the evolving EC/EU over time. As the WEU's historical journey unfolds, the frequently competing visions of the future organization of the European security space are exposed in the fluctuating nature of its own functional evolution and devolution. A hybrid organization driven by its dual support role, the constructively ambiguous and conveniently autonomous WEU was to provide a mechanism through which divergent interests could converge and inherent tensions be relieved, preventing NATO and EC/EU stagnation. This book offers fresh insight into the means by which the gradual transformation of the institutional framework of European security was enabled, and stakes the WEU's claim as a fundamental and life-long contributor to the stability of the European security system.""

Like the Democratic Republic of Georgia in 1918, its successors emerged after 1991 from a bankrupt empire, and faced, yet again, the task of establishing a new economic, political and social system from scratch. In both 1918 and 1991, Georgia was confronted with a hostile Russia and followed a pro-Western and pro-democratic course. The top regional experts in this book explore the domestic and external parallels between the Georgian post-colonial governments of the early twentieth and twenty-first centuries. How did the inexperienced Georgian leaders in both eras deal with the challenge of secessionism, what were their state building strategies, and what did democracy mean to them? What did their electoral systems look like, why were their economic strategies so different, and how did they negotiate with the international community neighbouring threats. These are the central challenges of transitional governments around the world today. Georgia's experience over one hundred years suggests that both history and contemporary political analysis offer the best (and most interesting) explanation of the often ambivalent outcomes""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In So You Want to Talk About Race, Editor at Large of The Establishment, Ijeoma Oluo offers a contemporary, accessible take on the racial landscape in America, addressing head-on such issues as privilege, police brutality, intersectionality, micro-aggressions, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the ""N"" word. Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don't dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans.  Oluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned, and crystalize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and Jessica Valenti in Full Frontal Feminism, and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor's seminal essay ""The Meaning of a Word.""""--   Read more Read less",137 Want to read|3 Currently reading|20 Have read
