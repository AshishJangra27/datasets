There are, however, obstacles in Sonchai's path to nirvana. Police Colonel Vikorn has just named Sonchai his consigliere (he's been studying The Godfather on DVD): to troubleshoot, babysit, defuse, procure, reconnoiter--do whatever needs to be done in Vikorn's ongoing battle with Army General Zinna for control of Bangkok's network of illegal enterprises. And though Tietsin is enlightened and (eerily) charismatic, he also has forty million dollars' worth of heroin for sale. If Sonchai truly wants to be an initiate into Tietsin's ""apocalyptic Buddhism,"" he has to pull off a deal that will bring Vikorn and Zinna to the same side of the table. Further complicating the challenge is Tara: a Tantric practitioner who captivates Sonchai with her remarkable otherworldly techniques.Here is Sonchai put to the extreme test--as a cop, as a Buddhist, as an impossibly earthbound man--in John Burdett's most wildly inventive, darkly comic, and wickedly entertaining novel yet.From the Hardcover edition.

Unwilling to deal with her overwhelming emotions, Karen packs the notebook away, putting it - and her father - out of her mind, until she receives a shocking phone call. Her father has been murdered on the gritty streets of New Orleans.

But she changes her mind when her home is burglarized and ""accidents"" begin to happen. All at once, she faces a chilling realization: whoever killed her father is now after her. Desperate for answers, Karen retrieves the only thing that links her to her father - the notebook he had sent months before. Inside its worn pages, she makes an unsettling discovery: her father had been a sniper in Vietnam and the notebook contains a detailed account of each one of his kills.   Now running for her life, Karen entrusts the book and its secrets to Marc Chastain.

When a skier goes missing at Sun Valley’s Galena Summit, Sheriff Walt Fleming quickly assembles his crack search-and-rescue team and heads out into the snowy night. Despite the treacherous conditions, Walt and his group, including deputy Tommy Brandon and Walt’s best friend, Mark Aker, set off on skis, accompanied by highly trained search dogs. Within minutes, something goes horribly wrong: a shot rings out, and one of their team is dead. By morning, Mark Aker has disappeared. Torn between professional responsibility and the desperate urge to find his friend, Walt is further challenged by an unexplained illness at a local water-bottling plant that sends workers to the hospital and sets off biohazard warnings. Following threads of questionable evidence through the glitter of Sun Valley leads Walt to an unlikely—and darker—source, and reveals a crime played out on a much larger scale than he originally envisioned. Waist-deep in snow and knee-deep in lies, the life of his friend in the balance, Walt begins to suspect that the whole operation is controlled by people of great wealth and power, which leaves him where he started: out in the cold. From adrenaline-charged start to explosive finish, Killer View is heart-stopping suspense at its very best.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The third secret is sealed away in the Vatican, read only by popes, and not disclosed until the year 2000. When revealed, its quizzical tone and anticlimactic nature leave many faithful wondering if the Church has truly unveiled all of the Virgin Mary's words--or if a message far more important has been left in the shadows. Vatican City, present day: Papal secretary Father Colin Michener is concerned for the Pope. Michener knows that the Pope's distress stems from the revelations of Fatima. Equally concerned, but not out of any sense of compassion, is Alberto Cardinal Valendrea, the Vatican's Secretary of State. Valendrea desperately covets the papacy, having narrowly lost out to Clement at the last conclave. Now the Pope's interest in Fatima threatens to uncover a shocking ancient truth that Valendrea has kept to himself for many years. When Pope Clement sends Michener to the Romanian highlands, then to a Bosnian holy site, in search of a priest-possibly one of the last people on Earth who knows Mary's true message--a perilous set of events unfolds. Michener finds himself embroiled in murder, suspicion, suicide, deceit, and his forbidden passion for a beloved woman. In a desperate search for answers, he travels to Pope Clement's birthplace in Germany, where he learns that the third secret of Fatima may dictate the very fate of the Church.

The President of the United States is wounded; his best friend and a Secret Service agent are killed. Two days later, a man in Landover, Maryland, commits suicide and in the man's home is overwhelming evidence that he was responsible for the assassination attempt.General Andy Banks, the Secretary of Homeland Security, is nursing a guilty conscience. Only days before the assassination attempt on the President, Banks had received a note with a dire warning: ""Eagle One is in danger. Cancel Chattooga River. The inside ring has been compromised. This is not a joke."" The message--on Secret Service stationery--was signed ""An agent in the wrong place."" Banks immediately passed the note on to Secret Service Director Patrick Donnelly, who proceeded to ignore it.Even after the assassin is found dead, Banks is determined to dig a little deeper. He turns to Speaker of the House John Fitzgerald Mahoney. The Speaker has a guy--an under-the-radar, go-to guy he uses for things like this--things he can't afford to have connected to his office. The guy is Joe DeMarco, an honest lawyer with a sordid family history.  After one meeting with Banks, DeMarco realizes he's in way over his head. But Mahoney finds the prospect of taking down Donnelly irresistible and sets DeMarco on a trail that twists through the Secret Service, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security and snakes all the way back to one of the more enduring mysteries of the twentieth century.Brimming with suspense, authenticity, and wit, The Inside Ring marks the debut of a major new talent and introduces a cast of intriguing characters with many more cases ahead.

Traditional Chinese medicine prizes those parts for home remedies, and people will do extreme things to get what they need.

Three children, running in the woods behind their school, stumble upon a partially buried female body, eyes and mouth glued shut. Close behind the children is their teacher, Anne Navarre, shocked by this discovery and heartbroken as she witnesses the end of their innocence. What she doesn't yet realize is that this will mark the end of innocence for an entire community, as the ties that bind families and friends are tested by secrets uncovered in the wake of a serial killer's escalating activity.  Detective Tony Mendez, fresh from a law enforcement course at FBI headquarters, is charged with interpreting those now revealed secrets. He's using a new technique-profiling-to develop a theory of the case, a strategy that pushes him ever deeper into the lives of the three children, and closer to the young teacher whose interest in recent events becomes as intense as his own.  As new victims are found and the media scrutiny of the investigation bears down on them, both Mendez and Navarre are unsure if those who suffer most are the victims themselves-or the family and friends of the killer, blissfully unaware that someone very close to them is a brutal, calculating psychopath.

It is Thomas's debut novel, expanded from a short story she wrote in college in reaction to the police shooting of Oscar Grant. The book is narrated by Starr Carter, a 16-year-old black girl from a poor neighborhood who attends an elite private school in a predominantly white, affluent part of the city. Starr becomes entangled in a national news story after she witnesses a white police officer shoot and kill her childhood friend, Khalil. She speaks up about the shooting in increasingly public ways, and social tensions culminate in a riot after a grand jury decides not to indict the police officer for the shooting.  The Hate U Give was published on February 28, 2017, by HarperCollins imprint Balzer + Bray, which had won a bidding war for the rights to the novel. The book was a commercial success, debuting at number one on The New York Times young adult best-seller list, where it remained for 50 weeks. It won several awards and received critical praise for Thomas's writing and timely subject matter. In writing the novel, Thomas attempted to expand readers' understanding of the Black Lives Matter movement as well as difficulties faced by black Americans who employ code switching. These themes, as well as the vulgar language, attracted some controversy and caused the book to be one of the most challenged books of 2017 and 2018 according to the American Library Association.

Her body has barely begun to heal; her mind feels broken. And her life is completely shattered: Three years ago, she and her younger brother, Abek, were the only members of their family to be sent to the right, away from the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau. Everyone else--her parents, her grandmother, radiant Aunt Maja--they went left.  Zofia's last words to her brother were a promise: Abek to Zofia, A to Z. When I find you again, we will fill our alphabet. Now her journey to fulfill that vow takes her through Poland and Germany, and into a displaced persons camp where everyone she meets is trying to piece together a future from a painful past: Miriam, desperately searching for the twin she was separated from after they survived medical experimentation. Breine, a former heiress, who now longs only for a simple wedding with her new fiancé. And Josef, who guards his past behind a wall of secrets, and is beautiful and strange and magnetic all at once.  But the deeper Zofia digs, the more impossible her search seems. How can she find one boy in a sea of the missing? In the rubble of a broken continent, Zofia must delve into a mystery whose answers could break her--or help her rebuild her world.

Now Salama volunteers at a hospital in Homs, helping the wounded who flood through the doors daily. Secretly, though, she is desperate to find a way out of her beloved country before her sister-in-law, Layla, gives birth.

A fish out of water at school and a stranger at home, Jessica feels more lost than ever now that the only person with whom she could really communicate has gone. How is she supposed to deal with the boy- and shopping-crazy girls at school, her dad's obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over big sister Bethany's lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life?A fresh, funny, utterly compelling fiction debut by first-time novelist Megan McCafferty, Sloppy Firsts is an insightful, true-to-life look at Jessica's predicament as she embarks on another year of teenage torment--from the dark days of Hope's departure through her months as a type-A personality turned insomniac to her completely mixed-up feelings about Marcus Flutie, the intelligent and mysterious ""Dreg"" who works his way into her heart. Like a John Hughes for the twenty-first century, Megan McCafferty taps into the inherent humor and drama of the teen experience. This poignant, hilarious novel is sure to appeal to readers who are still going through it, as well as those who are grateful that they don't have to go back and grow up all over again.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Salahudin and Noor are more than best friends; they are family. Growing up as outcasts in the small desert town of Juniper, California, they understand each other the way no one else does.

A secret society. A gray zone between human and beast.  When 16-year-old Bianca arrives at her new boarding school, she is startled to hear that its history includes rumors of witchcraft and torture. The building itself rests on the foundation of a medieval convent with a troubled past. There is also a secret society, whose members begin to harass her. Then one night she stumbles over the body of a dead woman.  With the help of her friend Nicholas, Bianca begins to piece together the story of the mysterious woman and the convent's disturbing history. But Bianca can't shake the feeling she is being followed. She soon realizes she can't trust anyone -- not even Nicholas.  Using elements of the thriller and gothic novel, as well as hints of fantastic and historical fiction, Nina Blazon brings something new to the crime genre.

His name was John until Grandpa said he looked more like a Bird with the way he kept jumping off things, and the name stuck. Bird's thick, black hair was like the head feathers of the blackbirds, Grandpa said, and he bet that one day Bird would fly like one too. Grandpa kept talking like that, and no one paid him much notice until Bird jumped off a cliff. From that day on, Grandpa never spoke another word. Not one. The day that Bird tried to fly, the grown-ups were out looking for him all of them except Mom and Granny. That's because that very day, I was born. Nothing matters. Only Bird matters. And he flew away. Jewel never knew her brother, Bird; he died on the day she was born. But all her life she has lived in his shadow. Her home is filled with secrets, and her grieving grandfather has not uttered a single word in twelve years. Then one night, on her birthday, she finds a mysterious boy sitting in her oak tree. He has the same name as her brother. And he changes everything.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

When the emotion drives out all common sense, we say they're chucking a big one. The telltale signs are: flaming cheeks, shortness of breath, bulging eyes and a prolonged illogical outburst.Gemma Stone is convinced that it's always unseemly to chuck a Birkett and that it's actually insane to chuck one in front of a complete stranger. But that was before she fell in love with a boy who barely knows she exists, before she auditioned for the school play, before she met the family of freaks her sister Debbie is marrying into, before the unpredictable Raven De Head took an interest in her, and before she realised that at the right time and for the right reason, a Birkett could be a beautiful thing.A sharply-observed, funny and bittersweet novel about testing your wings and finding your feet.

Revell Co.|Language English|Pages 125,"Lucretia Ward, or Aunt Crete to her family, lived with her sister and niece.  As an older unmarried lady, she depended on family for room and board, and her family was more than willing to work her fingers to the bone to ""provide for"" her.  Her sister Carrie had plenty of household work for Crete and niece Luella spent all her energy and a great deal of the family's modest resources to attempt to climb socially and marry well.  News arrived one day of the soon arrival of the only child of the remaining sister, a young man from out west, from whom the family had heard little over recent years.  Assuming that the young man was a backwoods hick and would be an embarrassment to them, Carrie and Luella left a few days early for their trip to the shore in hopes of avoiding him, and left Crete with a long to-do list and orders to have it complete upon their return.  Of course, Aunt Crete was not asked to go to the shore; her dumpy figure would embarrass them!  As it happened, Carrie and Luella passed a very handsome man at the train station as Luella was in a tirade.  The man, the expected nephew Donald, later learned that the harsh voice belonged to his cousin when he answered the phone for Aunt Crete.  Luella called with more orders for her hardworking aunt and Donald saw right away what Luella was like and what his aunt had to live with.  He hatched a plan to take Aunt Crete on a well-deserved vacation to the shore, maybe staying at the same hotel.  This backwoods cousin had struck gold out west and was free to do as he chose, and he chose to emancipate Aunt Crete from her cheerless, unappreciated life of servitude.

Morgan, an elite track athlete, is forced to transfer high schools late in her senior year after it turns out being queer is against her private Catholic school's code of conduct.

But while Morgan--out and proud, and determined to have a fresh start--doesn't want to have to keep their budding relationship a secret, Ruby isn't ready to come out yet.

Although Stella starts 'living sequentially' in both realities, she thrives far more in her ancient life. However, an impending war could also get her people slaughtered unless she takes immediate action to save herself and her tribe. During her dual-life journey, Stella draws the interest of Dr. Vale, an unappreciated, thirty-something professor of paleoanthropology, charismatic Chieftain Hari of the Jarmo tribe, and young Ashur, a prehistoric teenager in need of lessons in love. But when the time comes to make an irrevocable choice between the two, will Stella choose down-to-earth reality or the allure of the unknown?

Since moving away from her hometown nearly a decade ago, she’s had to stay in touch with him solely online, where the pair has grown closer than ever sharing everything from their favorite sci-fi shows to cute photos of baby animals, to crises that have cropped up in each of their personal lives as they’ve grown up. Now Rourke is suddenly back in town, and while she’s thrilled to be reunited with the boy who has become her dearest friend, she realizes it won’t be easy seeing him in person again every day. Because over the years, Rourke has fallen deeply in love with Dallas…but Dallas isn’t the sort of guy who falls in love.  As the high school’s resident drama heartthrob, Dallas is known for his passionate starring performances. Unfortunately his Romeo act isn’t only confined to the boards. Off-stage he’s so popular with the opposite sex that other guys come to him for advice on how to succeed with girls. Although Rourke knows there’s a lot more to him than the charismatic playboy everyone else sees, she still doubts Dallas could ever be satisfied with only one girl, especially not one as bookish and old-fashioned as herself. She knows the smart thing to do would be to get over Dallas and fall for someone more suitable, or else resign herself to only finding happily-ever- after within the pages of her favorite romance novels. But if it was hard enough for Rourke to keep from fixating on her charming pal when he was hundreds of miles away, now that she’s living right down the street from him again it seems downright impossible. Especially with Dallas sending her so many strangely mixed messages concerning his own feelings about her…  More About the Book   -- The Real You is a complete novel of approximately 80,000 words.     -- It is a lighthearted contemporary YA romance written in third person, and follows both Rourke’s and Dallas’s points of view.     -- There is no cliffhanger ending.     -- It contains PG-13-rated content (mild cursing, kissing).  Associated Titles  -- While The Real You may be enjoyed on its own as a stand-alone novel, it shares a setting with, and features some characters from, Elizabeth’s previous novels, Fear and Laundry and Fear and Laundry 2, also available now.    -- The Real You is followed by the novella A Very Merry Carreen Halloween.

They harbor the vague suspicion that their counterparts in Prague, where the atmospheric decay of post--Cold War Europe is even more cinematically perfect, have it better. Still, they hope to find adventure, inspiration, a gold rush, or history in the making. What they actually find is a deceptively beautiful place that they often fail to understand. What does it mean to fret about your fledgling career when the man across the table was tortured by two different regimes? How does your short, uneventful life compare to the lives of those who actually resisted, fought, and died? What does your angst mean in a city still pocked with bullet holes from war and crushed rebellion?Journalist John Price finds these questions impossible to answer yet impossible to avoid, though he tries to forget them in the din of Budapest's nightclubs, in a romance with a secretive young diplomat, at the table of an elderly cocktail pianist, and in the moody company of a young man obsessed with nostalgia. Arriving in Budapest one spring day to pursue his elusive brother, John finds himself pursuing something else entirely, something he can't quite put a name to, something that will draw him into stories much larger than himself.With humor, intelligence, masterly prose, and profound affection for both Budapest and his own characters, Arthur Phillips not only captures his contemporaries but also brilliantly renders the Hungary of past and present: the generations of failed revolutionaries and lyric poets, opportunists and profiteers, heroes and storytellers.From the Hardcover edition.

She thought about the grey-green tangled bush at the end of her street, full of cowboys and Red Indians, waiting with their guns and their bows and arrows. She thought about the Japs and the Germans and the shining sword and chocolate biscuits, and the Argonauts sailing across the ocean, and the silver trail of snails on cardboard. She thought about the princess in the film, 'How do you do, so glad you could come, how do you do' and the wonderful butterfly bathroom and poor little Karen and her beautiful red shoes. She thought about the sad smiling man with his chess set and the newsreel and her tennis ball, up and up and up in the air, high as the tallest tree in the Basin, and Uncle Paul with his hands in his pockets, and her mother's red shoe falling down down down into the deep green bush for ever.Funny, tough-minded and tender, this is the story of Matilda and her two sisters growing up in Sydney in the 1950s at the time of the Petrov Affair. Punctuated by the headlines of the time, it shows with unsettling clarity how the large events of the world can impinge on ordinary lives.'When Ursula Dubosarsky writes, the ordinary becomes fascinating: every small and unremarkable thing is imbued with the sweetest, softest charm. Reading her novels is like walking through a dream: you know you're not allowed to stay, but you don't want to leave it, and when it's gone, you can't stop thinking about it. In this beautiful story, Dubosarsky proves yet again that she is the most graceful, most original writer for young people in Australia - probably in the world.' Sonya HartnettI always want to spend more time with Ursula Dubosarsky's people. They are wise, awkward and funny, and they give off sparks of insight that I want to read aloud to whoever's near ... The Red Shoe says all sorts of juicy things about how history is laid down one sleepy afternoon, one conversation, one crisis at a time.'

The last thing she ever expected was to fall in love with one: Jesse, a nineteenth-century hottie.But when she and Paul Slater, himself a mediator of undeniable power (and dubious intent), discover that the powers they share aren't limited to helping ghosts resolve their earthly woes, but can also be used to determine whether or not they become ghosts in the first place, Suze can't help but freak.

And Paul would like nothing better than to prevent Jesse's murder, keeping him from becoming a ghost and allowing him to live a natural life at last...but in the nineteenth century. Meaning Jesse and Suze would never meet.Suddenly, Suze is faced with the most important decision of her life: allow the only guy she's ever loved to have the life he's always longed for...or keep him anchored forever in half-life at her side.

The forces of the Galactic Superiority will be back—and if the Defiant Defense Force can’t figure out a way to escape the planet, humanity’s destruction is only a matter of time. Spensa’s mission to infiltrate the Superiority unveiled the secret to their hyperdrives—a cytonic slug species called the Taynix. Now FM’s flightleader, Jorgen, has found a large group of Taynix hiding in the caverns far below Detritus’s surface.  FM and Jorgen must work together with the engineer Rig to awaken the mysterious alien Alanik and unlock the powers of the Taynix, or humanity will be trapped. With Spensa’s friend Minister Cuna of the Superiority stranded at the outpost of Sunreach, they need to figure out how to rescue her—or the Superiority government will be in the sole clutches of those who want to wipe out Detritus once and for all.

A lifelong football fan, Mara decides to hit the gridiron with her brother, Noah, and best friend, Quinn - and she turns out to be a natural. But joining the team sets off a chain of events in her small Oregon town - and within her family - that she never could have predicted.  Inspired by what they see as Mara’s political statement, four other girls join the team. Now Mara’s lumped in as one of the girls - one of the girls who can’t throw, can’t kick, and doesn’t know a fullback from a linebacker. Complicating matters is the fact that Valentina, Mara’s crush, is one of the new players, as is Carly, Mara’s nemesis - the girl Mara fought with when she was kicked off the basketball team. What results is a coming-of-age story that is at once tear-jerking and funny, thought-provoking and real, as Mara’s preconceived notions about gender, sports, sexuality, and friendship are turned upside down.  Britta Lundin’s sophomore novel will give listeners all the feels, and make them stand up and cheer.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With every touch, she experiences exactly how her loved ones will die. And after her brother's death—a death she predicted but was unable to prevent—Elise is desperate to get rid of her terrible gift, no matter the cost.  Claire Montgomery also has a unique relationship with death, mostly because she’s already dead. Technically, anyway. Claire is a vampire, and she's been assigned by the Veil to help Elise master her rare Death Oracle powers.  At first, Elise is reluctant to work with a vampire, but when she predicts a teacher’s imminent murder, she's determined to stop the violent death, even if it means sacrificing her own future to secure Claire's help.  The trouble is, Claire and Elise aren't the only paranormals in town—a killer is stalking the streets, and Claire can't seem to shake the pull she feels toward Elise, a romance that could upend the Veil’s mission. But as Elise and Claire grow closer, Elise begins to wonder—can she really trust someone tasked with securing her loyalty? Someone who could so easily kill her? Someone who might hold the key to unraveling her brother's mysterious death?   Read more Read less",10 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Respect, and perhaps, one day, even love yourself. It's the most radical decision you can make.""  Respect yourself. Love yourself. As radical a decision for an American girl to make today as it was in 1927, as radical for a student as for a spy, for a printer's apprentice as for a poker player. It's a radical decision when you're balancing on the tightrope of being a second-generation immigrant, of neurodivergence, of facing down American racism while loving America. It's the only decision when you've weighed society's expectations and found them wanting.  With respect and love, twelve of the most talented writers working in young adult literature today--an impressive sisterhood that includes Marieke Nijkamp, Meg Medina, and Anna-Marie McLemore--have created a century and a half of heroines on the margins and in the intersections, young women of all colors and creeds standing up for themselves and their beliefs. They are ignoring their mothers' well-meant advice and forging their own paths--whether secretly learning Hebrew in early Savannah, using the family magic to pass as white in 1920s Hollywood, or singing in a feminist punk band in 1980s Boston. And they're asking you to join them.  This description comes from the publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

That is, until their revelry is interrupted by the arrival of the Norters. Shocked and scared, the Spire wizards challenge Aargh’s leadership, looking for answers (and, more importantly, someone to blame). However, Aargh, who must deal with problems of his own, is nowhere to be found! Determined to locate him, Holly-Mine sets out into the night, facing the dangers of the world alone.  Captive aboard the Marauders’ ship, Aargh struggles to regain his magical powers. When all seems lost, help comes from an unlikely place. With the aid of his new familiar, Aargh rediscovers his magical powers only to learn how dire the situation is. Aargh’s wizarding skill has only begun to be tested, and no one, least of all Aargh, knows if he will be up to the task!  AGE AND GRADE RANGE:  Although classified as YA Fantasy, the Wizard's Diary is enjoyed by readers of all ages (middle grades to adult). The books are fast-paced and filled with an array of characters from epic heroes to dangerous and deceptive villains.  WHAT ARE REVIEWERS SAYING?  Bradshaw weaves an absorbing young adult fantasy yarn that sparks with an adventurous spirit...  If you're a fan of movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean, you're going to love The Sword Guildebrande. Author Robert J. Bradshaw weaves an absorbing young adult fantasy yarn that sparks with an adventurous spirit, making it a blast to read. The plot moves quickly, taking unexpected twists and turns that keep you thoroughly engaged. The characters are vividly described and full of life. Their colorful personalities burst from the pages and keep you entertained until the end. Aargh, Holly-Mine, and Bram were my favorite characters from the bunch. Despite being the second installment of The Wizard's Diary Series, The Sword Guildebrande also functions as a standalone novel. I would highly recommend it to young adult fantasy lovers. - PIKASHO DEKA  A rare fantasy adventure that puts a unique spin on the genre  The Sword Guildebrande is a fine example of nonlinear storytelling with shifting points in time that are not confusing. Aargh’s diary entries will serve as your guide in the whole exposition. More importantly, Robert J. Bradshaw has created a wizard protagonist that is lovable and one that you can identify with and care about. Aargh is a wizard with flaws, but this is beneficial for him because it gives him that vulnerability necessary to make a character relatable. The story’s tension builds up slowly, and when it suddenly appears, expect it to keep you on your toes. The Sword Guildebrande is a rare fantasy adventure that puts a unique spin on the genre because it shows how deep one can go in plotting that is not limited to magical spectacles. It’s a great read, one that deconstructs an unusual wizard hero. - VINCENT DUBLADO   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Then, he finds himself in the Bible belt of New Brunswick, and he's not so sure. There, he meets Eleanor, who is immersed in the practical business of working hard, doing God's will, and worrying about the state of her soul.

As a child, Lily and her father traveled to the island every summer. But why would her father want her to go now, without him? Regardless of his motives, Lily seizes on the opportunity to get away for a while and regroup. Once on the island, she lands a summer job at a bookstore; finds a new friend in Regina, a fun-spirited teacher looking for adventure; and becomes inundated with childhood memories. Yet matters of the heart begin to ensnare her when she meets Ryan, a handsome, shy young man who instantly captivates her.

It was her release from the pressures of growing up and her escape from feeling like she didn?t fit in. One day, while sitting and creating illustrations in the cemetery across from her family?s house, ""special"" took on a whole new meaning for Janie when her drawing revealed a hidden message from beyond the grave. Soon Janie and her best friend Bobby Wu, wonder and doubt her special abilities, but after a successful test in the cemetery, Bobby comes up with a plan to take it to the next level. Janie and her friend seek an answer to the greatest secret ever carried to the grave. ""Was he the lone gunman?""Can Janie really receive messages from beyond the grave, and if so, can the messages help Janie?s new friend, Keith? These questions and many more are answered in the Cemetery Girl, the first book of a planned trilogy by Joseph Cognard and his daughters. When the idea for Cemetery Girl first came to author Joseph Cognard, a native New Yorker, he thought of a perfect and familiar setting for his plot, the cemetery capital of the world: the New York City borough of Queens. Cemetery Girl is the father/daughters collaboration. The illustrations and coloring throughout the book are created by Cognard?s daughters Gabriella and Marisa, who are also his inspiration.

The Harvey Award nominated sensation that rocked the comics world and left readers hanging in sheer suspense is now a full-length graphic novel that finally carries the stunning Elk's Run saga to its shocking conclusion.  The town of Elk's Ridge, West Virginia, was built on a dream: The dream of war-scarred Vietnam veterans to live in peace and harmony, in a place untouched by violence, crime, corruption, or greed. A living Norman Rockwell painting, governed by the most basic values and free of all things considered undesirable by its founders. It was supposed to be paradise. And for a while, it was.  Over the years, some in Elk's Ridge have grown restless. They fear their refuge has become a prison... or a tomb. And they yearn to do the forbidden: escape. But when one desperate bid for freedom ends in a tragic accident, a heinous act of mob justice suddenly tears the idyllic mask from this promised land and the evil its residents sought to keep out blooms from within. Now, as a deadly chain reaction of events threatens the future of Elk's Ridge, its elders gird for battle against the real world. And a group of terrified teens prepare to make their own stand against the people they once trusted and the only life they've ever known. Because there's nothing left to do but fight or die.

Ophelia Rojas knows what she likes: her best friends, Cuban food, rose-gardening, and boys - way too many boys. Her friends and parents make fun of her endless stream of crushes, but Ophelia is a romantic at heart. She couldn't change, even if she wanted to.  So when she finds herself thinking more about cute, quiet Talia Sanchez than the loss of a perfect prom with her ex-boyfriend, seeds of doubt take root in Ophelia's firm image of herself. Add to that the impending end of high school and the fracturing of her once-solid friend group, and things are spiraling a little out of control. But the course of love--and sexuality--never did run smooth. As her secrets begin to unravel, Ophelia must make a choice between clinging to the fantasy version of herself she's always imagined or upending everyone's expectations to rediscover who she really is, after all.

The peaceful indigenous peoples fled before the marauding hordes and hid defiantly in the mountain peaks awaiting a signal from god. They learned the arts of magic and warfare as they hid from the intruders, who divided the land amongst themselves and set up a civilization where the many toil and slave for the elite few.The Forgotten Legacy series begins with Young Lord of Khadora as Marak, a young soldier in the service of one of the clans of Khadora is chosen as a sacrifice for the benefit of his lord. Marak is sent on a fool’s mission to defeat one of the small bands of indigenous people known as the Chula, a race of dreaded cat-people.Marak, however, is not your normal clan soldier. His mother is a mage slave to the clan lord and his father is unknown, presumed dead. What makes Marak different though, is his abhorrence for Khadoran culture, a society that feeds on the helpless and victimizes all but the most wealthy and powerful. Refusing to accept his given role in life, Marak sets out to change the very fabric of society.The young soldier has a brilliant military mind and warrior skills that so far have not been bested, but his real weapons are the resources that Khadoran society discards. In Khadora mages are typically slaves who tend the fields, often thought of as little more than farm implements. The average Khadoran soldier is taught to follow orders and not think. The workers on the clan estates are treated barely better than the slaves.Marak intends to use a secret weapon to not only accomplish the futile mission he is sent on, but to start a reform of the entire society. His weapon is compassion and it is an emotion that has long been dead in Khadora.It is a fine edge that Marak must walk to stay alive. While not knowing how a populace will react to his endeavors, Marak has little doubt what the reactions of the clan lords will be.

All the rules of time-travel he's experienced so far have been broken and Jackson has no choice but to pretend to be his younger self whilst he figures out a solution. Jackson is tearing himself apart with guilt and frustration, wondering if Holly survived. He's also become the target of a enemy force he cannot even begin to comprehend and it seems even his dad is lying to him. Jackson is racing against time to save the girl he loves, discover the truth about his family and, most importantly, understand why he can time travel and who wants him dead.

A few years later, California's economy collapses, but Marcus's hacktivist past lands him a job as webmaster for a crusading politician who promises reform. Soon his former nemesis Masha emerges from the political underground to gift him with a thumbdrive containing a Wikileaks-style cable-dump of hard evidence of corporate and governmental perfidy. It's incendiary stuff—and if Masha goes missing, Marcus is supposed to release it to the world. Then Marcus sees Masha being kidnapped by the same government agents who detained and tortured Marcus years earlier.  Marcus can leak the archive Masha gave him—but he can't admit to being the leaker, because that will cost his employer the election. He's surrounded by friends who remember what he did a few years ago and regard him as a hacker hero. He can't even attend a demonstration without being dragged onstage and handed a mike. He's not at all sure that just dumping the archive onto the Internet, before he's gone through its millions of words, is the right thing to do.  Meanwhile, people are beginning to shadow him, people who look like they're used to inflicting pain until they get the answers they want.  Fast-moving, passionate, and as current as next week, Homeland is every bit the equal of Little Brother—a paean to activism, to courage, to the drive to make the world a better place.

Frustrated by racial taunts, pelted with banana skins during his last game, black soccer player Sonny Johnson snaps, committing a violent crime on the very same day the heat wave of 1976 breaks in a massive thunderstorm. In one fell swoop, Sonny's teenage son Geoffhurst loses all the superheroes in his life: his glamorous, headstrong mother (dead), his gang the Four Aces (dissolved), his father (jailed), and the Incredible Hulk (outgrown). Only his witchcraft-working Aunt Harriet remains, and it is through her lyrical story of Caribbean immigrant life and unrequited love that we uncover the seeds of Sonny's rage. Filled with Technicolor details and street-smart language, Lazy Eye focuses on the fine line between cultural integration and personal disintegration.

For as long as she can remember, Samantha Song has dreamed of writing for a high-society magazine—and she’d do anything to get there. But the constant struggle to help her mom make ends meet and her low social status cause her dream to feel like a distant fantasy.  Now Samantha finds herself working at a drab PR firm. Living vicariously through her wealthy coworker and friend, Anya Chen, is the closest she’ll get to her ideal life. Until she meets Timothy Kingston: the disillusioned son of one of Singapore’s elite families—and Samantha’s one chance at infiltrating the high-society world to which she desperately wants to belong.  To Samantha’s surprise, Timothy and Anya both agree to help her make a name for herself on Singapore’s socialite scene. But the borrowed designer clothes and plus-ones to every glamorous event can only get her so far. The rest is on Samantha, and she’s determined to impress the editor in chief of Singapore’s poshest magazine. But the deeper Samantha wades into this fraud, the more she fears being exposed—especially with a mysterious gossip columnist on the prowl for dirt—forcing her to reconcile her pretense with who she really is before she loses it all.

Anneke's life changes in 1942 when the Nazis invade Holland, and she and her family are deported to Theresienstadt, a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia.

Sports is the language of business. Like it or not, a 30-second sports conversation can open more doors and connect you with a larger audience than your resume. Talent and skill are important, but the ability to communicate and connect with others plays a significant role in your success. The greatest ideas and the best inventions will go unnoticed and unused if you can't tell the world--or worse--no one listens when you try. This book demonstrates how sports conversations and sports fandom will get you noticed, connected and communicating more effectively. Add that up and you're looking at more opportunities and greater successes.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sales organizations that embrace applied psychology and testing become more competitive because they don't waste resources on irrelevant or counterproductive activities. Managers can better assess the reasons behind individual and group performance and predictably improve sales results, while fostering a sales culture that attracts and retains personnel who have the personality and motivation to be successful.Scientific Selling includes more than a dozen specific stories demonstrating how scientific measurement improved overall sales performance through easily understood graphics, charts, and descriptions. It details how those teams were measured and how those metrics changed as the result of better hiring practices and better targeted coaching and sales training.  Through these detailed case studies, Scientific Selling illustrates the importance of measurement for steering the success of your company. The book:  Describes how the Clark-Mortenson Agency used scientifically proven data-based assessment tools to provide individual sales professionals with a very specific overview to determine their current strengths and areas of growth  Examines Meadowbrook Golf's program to ""manage for individual success"" by using scientific testing and measurement to help its top managers understand what motivated their employees  Details how Yankee Candle used scientific measurement to identify the right people to hire, and then used customer case studies and role-playing to focus on leveraging each individual's natural behavior to sell, thereby creating increases of 40% in sales revenue for trained individuals  Scientific testing and measurement can leverage current strengths, identify areas for growth, and increase revenue.

It might not mean you have to pick up the golf clubs, but you do have to figure out what works in your own organization.Parlez-vous Francis? Learning Mandarin? If you work for a global company and aspire to an extreme job or higher, make it known that you would take an overseas assignment to advance your career.Nowhere to go right now? Even in hard times there are options. Learn a lateral skill—such as accounting—so when the company is firing on all engines again, you will impress through the breadth of your knowledge.Drawing from her work as a consultant to some of the country's most prestigious Fortune 100 companies, Dr. Bell helps readers succeed at every level in a dynamic corporate marketplace.

Simply put, when you unleash the power of personal accountability it will energize you in lifealtering ways, giving you a concrete boost that enhances your ability to think, to withstand adversity, to generate confidence, and to increase your own natural emotional, mental, and intellectual strength. Roger Connors and Tom Smith know this because they've seen it work in their own lives and witnessed it in the lives of some of the most successful and influential people in the world.  The authors first introduced this powerful accountability philosophy in the New York Times bestseller The Oz Principle. Since then, millions have come to know them as ""The Oz Guys"" and they have gone on to help leaders all over the world teach and apply the principles you're about to learn. Principles that have generated billions of dollars of wealth-along with a host of even more important results. Devotees of The Oz Principle have brought lifesaving medications to market, created better education in community colleges, greatly surpassed charity fund-raising goals, and improved medical practices in battlefield hospitals.  In The Wisdom of Oz, Connors and Smith present the practical and powerful principles of personal accountability in simple, down-to-earth terms that you can apply in your homes, schools, communities, churches, and volunteer groups. The book will help you strengthen family relationships, improve friendships, motivate children, increase value on the job, improve health and financial well-being, or achieve whatever it is you most desire.  Drawing on engaging stories about those who have overcome great odds-including South African president Nelson Mandela, Polish WWII hero Irena Sendler, and everyday men and women-Connors and Smith demonstrate that by taking personal ownership of your goals and accepting responsibility for your performance, you also take control of your success.  You will read stories about people just like you who learned to beat their struggles, like the New York area fisherman who fell off his lobster boat and was adrift at sea for twelve hours in the chilly Atlantic. but survived. You will learn the traits that allowed a college senior who landed flat on her face in a 600-meter race to jump up and win. Or a thirteen-year-old soccer player who moved from the bench to the starting lineup.  You will discover that while no one will ever wave a wizard's wand and magically solve all your problems, there is a way to experience the near magical impact of personal accountability""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

In The Power of Onlyness, Nilofer Merchant, one of the world's top-ranked business thinkers, reveals that, in fact, we have now reached an unprecedented moment of opportunity for your ideas to 'make a dent' on the world. Now that the Internet has liberated ideas to spread through networks instead of hierarchies, power is no longer determined by your status, but by 'onlyness'—that spot in the world only you stand in, a function of your distinct history and experiences, visions and hopes. If you build upon your signature ingredient of purpose and connect with those who are equally passionate, you have a lever by which to move the world. This new ability is already within your grasp, but to command it, you need to know how to meaningfully mobilize others around your ideas. Through inspirational and instructive stories, Merchant reveals proven strategies to unleash the centrifugal force of a new idea, no matter how weird or wild it may seem"" --Amazon.com.

In Fully Alive, Tyler Gage shares his spiritual adventures and the business savvy that helped him create RUNA, a tea and energy drink company that collaborates with the indigenous people of Ecuador to harvest the ""master plant"" guayusa, revealing a centuries-old guiding philosophy for building a sacred way of living that he discovered through Amazonian shamanism. Following these teachings, what began as a humble start-up has now grown into a thriving, multi-million dollar company, selling products in more than 10,000 stores across the United States and Canada. With the help of collaborators like Channing Tatum, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Olivia Wilde, RUNA has created a sustainable source of income for the 3,000 farming families in Ecuador who grow guayusa organically, while also establishing a nonprofit organization dedicated to positively impacting the issues that affect these indigenous communities. Packed with practical and inspiring lessons, this book offers a comprehensive examination of how we too might become ""fully alive,"" both in business and as individuals""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But innovative thinking requires a steady stream of fresh ideas and new possibilities, which strangers are more likely to introduce. Our survival instincts naturally cause us to look upon strangers with suspicion and distrust, but in The Necessity of Strangers, Alan Gregerman offers the provocative idea that engaging with strangers is an opportunity, not a threat, and that engaging with the right strangers is essential to unlocking our real potential. The Necessity of Strangers reveals how strangers challenge us to think differently about ourselves and the problems we face.  Shows how strangers can help us innovate better, get the most out of each other, and achieve genuine collaboration  Presents principles for developing a ""stranger-centric"" mindset to develop new markets and stronger customer relationships, leverage the full potential of partnerships, and become more effective leaders  Includes practical guidance and a toolkit for being more open, creating new ideas that matter, finding the right strangers in all walks of life, and tapping the real brilliance in yourself  To stay competitive, you and your business need access to more new ideas, insights, and perspectives than ever before.

In today's uncertain economic environment, teams are asked to do more with less. With resources stretched thin, turning around a struggling team has never been harder, and managers must work to identify and maximize whatever potential strengths a team already has. As sports fans already know, behind every great underdog story is a leader who roots out the competitive advantage that will propel the team to victory. In Team Turnarounds, Joe Frontiera and Dan Leidl share how this fine art of the turnaround really works, from how to inspire the team to the actual tools for change. Through interviews with team managers and turnaround masters in the NFL, MLB, and the NCAA, as well as managers at top global firms who have successfully reversed their fortunes, they show the six steps every team takes to make a 180 in their performance.  Presents a six-step model for turnarounds in any organization, based on the authors' extensive research with owners and general managers of sport franchises in the MLB, NFL, and NBA. Features first-hand accounts of sport turnarounds, from the legendary worst-to-first story of Bill Polian and the Indianapolis Colts to Jeffrey Lurie's efforts to transform the Philadelphia Eagles.     Offers behind-the-scenes accounts of effective turnarounds at major organizations like Dominos Pizza, Juniper Networks, iContact, and the Broadway play, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.

Our business idols unfortunately are falling like nine-pins. So whom do we draw inspiration from as we manage people and processes in our organizations? Dr. Cecil Clements examines the challenges you face in your corporate workplace-from winning against cutthroat competition to effectively handling stress; from working in unethical environments to handling defeat and burnouts. The Bible has unparalleled insights on all this and more. Let's cut the management jargon; let's choose wisdom from the one source that matters the most-God. Corporate Capsules is the platform that helps transform you from just another ambitious manager running the rat race, to an inspired leader, fulfilling your potential and raison d'être."" -- Back cover.

And of course he had no idea he would become the most famous skateboarder of all time, let alone the head of several successful related businesses. The same focus that drove him to pick himself up off the pavement again and again, that kept him riding through skating's lean times, and that fueled his celebrated ten-year quest to land the elusive 900 (two-and-a-half midair rotations), also helped him build his brand into a worldwide empire. From skateboards to clothing to sports tours to video games to online media, Tony Hawk has dominated markets with a laid-back style that masks his formidable business sense. Now, in How Did I Get Here?, Tony reveals the convictions that enable him to navigate between the skateboard and the boardroom. How Did I Get Here? takes you back to Tony's first business, the still-thriving Birdhouse Skateboards, which he and a friend started long before he had mainstream fame. He describes the lessons he learned (some of them hard) building Birdhouse on little more than a home-equity loan and the street cred he'd gained within the tight skating subculture of the '80s. You'll also find out how, by staying true to his passion and his instincts, he's been able to build his businesses into a global juggernaut. Whether working with tiny skate shops or national chains like Kohl's, Tony found long-term success by insisting on authenticity. You'll see how he very consciously brings skating's homegrown style, DIY ethos, and underground heroes to each of his enterprises-from start-up Web sites to mega-selling video games. True to Tony's twisted sense of humor, How Did I Get Here? also doesn't flinch from what didn't work (pink backpacks, anyone?), recounting his entrepreneurial mishaps in gruesome detail. Tony Hawk is living proof that you can stay close to your roots while going big in business. Discover the secrets to his success-everything from brand strategy to the real meaning of ""Boom Boom HuckJam""-as Tony answers the question How Did I Get Here?

Since the number one factor in employee success is the relationship between employees and their immediate managers, employees need to take greater responsibility for getting the most out of that relationship. Drawing on years of experience training managers and employees, Tulgan reveals the four essential things employees should get from their bosses  to guarantee success at work. Shows employees how to ask for what they need to succeed in their high-pressure jobs. Shatters previously held beliefs about how employees should manage up. Outlines what employees must get from their managers: clear expectations; the skills needed to perform their jobs; honest feedback, recognition or rewards. A novel approach to managing up, It's Okay to Manage Your Boss is an invaluable resource for employees who want to work more effectively with their managers.""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The title metaphor conveys the core concept: though a starfish and a spider have similar shapes, their internal structure is dramatically different—a decapitated spider inevitably dies, while a starfish can regenerate itself from a single amputated leg. In the same way, decentralized organizations, like the Internet, the Apache Indian tribe and Alcoholics Anonymous, are made up of many smaller units capable of operating, growing and multiplying independently of each other, making it very difficult for a rival force to control or defeat them. Despite familiar examples—eBay, Napster and the Toyota assembly line, for example—there are fresh insights, such as the authors' three techniques for combating a decentralized competitor (drive change in your competitors' ideology, force them to become centralized or decentralize yourself). The authors also analyze one of today's most worrisome ""starfish"" organizations—al-Qaeda—though that group undermines the authors' point that the power of leaderless groups helps to demonstrate the essential goodness and trustworthiness of human beings.

Bestselling social historian Charles Murray has written a delightfully fussy -- and entertaining -- book on the hidden rules of the road in the workplace, and in life, from the standpoint of an admonishing, but encouraging, workplace grouch and taskmaster. Why the curmudgeon? The fact is, most older, more senior people over us in the workplace are closet curmudgeons. In today's politically correct world, they may hide their displeasure over your misuse of grammar, or your overly familiar use of their first name without an express invitation. But don't be fooled by their pleasant demeanor. Underneath, they are judging and evaluating your every move and utterance. And in most cases, if you want to advance in your career, it is their approval that you need to win.  In the course of this pithy and powerful book, Murray tells us the proper etiquette for email, how to stop using such overused and fuzzy phrases as ""reaching out"" and ""sharing"", his thoughts on piercings and tattoos and proper dress, the importance of rigor in language and good writing, why being judgmental is good, and other curmudgeonly pieces of wisdom and advice. He suggests how to stand out at work (work long hours when you are young and unencumbered by family and other obligations), when to use strong language and when to avoid it, and offers a bare-bones usage primer on how to avoid confusing words like ""advice"" and ""advise,"" which look or sound similar, but have distinct meanings.  Written with both verve and reserve, and drawing on the core values that have historically made good manners the best lubricant to social and professional advancement, The Curmudgeon's Guide is an invaluable resource for anyone hoping to land the job of their dreams, or get ahead in their career of choice""--  ""n the bestselling tradition of Eats, Shoot and Leaves, a gently curmudgeonly but invaluable guide to the dos and don'ts of the workplace.

In Reinvent Your Business Model, Mark Johnson reveals the playbook. Johnson lays out an eminently practical framework that identifies the four fundamental building blocks that make business models work. In a series of in-depth case studies, he goes on to vividly illustrate how companies are using innovative business models to achieve transformational growth by - fulfilling unmet customer needs in their current markets - serving entirely new customers and creating new markets - and responding to tectonic shifts in market demand, government policy, and technologies that affect entire industries. He then lays out a structured process for designing a new model and developing it into a profitable and thriving enterprise, while investigating the vexing and sometimes paradoxical managerial challenges that have commonly thwarted so many companies in their unguided forays into the unknown. Business model innovators have reshaped entire sectors--including retail, aviation, and media--and redistributed billions of dollars of value. With road-tested frameworks, analytics, and diagnostics, this book gives executives everything they need to reshape their businesses and achieve transformative growth. Thoroughly updated to, Johnson has also added a new chapter on digital transformation, that presents a framework for digital business models and four new case studies.--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What qualities do the men and women at the top of the world's best-run companies have in common? What lessons can they teach other managers and CEOs?Thomas J. Neff and James M. Citrin provide the answers to these vital questions in Lessons from the Top. Using the most exacting standards imaginable, and employing the research expertise of the Gallup Organization and the analytical tools of investment advisers Lazard Freres, they selected the fifty best executives in business today and interviewed them about their long-term strategies, career milestones, key accomplishments, and guiding beliefs. The result is an unparalleled course in what it takes to create a successful, well-organized company in any industry. Lessons from the Top profiles such well-known people as Jack Welch, Bill Gates, Lou Gerstner, and Andy Grove, as well as less familiar figures like Bill Steere of Pfizer, Shelly Lazarus of Ogilvy & Mather, Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco International, and Frank Raines of Fannie Mae. In the final section of the book, the authors distill the qualities these accomplished individuals share, as well as delineate six essential principles of business leadership. A winning combination of entertaining stories about life at the top (and how to get there) and rigorous business insights, Lessons from the Top received high praise when it was published in hardcover and went back to press six times. With a new Introduction, the paperback edition will bring its important lessons to an even wider audienceFrom the Trade Paperback edition.

But as access to big data becomes ubiquitous, it can no longer guarantee a leg up. Fast/Forward makes the case that we are entering a new era in which firms that understand the limits of 1s and 0s will take the lead. Whereas the industrial age saw the rise of bureaucracy, and the information age has been described as a meritocracy, we are witnessing the rise of adhocracy. In uncertain, rapidly-changing times, adhocracic organisations scan the horizon for winning opportunities. Then, instead of questing after more analysis, they respond with agility by making smart, intuitive decisions. Combining decisive action with emotional conviction, future-facing firms seize the day. Fast/Forward paints the big picture of a new approach to strategy and provides the necessary playbook to make your company fit for the future."" -- Provided by publisher.

""Disruption is the key to innovation. Whether you run a one-man startup or a global business behemoth, the only way to win big is by relentlessly rethinking the rules of your industry - no matter how tried-and-true they are. InSimply Brilliant, the visionary co-founder of Fast Company William C. Taylor goes behind the scenes at nineteen organizations that are revolutionizing their otherwise humdrum fields. These unlikely agents of change range from a parking garage that also serves as a wedding venue to a military insurance company that puts salespeople through simulated overseas deployment. What these businesses have in common, Taylor discovers, is a shared set of principles that enable them to pioneer disruptive innovation. By embracing these practical and often counter-intuitive strategies, leaders in any industry will be well on their way to upending the status quo and finding opportunity where competitors didn't or couldn't look."" -- Provided by publisher.

Why it's better to be a profit leader than a market leader.  Differentiation and price premiums.  How to map your brand on the matrix of relevance and differentiation.  How to define a value proposition that will make your firm intensely appealing to the customers who want you for what you do best.        Based on the proven premise that the most profitable business strategy is not to aim at the center of the market, but rather at the edges, Positioning for Professionals is written for leaders, managers, and other senior executives of service companies in with a particular emphasis on professional service firms.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Do less better,John Richard Bell,success_in_business,First published in 2014,/works/OL20000920W,/authors/OL7600781A/John_Richard_Bell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 228,"""In Do Less Better, John Bell draws on personal experiences from his days in the C-suite and the boardrooms of his consulting clients. He culls his experience to make a convincing case that, in business, sacrifice is the surprising secret to successful focus and long-term viability. Business complexity has never been greater, but it is not the phenomenon itself but rather the inability to cut through the clutter that comes in the way of resurrecting clarity and coherence. Bell demonstrates how the best business strategies all require this sacrifice. He emphasizes, through case studies and personal anecdotes, the importance of specializing--of a company's willingness to focus on a particular area, vision, or identity in order to create and maintain its value. According to Bell, the specialist always beats the generalist. Doing less, better ensures viability and strengthens a company's competitive edge. Do Less Better will teach business leaders how to keep their company nimble--willing and able to sacrifice and evolve in order to remain relevant and competitive. This smart sacrifice and nimbleness--dumping a pet project that's not profitable anymore, taking your partner's name off the door, altering some beloved company formulae, for example--can be incredibly difficult. However, maintaining this prioritization of nimbleness is crucial as it gives you a hugely significant advantage over companies that are more reactive and slow-to-change. Bell shows business leaders how, in a corporation, you don't have to be an entrepreneur to think like one. But he also asserts that, in order to act like one, you'll have to sacrifice your aversion to risk. You'll have to fight off certain strongly-help or sacred inclinations, such as the tendency to generalize rather than specialize and the desire to preserve and maintain (practices, products, ways of doing business) rather than sacrifice, let go, and innovate. He discusses several disciplines and examples in entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing and branding that help to clear the fog of company complexity. Within problem/solution scenarios, he demonstrate how people and companies succeed or fail at these practices. According to Bell, doing less, better should by no means lead to doing less work. More often than not, those who embrace the notion of focus, specialization, and streamlining work harder because they are more passionate and emotionally connected to their vision. This is a book for business leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs who are just starting out and need help embracing the practices and philosophy that will allow them to be lean, farsighted, adaptable, and resilient. It is also a book for leaders of established business, who are looking to reduce clutter and encumbering complexity in order to stay nimble and focused enough to maintain a competitive edge. ""--  ""Doing less, better is by no means doing less work. More often than not, those who embrace the notion of focus work harder because they are more passionate and emotionally connected to the vision. In the middle of the book, Bell discusses several disciplines and examples in entrepreneurship, strategy, marketing and branding that help to clear the fog of complexity. Within problem/solution scenarios, he demonstrates how people and companies succeed or fail at these practices. The final chapters address the importance of human capital, and restate the fact that business enterprises perish with rudderless leadership and morose cultures. Without strategy, survival is possible but seldom over the long haul. Corporate coherence is the critical performance component, especially for large companies. While we can expect a certain level of bureaucracy within the giants, the ""keep it simple, stupid"" KISS rule can still prevail, by SBU, by department, by team, by individual employee. Leaders and followers must strive for focus in everything they do. Bell concludes the book with a summary of the valuable lessons he learned in the trenches and battlefields of a 40 year business career""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What's actually going on in our brains when we make these judgments? Through original research, customer loyalty expert Chris Malone and top social psychologist Susan Fiske discovered that our perceptions arise from spontaneous judgments on warmth and competence, the same two factors that also determine our impressions of people. We see companies and brands the same way we automatically perceive, judge, and behave toward one another. As a result, to achieve sustained success, companies must forge genuine relationships with customers. And as customers, we have a right to expect relational accountability from the companies and brands we support. Applies the social psychology concepts of ""warmth"" (what intentions others have toward us) and ""competence"" (how capable they are of carrying out those intentions) to the way we perceive and relate to companies and brands Features in-depth analyses of companies such as Hershey's, Domino's, Lululemon, Zappos, Amazon, Chobani, Sprint, and more Draws from original research, evaluating over 45 companies over the course of 10 separate studies The Human Brand is essential reading for understanding how and why we make the choices we do, as well as what it takes for companies and brands to earn and keep our loyalty in the digital age""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why are obvious changes so hard to make? Are you pursuing too many top priorities? How do you avoid irrational traps without getting bogged down by over-analysis? Why Quitters Win reveals why Nick Tasler's elegantly simple 3-part strategic behavior framework is already driving excellence for everyone from Fortune 500 executives and middle managers to busy moms, small business owners and church leaders. Decades of research in social science and business strategy, as well as Tasler's own findings from surveying the decisions of hundreds of thousands of working adults reveal that the most successful people, teams, and companies are not those with access to the widest variety of opportunities or the steadiest supply of creative ideas. Surprisingly, the opposite is true. Too many exciting opportunities, good ideas, and top priorities erode our focus, confuse our teams, and keep us swirling around on a plateau of mediocrity. Why Quitters Win addresses these critical topics with a brilliantly simple approach that has the power to profoundly change your life ... one decision at a time""--Amazon.com, viewed April 21, 2014.

Everyone knows about blogs and social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and has heard about someone who has used them to grow a huge customer base. Everyone wants to be hands-on, grassroots, and interactive, but what does this mean? And more to the point, how do you do it? As one who has actually launched a company using the power of online communities, and who now advises large and small companies, Tara Hunt (named by the San Francisco Chronicle, along with luminaries Jimmy Wales and Tim O’Reilly, as a digital Utopian) is the perfect person to do this book. While The Whuffie Factor will traverse the landscape of Web 2.0 and show how to become a player, it is not just another book about online marketing. People see the huge business potential of the online world and the first impulse is: Let’s throw a bunch of money at it. To which Tara Hunt says: ""Stop! Money isn’t the capital of choice in online communities, it is whuffie–social capital–and how to raise it is at the heart of this book."" In the Web 2.0 world, market capital flows from having high social capital. Without whuffie you lose your connections and any recommendations you make will be seen as spam–met with negative reactions and a loss of social capital. The Whuffie Factor provides businesspeople with a strategic map and specific tactics for the constantly evolving, elusive, and, to some, strange world of online communities. By connecting with your customers through community interaction, you’ll raise your social capital, create demand, and sell more product. Consumer loyalty is a direct result of whuffie. With great stories of online business successes and cautionary tales of major missteps -- recording industry, anyone? -- Tara Hunt reveals how social networking has more influence over buying decisions than any other marketing tool and how your business can tap into the vast world of Web 2.0 to build an unshakable foundation for twenty-first-century-style online success. - Publisher.

The book presents ground-breaking new insights and practical examples from a range of growing family businesses in which the owning families are visible and, in most cases, have branded the business with their family name. This comprehensive and important study explores how family identity has the power to tie together families in business and leverage their values when developing and sharing the owners vision with their stakeholder communities. Developing a family business identity is key when building and managing an authentic, recognizable and trusted brand. It argues that family businesses that have successfully translated strong identities into strong brands are not only perceived as attractive employers but also add meaningful value to the business over generations. .

But nonprofit institutions are different; they aim for social profit. But how do you measure the success of a social profit institution, where missions are focused on the well-being of people, place, and planet? It is one of the most difficult tasks faced by nonprofit administrations, who find themselves confused, even paralyzed, by the current demand for outcomes measurement, a phrase used by most foundations and funding agencies, and increasingly by individual donors. The Social Profit Handbook gives those who lead, govern, and support social profit organizations both a different way to think about assessment and a very practical approach to implementing formative assessment practices practices whose purpose is not about judging work that has already happened, but rather about improving work that will happen in the future. Readers looking to improve planning and outcomes will find new insights and strategies from backward planning to applied rubrics.

In the workplace today there's a glass wall. Men and women can see each other clearly through the divide, but they don't speak the same language or have the same expectations. And as a result, women and their careers are suffering. With more women than ever in the workforce, but still too few in the boardroom, now is the time to address the assumptions and miscommunication holding women back. This book gives women the tools they need to master any situation. Drawing on Unerman and Jacob's own experience in male-dominated businesses, as well as over a hundred interviews with both men and women, The Glass Wall provides clear, smart and easy-to apply strategies for success. From unlocking ambition and developing resilience to nurturing creativity and getting noticed, these are the skills that everyone needs to learn to help break down that wall and create better workplaces for all.""--Publisher's description.

What Gary Hirshberg saw early on was that organic isnt just about food. Its a way of thinking that embraces cyclical, non-linear resource use where waste from one action becomes food for another. The company has enjoyed a compounded annual growth rate of more than 26 percent for 13 straight years, while the yogurt category as a whole has grown at a much slower pace of 6-8 percent. In this book, Hirshberg shares the secrets that helped his company skyrocket to success, and argues that traditional business practices are ultimately counterproductive and have helped create many of the problems that threaten to make the world uninhabitable. Hirshberg will explain how Stonyfields counterintuitive way of doing business demonstrates that companies can be environmentally conscious, and will prove that in doing so, they can make bigger profits than their more conventional counterparts. This book will appeal both to consumers who want quality and a better world, and companies who want steady profits and growth.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A partir de esta frase se desarrolla el conflicto de un atribulado empresario que, a punto de sufrir un infarto a causa de las presiones laborales y de su falta de dominio sobre sí mismo, se ve en la necesidad de acudir a un guía espiritual que se encarga de ""sanar"" sus males, abriéndole el camino hacia la felicidad. Y es que el ser humano de hoy se encuentra sometido a un ritmo de vida que con frecuencia lo lleva a olvidarse de sí mismo. La velocidad con que debe responder a los estímulos del exterior, la lucha por afirmar la propia individualidad en ámbitos laborales hostiles, la competencia y la presión de los mercados, el consumo indiscriminado de información y de productos comerciales, las presiones de trabajo, llegan a abarcar todo el ámbito de su vida, anulando el espacio para la paz y la reflexión, aspectos tan vitales como escasos hoy día.--Descripción de la editorial.

It is as natural as breathing, and just as necessary for leading a successful and fulfilling life. Creative solutions are required because the status quo is never good enough, and our goal should always be to push beyond the limits of what seems possible. Great ideas are needed to solve all the problems we face and to enrich our lives. Whether it is in the conference room, classroom, or kitchen, new ideas open up a world of wonderful possibilities. With the tools presented in the following chapters, we will learn how to pull out all stops to take on the challenges, big and small, that come our way, and to see that every word, every idea, and every moment provides an opportunity for creativity that will enhance our lives. The following chapters are filled with concepts, tools, techniques, and stories that reveal ways you can increase your creativity quotient, and that of your groups and organizations. The first half of the book focuses on the inside out - what you can personally do to increase your own creative aptitude and attitude. The second half deals with the outside in - how you can change the local and cultural environment to increase the creativity quotient of your community. InGenious reveals one of the great truths about ideas and that is it costs nothing to generate amazing ideas, and yet the results have the potential to be priceless""--   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Constructing career scripts,Sharon Belden,success_in_business,First published in 2009,/works/OL33255633W,/authors/OL12045503A/Sharon_Belden,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Language English|Pages 170,"Studying career scripts can reveal how individuals make sense of their careers within specific cultural contexts and time periods. For this study, I examine the career scripts of Generation X, a cohort who has weathered considerable job market upheaval. I look at how members of Generation X define their career scripts; how their perceptions of how those scripts map onto the career paths of those in their own and previous generations; and whether they see discrepancies between their own career scripts and those of their generation, or those of prior generations, within their professions. I interviewed ten men and ten women who graduated from college between 1991 and 1996, a job market low point for new graduates. They worked in a variety of industries, including consulting and business services, financial services and insurance, new media, and nonprofit management. They also represented a wide range of functional areas of business, including marketing, human resources, finance, and entrepreneurship.  The career scripts participants described both complement and further existing research regarding Generation X. Starting out, they followed a path of least resistance, taking opportunities where they could find them. They then searched for satisfying work that would allow for growth and autonomy, while still allowing them to maintain the lifestyles they chose outside of work. I did not find gender differences in their scripts: both men and women made career decisions based on what they felt was best for themselves and their young families, and women were as likely as men to be primary breadwinners. In general, they did not see their experiences as unique relative to their peers, either within or outside their professions. They did, however, recognize the changes in the rules and the playing field for conducting one's business career in comparison to prior generations. As such, they did not take occupational setbacks personally, or as a reflection of their worth as business people. This represents a departure from prior generations. They were practicing a unique form of meritocratic individualism. They saw success as based on individual achievement, but as defined by the individual, not by an organization, or by society at large.

Starting from a young age, fired by boundless energy and optimism, we launch into our careers sure of our abilities. Yet, things do not always turn out as we expect they would. It is not our abilities alone. The business environment is one of change and ambiguity. It is no easy task for any manager to negotiate the journey to success. As Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, points out in his foreword, partnerships with others, but above all with your direct boss and organization, are more important than ever before. Not only that, a good boss has an instinct for the right people, and getting them to do better. A good manager, by eliciting his help, helps himself. Few people are better qualified to guide on this journey than R. Gopalakrishnan. He brings forty-five years of experience to this subject in some of the most challenging jobs. In this immensely practical book informed by the wisdom he has gleaned over the years, he offers the reader the benefit of all he has learnt, summarized in the four As - Accomplishment, Affability, Advocacy and Authenticity. This is a book that will be of immense use to any manager, and one that just might bring him the answers it takes years to find - what the CEO really expects from him.

Studies prove that good planning practices more than double the chance of business success. Yet, the vast majority of small to medium sized businesses operate without a formal plan, and of those who do build a plan, only a handful carefully measure their targeted objectives and adjust their plans accordingly.

Curiosity might have killed the proverbial cat, but without it very real achievements would never occur. With this book as your guide, you'll learn how to spark your innate curiosity, pounce onproblems in ways you never imagined, and enjoy greater success and satisfaction at work — and in your personal life.Playful, profound, and positively upbeat, CATS provides what you need to tap into your power of innovation — and thenunleash it in every member of your organization. While most business thinkers view this challenge from the top down, Stephen Lundin sees the subject from a CAT's-eye view, explaining how to get every employee--no matter what level--to think and act in innovative ways. Inside, he examines the four challenges to innovation and offers practical measures aimed at conquering them. You'll learn how to:Be brave ('fraidy cats never innovate) Stop being 'normal' (make your own rules!)Embrace failure (it's the only way to learn)Foster creativity (don't be a control freak)Lundin then describes the Nine Lives of Innovation, each of which is a step toward realizing your inner CAT and becoming a fully contributing member of an innovative organization.Prowling inside every employee is a questioner, a creator, an innovator--claws out and ready to pounce. Become a CAT andyou may fi nd yourself springing on ideas in a way that surprises you — and everyone around you.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Christensen, now with a refreshed package.  In the international bestseller The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen exposed the Achilles' heel of many companies: by ignoring the disruptive technologies that evolve to displace them, they help initiate their own demise. In The Innovator's Solution, Christensen and Michael Raynor take the idea of disruption one step further--explaining how companies can and should become disruptors themselves.  Now with a new look, The Innovator's Solution proves just how timely and relevant these ideas continue to be in today's hyper-accelerated business environment. Christensen (author of the award-winning Harvard Business Review article, ""How Will You Measure Your Life?""), and Raynor give usable advice on the business decisions crucial to achieving truly disruptive growth and propose guidelines for developing your own disruptive growth engine.

In The Innovator's Solution, Christensen and coauthor Michael E. Raynor help all companies understand how to become disruptors themselves. Clay Christensen (author of the award-winning Harvard Business Review article, ""How Will You Measure Your Life?"") and Raynor not only reveal that innovation is more predictable than most managers have come to believe, they also provide helpful advice on the business decisions crucial to truly disruptive growth.

Patents and the survival of internet-related IPOs,Iain Cockburn,success_in_business,First published in 2007,/works/OL12233442W,/authors/OL5332401A/Iain_Cockburn,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English|Pages 33,"""We examine the effect of patenting on the survival prospects of 356 internet-related firms that IPO'd at the height of the stock market bubble of the late 1990s. By March 2005, nearly 2/3 of these firms had delisted from the NASDAQ exchange. Although changes in the legal environment in the US in the 1990s made it much easier to obtain patents on software and, ultimately, on business methods, less than half of the firms in this sample obtained, or attempted to obtain, patents. For those that did, we hypothesize that patents conferred competitive advantages that translate into higher probability of survival, though they may also simply be a signal of firm quality. Controlling for age, venture-capital backing, financial characteristics, and stock market conditions, patenting is positively associated with survival. Quite different processes appear to govern exit via acquisition compared to exit via delisting from the exchange due to business failure. Firms that applied for more patents were less likely to be acquired, though obtaining unusually highly cited patents may make them more attractive acquisition target. These findings do not hold for business method patents, which do not appear to confer a survival advantage.""--abstract.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An unflinching analysis of a failure in business ethics, Shell Shock raised complex and timely questions: At what point did protection of the company's image usurp shareholder interests?  How did financial industry safeguards let such a crisis develop?  And how can similar fiascoes be prevented in the future?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And yet, as Marcus Buckingham astutely points out, even though the strengths-based approach is now conventional wisdom, the tools and systems inside organizations-performance appraisals, training programs, and succession planning systems-remain stubbornly remedial, exclusively focused on measuring skills, finding gaps, and attempting to plug them. It's a crisis for individuals and organizations, with management ideas and management practice utterly out of sync. That's about to change. StandOut 2.0 is a revolutionary book and tool that enables you to identify your strengths, and those of your team, and to act on them. The original StandOut provided top-notch management insights from one of the world's foremost authorities on strengths, as well as access to a powerful, cutting edge online assessment tool. Now, in addition to a much more powerful assessment, and a robust report on your most dominant strengths, StandOut 2.0 provides: - A StandOut profile, easily customized and exported, that you can use to present the very best of yourself to your team, and your company - Your own Personalized Strengths Channel, which, after taking the 15 minute assessment, will send you a weekly tip, insight, or technique, to help you do your best work this week - For team leaders, the ability to create a team dashboard including each member's StandOut profile, to help you make the right moves - Access to an entire strengths-based performance management system, including a check-in tool to capture priorities and track engagement; a survey tool to help you gauge what your team is thinking and feeling; and an evaluation tool to help reveal real-time performance levels of every single team member StandOut 2.0 is your indispensable guide and tool for building on your strengths to further your career, and to help your team and organization win""--   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Senior executives often go to great lengths to resist change.  When things start to go awry, they try harder (through efficiency gains, etc) and therefore may simply be getting better at doing the wrong thing.  Instead they need to analyse their market effectively and diagnose what is needed to respond to the real threats outside.  The illustrations throughout the book give the reader real-life tales of competition on the edge and show what took place behind the public narrative of many prominent companies.This book will prompt executives to ask: What is your Strategic IQ? Do you have the strategic intelligence to keep ahead of your competitors?  Readers will find the book enlightening and its lessons easy to apply: It provides a framework for understanding strategic intelligence A roadmap for advancing up the intelligence ladder Assessment tools to measure progress John Wells shows how traditional success metrics such as revenue growth, profit, market share, reputation and stock price often fail to predict impending disaster - and what to do about it""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Guns to Guatemala. For the men and women of Shorn Associates, opportunity is calling. In the superheated global village of the near future, big money is made by finding the right little war and supporting one side against the other--in exchange for a share of the spoils. To succeed, Shorn uses a new kind of corporate gladiator: sharp-suited, hard-driving gunslingers who operate armored vehicles and follow a Samurai code. And Chris Faulkner is just the man for the job.He fought his way out of London's zone of destitution. And his kills are making him famous. But unlike his best friend and competitor at Shorn, Faulkner has a side that outsiders cannot see: the side his wife is trying to salvage, that another woman--a porn star turned TV news reporter--is trying to exploit. Steeped in blood, eyed by common criminals looking for a shot at fame, Faulkner is living on borrowed time. Until he's given one last shot at getting out alive. . . .From the Trade Paperback edition.   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

Although it often feels as though either our biology or our personality (or both) guides our decisions about issues large and small, increasing evidence suggests that ... culture trumps everything. This book investigates the powerful ways in which a variety of factors, to include behavioral norms, alternative corporate models, habit patterns, connectedness, trust, language, and time perspective, impact the creation of ""quintessence"" in organizations. It is this quintessence -- or lack thereof -- that ultimately determines the success and sustainability of organizations. As leaders, we get the organizations we deserve, as a direct result of the cultures we nourish (or neglect). If we want to ensure the best possible outcomes for ourselves and our organizations, we must focus on developing the cultures that foster success for all stakeholders, because ... culture trumps everything   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sharing creativity principles and practices at the leading edge, The Book of Doing and Being offers a life-altering map for stepping beyond what we already know and into a dimension of imagination from which innovation is born.  Known for his inspiring movies and documentaries, as well as his popular creativity workshops, Barnet Bain makes available his teachings for the first time in book form. Discover how will and action come together with imagination and feeling to form the very foundation of creativity by working with this treasury of more than forty transformative exercises. Each one is designed to spark new creative connections by challenging our usual ways of thinking, feeling, and perceiving.  These lessons, tools, and techniques serve to unlock great reservoirs of creativity in every individual, whether it's jumpstarting or completing a project, launching a new business, creating a work of art, experiencing more fulfilling relationships, or making other dreams come true. Bain's motivational guidance includes: rewiring your brain to unleash ultra-creativity; finding freedom from self-criticism, perfectionism, and other obstructions to productivity and creative expression; harnessing the two forces of creativity: inspiration and action; discovering your emotions as the doorway to creative aliveness and ingenuity; and heeding the call of your Real Work, regardless of age, education, or experience.  Step by step, you will make the discovery of a lifetime: how to stop being ruled by your past and start consciously creating your present and future. You will be surprised and energized--by your next creative impulse, the next idea that excites you, the next experience that moves you--and you will live a creative life""--  ""How to unlock your most creative self""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But there is a pattern to who succeeds and who doesn't. And engaging in the consistent practice of its pursuit is the best way forward.  Based on the breakthrough Akimbo workshop pioneered by legendary author Seth Godin, The Practice will help you get unstuck and find the courage to make and share creative work. Godin insists that writer's block is a myth, that consistency is far more important than authenticity, and that experiencing the imposter syndrome is a sign that you're a well-adjusted human. Most of all, he shows you what it takes to turn your passion from a private distraction to a productive contribution, the one you've been seeking to share all along.  With this book as your guide, you'll learn to dance with your fear. To take the risks worth taking. And to embrace the empathy required to make work that contributes with authenticity and joy.

Conquering Complexity in Your Business,Michael L George,success_in_business,First published in 2004,/works/OL15189284W?edition=ia%3Aconqueringcomple0000geor,/authors/OL6819739A/Michael_L_George,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24321466M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  McGraw-Hill|Language English,"Here's a guarantee: Somewhere in your business, there is too much complexity. It erodes profitability, impedes productivity, confuses customers, and adds non-recoverable costs that can kill you in the marketplace. But that's only half the equation: You may also be losing out by having too little of the complexity where it counts--in the products, services, and options you offer to customers. Customers call this value-added complexity ""variety"", ""options"", or ""customization"". Either way, as you'll discover in Conquering Complexity in Your Business, the impact of complexity is enormous in terms of lost profit and missed growth opportunities.In this breakthrough book from Michael L. George and Stephen Wilson, you'll find out why the trick to outperforming your competition and staying ahead of the curve in today's highly customer-centric business environment is achieving the optimum levels of complexity in your products, services, and operations. Best of all, for the first time in print, you'll find powerful tools that will let you quantify and pinpoint complexity in your business. You'll also find strategies for conquering that complexity and dramatically increasing productivity, profits and market share.Conquering Complexity in Your Business is packed with real-world practical advice and guidance from both a strategic and tactical perspective. With the help of fascinating and instructive in-depth case studies from Dell, Capital One, Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Toyota, Scania, Lockheed Martin, Aldi, and other companies that have conquered complexity to become world leaders in their industries, the authors show you how to:Strategically identify the offering and process complexity in your businessQuantify the impact of that complexityDecide which complexity you want to keep to drive growth and which to eliminate to cut costsSelect and implement specific operational approaches to eliminate different kinds of complexitySustain an environment with just the right balance of complexity your company needs to maximize productivity and profitsDon't let complexity impose a ceiling on your profits and growth. Read Conquering Complexity in Your Business and learn how to serve your customers more effectively, dominate your competition, and delight your shareholders.""This is an important book that should be read by every CEO. Conquering Complexity is not just about reducing costs; it's fundamentally about growing revenues and creating economic value by serving your customers more effectively.""-Lou Giuliano, Chairman, President and CEO, ITT Industries""Complexity creeps into organizations incrementally, and each additional decision is, by itself, almost always justifiable. But faced with a crisis, many companies, including American Airlines, have chosen a head-on approach to removing complexity--we simply could not afford to do otherwise.""-Gerard J. Arpey, President and CEO, AMR Corporation and American Airlines""As we tackle the most resistant issues in the company, it is clear that complexity is a key causal. The challenge is getting our arms around the cost of complexity. Being able to size the opportunity creates a compelling call to action.""-Anne M. Mulcahy, Chairman and CEO, Xerox Corporation""It is critical that the authors' study and analysis gets outs to a wider audience to explain how complexity occurs and more importantly, how to both attack it and prevent it.""-Chris Cool, Vice President, Northrup-Grumman Corporation   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Timely and insightful, Risk/Reward is a unique blend of original research and practical wisdom that even the most risk-averse person can harness to realize success""--  ""We entertain ourselves with modest risk-- the scary movie, the party full of strangers, the weekend in Vegas. But when it comes to our careers, when self-identity and security hang in the balance, most of us don't like to play the odds very aggressively. While some of us are natural born thrill seekers, the majority of us are hardwired to avoid risk. But, Anne Kreamer argues, in the current workplace, that very avoidance could be putting us in a far more precarious position than we know. Consider these startling facts: The average job lasts 4 years-- or less. If you are in your 20s... you will have 11 jobs over the course of your working life. If you are in your 40s... you will have to change careers 2 more times. If you are in your 60s... you will likely have to work for another 10-20 years. Kreamer makes a compelling case that we all need to think and act more like entrepreneurs on our own behalf and become practitioners of the art of risk. Through proprietary research and her own keen record as a trend spotter, Kreamer convinces us of the necessity to embrace risk as a healthy and forward-thinking attribute and a way to improve the quality and longevity of our working lives""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Bernard Schwartz has dined with world leaders, cut a multi billion-dollar deal on the back of a napkin, and led a Fortune 200 corporation. From humble beginnings that saw his family moving regularly from apartment to apartment to take advantage of new lease discounts to his dramatic rise to CEO of a major aerospace innovator, the author's story is a narrative on the importance of character, intelligence, and a lot of good luck. In a time when stories about corrupt CEOs and unethical banking practices flood the news, Schwartz offers the notion that doing the right thing is a more rewarding road to accomplishment, and that when applied for immoral purposes even the sharpest skills will likely lead to a fall. As Americans today await the return of economic stability and politicians wage battle over the future of government programs, opportunity seems out of reach. But Schwartz, who grew up in Depression-era Brooklyn, believes that there are steps we can take as a nation to bring about a recovery and even growth. As a child, he watched men dress for work each day whether they held a job or not. He remembers the widespread deprivation that filled everyday scenes and the streets with breadlines. But he also recalls a hopeful people; a citizenry united in the pursuit of education, homeownership, proprietorship, and community improvement. Today, he champions investments in job creation, infrastructure, technology, and innovation as the means to get us back on track. With measured insight on the role the federal government can play in creating pathways to prosperity, the author discusses how the United States can again be a land of opportunity for all. In this inspiring example of a life well lived, Bernard Schwartz invites readers to look at their own opportunities, their own ideas, and even their fellow Americans and Just Say Yes.

""The Power of Pause"" process is a dynamic practice that Nance Guilmartin has taught thousands of people worldwide, equipping them to regain control of thoughts and avoid miscommunications. This tested method helps readers to take a moment to wonder what's called for when we feel we're short on time, attention, temper, or choices. In that instant, we can use a simple method to rewire our overloaded circuits, tap into our ""missing-in-action"" common sense, and raise our communication intelligence. This process is ""not"" about slowing down the pace of workday life. It is about enabling anyone who is time-pressed to make savvier choices and avoid costly mistakes. Shows how to exercise leadership skills that save time and strengthen relationships Offers a process for learning to engage in productive exchanges rather than attacking or being resigned Enables managers and teams to save time and money Reveals how to fix problems and achieve goals with less stress .

Christensen gave a powerful speech to the Harvard Business School's graduating class. Drawing upon his business research, he offered a series of guidelines for finding meaning and happiness in life. He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness. The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father's life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question ""How do you measure your life?"" became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students. In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I'll find satisfaction in my career? How can I be sure that my personal relationships become enduring sources of happiness? How can I avoid compromising my integrity--and stay out of jail? Using lessons from some of the world's greatest businesses, he provides incredible insights into these challenging questions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book argues that there are four key sources of competitive advantage and financial success that have not been given the attention they deserve. Firstly, that organizational design and management processes may be strategic resources in their own right. Secondly, that organizational design and management processes can be deployed to create new strategic resources. Thirdly, that managers have begun to think of organizational design and management processes in a proactive way rather than seeing them more passively as necessary facilitators of success. Fourthly, that this new way of looking at organization and management requires a search for new ways of structuring organizational design and managerial processes. These points are driven home through case studies of the Danish firms LEGO Group, Vestas Wind Systems, Coloplast, Chr. Hansen, IC Companys and NKT Flexibles""--  ""The dominant thinking in strategic management stresses the importance of assets, such as reputation, intellectual property rights, and relations with suppliers and customers. Less attention has been dedicated to organizational design and new management processes. However, the above discussion highlights the fact that such designs and processes can serve as strategic resources for firms. In other words, if they are properly organized and deployed, such resources can contribute decisively to corporate success. Thus, they contribute to the value the company can create and the value it can appropriate. They also help to make sure that the focal firm's level of appropriated value is higher than that of the competition. As mentioned above, management academics have only recently begun to put their academic talents to use in the analysis of management innovation. Therefore, the ways in which management innovations and improvements in organization and management processes can contribute to competitive advantage are far from fully understood""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Lovability genuine, heartfelt devotion and loyalty from customers is what propels a select few companies ahead, leading to consistent growth and profitability. Think about the companies that you really care about and how they make you feel. Love is central to all human interactions, and business is made up of human interactions. Do the math and the solution is clear: love is central to business. Nobody talks about it, but it is obvious in hindsight that love is everything in all we work for and can even be measured. This book shares what Silicon Valley-based author and CEO Brian de Haaff knows from a career of founding successful technology companies and building award-winning products. He reveals the secret to his own company's growth and the engine behind customer love; a set of principles that he pioneered and named The Responsive Method. In preparation for writing this book, he interviewed innovators at dozens of name brand and out-in-front organisations to help readers discover how to build their own lovable products and be happy doing it. Much has been written about how to build a breakthrough product and successful business, but the author's message is original and refreshing. In a business world that has increasingly emphaised hype over substance and unicorns over profitable growth, it's time for a new recipe for business success.

Now Robert is back and is here to debunk theever pervasive myths around the trail-blazing rebeloutsider...As Robert says himself, the fashionable commentators are extremely keen to cry 'Be a rebel outsider and the modernworld will fall at your feet: your talent celebrated, your ideasworshiped'. If only it were true. In reality outsiders are usually disabled by feelings of alienation and disaffection, and bytheir inability to fit-in within a world made by insiders. Far from being celebrated, the vast majority of outsiders are potentially chained to a life of low-attainment, mental-isolation, frustration, bitterness and surrender.   If you feel this way, all is not lost. The Outside Edge isall about learning to harness the unique vantage point you possessin order to give yourself the edge required to succeed. It will show you when to embrace your outsider status and go against convention, and when to play the game, do as the insiders do andmake sure you can get progress. Think of The Outside Edge as the life manual that will help you not only overcome negative feelings of exclusion but turn those into your USP - your edge.

A household name for his role in the founding of ubiquitous computer software company Microsoft, Bill Gates is one of the world's great businessmen. Brought up to compete rigorously in all areas of his life, he dropped out of Harvard in 1975 to follow his dream of starting his own firm with friend Paul Allen. Together, they formed 'Micro-Soft', and set about coding their way to the top. But developing software language was just the beginning of a journey that, for Gates, would eventually see him become the wealthiest man in the world. Initially only writing programs for other businesses such as IBM, in 1985 Microsoft launched their first version of Windows, the operating system that has dominated personal computing ever since. His hands-on attitude saw him constantly pick holes in executives' strategies until he was convinced they were watertight, an indomitable attitude that cemented Microsoft's place as the world's leading personal computer software company. How to Think Like Bill Gates reveals the key motivations, decisions and philosophies that made Gates a name synonymous with success. Studying how he honed his business acumen, how he faced down all competitors, overcame adversity and stood strong in the face of overwhelming odds, with quotes and passages by and about the man, you too can learn to think like Bill Gates.""--Amazon website.

Why are there snowblowers in Miami?,Steven D. Goldstein,success_in_business,First published in 2016,/works/OL20040031W,/authors/OL7610882A/Steven_D._Goldstein,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 188,"As a senior executive for a major department store chain, Steve Goldstein was shocked to find snowblowers for sale at the company's Miami store. When Goldstein asked a salesman on the floor how long this had been going on, he replied, ''I've been here for thirty years, and we've been getting them since I've been here.'' For Goldstein, this one snowblower experience crystallizes all the dysfunction he has seen in business over the course of his career. Whether it's having snowblowers for sale in a place where it never snows or a more pervasive issue--like having so many meetings scheduled there's no time left to actually solve any problems--dysfunction within large organizations is so prevalent that most people either accept it as an inevitable fact of corporate life or assume someone else will deal with it. But must it be this way? Goldstein's answer to this is a resounding No! In Why Are There Snowblowers in Miami?, he explains the nature of dysfunction present in most companies and other organizations, why it occurs, and most importantly, what leaders, at all levels, can do to tackle these issues and improve performance. A seasoned business leader with more than three decades of experience, he has discovered that almost all dysfunction is caused by a lack of engagement, and that it is fixable. Goldstein outlines his unique Five Principles of Engagement and demonstrates how top-level leaders can--and should--use them to improve the way they interact with their teams, employees, and customers. He offers pragmatic, proven techniques for solving problems most leaders face: including a revolutionary time-saving meeting model; a new process for making more efficient decisions--with all participants having greater accountability; a new system that impels leaders to really know their employees and customers; and other ground-breaking tools. Inspiring, entertaining and refreshingly honest, Why Are There Snowblowers in Miami? is filled with true stories from the author's own experience as well as anecdotes and insights culled from interviews he has conducted with some of the world's most influential CEOs. From these real-life examples readers will learn how understanding and utilizing the Five Principles of Engagement can lead to powerful and positive change in their own organizations--and in their lives.

We're our own worst critics, and if it looks like we're not going to do something right, we prefer not to do it at all. That's why we're most likely to quit on day two, ""the day after perfect""--when our results almost always underperform our aspirations. The strategies in this book are counterintuitive and might feel like cheating. But they're based on studies conducted by a university researcher with hundreds of participants. You might not guess that having more fun, eliminating your secret rules, and choosing something to bomb intentionally works. But the data says otherwise.

Welcome to the idea of functional stupidity. Functional stupidity can be catastrophic. It can cause organizational collapse, financial meltdown and technical disaster. And there are countless, more everyday examples of organizations accepting the dubious, the absurd and the downright idiotic, from unsustainable management fads to the cult of leadership or an over-reliance on brand and image. And yet a dose of stupidity can be useful and produce good, short-term results: it can nurture harmony, encourage people to get on with the job and drive success. This is the stupidity paradox. The Stupidity Paradox tackles head-on the pros and cons of functional stupidity. You'll discover what makes a workplace mindless, why being stupid might be a good thing in the short term but a disaster in the longer term, and how to make your workplace a little less stupid by challenging thoughtless conformity. It shows how harmony and action in the workplace can be balanced with a culture of questioning and challenge. The book is a wake-up call for smart organizations and smarter people. It encourages us to use our intelligence fully for the sake of personal satisfaction, organizational success and the flourishing of society as a whole. --Amazon.com.

According to bestselling author Alan Weiss, success is a combination of opportunism, very disciplined work, luck, timing, and ignoring most advice. In other words, it means striking out on your own, original path to success. In Million Dollar Maverick, he explains that entrepreneurs don't take advice, they create value and then monetize it. They do what they love and are great at and find a way to sell it to people. They do not-contrary to ""conventional wisdom""--Chase money. They attract money. And most of all they think differently, act decisively-and, if talent and timing are with them, succeed quickly.

But internal ""know-how"" that is unique to a specific company -- how to introduce a new drug into the diabetes market, how to decrease assembly time in an automobile plant -- is the stuff of which sustained competitive advantage is made. Dr. Dixon was one of the early thought leaders in the Knowledge Management field with her book, Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive By Sharing What They Know, Harvard Business School Press, 2000. That book was based on a research study of how fifteen of the most successful companies were leveraging their knowledge. Her work was seminal in developing the early theory that demonstrated that different transfer processes were needed for the sharing of tacit knowledge vs. explicit knowledge. She has continued to advance the leading edge of understanding about the expanding role that knowledge plays in organizations. - Publisher.

The model has been supported by management excellence, the relentless pursuit of improvement and a constant flow of ideas and input from customers. In recent years Dell has maintained its market-leading position by positioning itself at the heart of the Internet revolution. 70% of Dell's orders happen on-line and 50% of all sales are web-enabled. Dell's own infrastructure products are driving e-business around the world."" ""Business the Dell Way reveals how any manager, entrepreneur or investor can learn from the Dell story.

He was about to stand in front of the employees of the Happy Face Toy Company's faltering Cleveland factory. As the new CEO, he'd been advised to close this factory as soon as possible, but he wanted to see it first. ""How hard could this be?"" he wondered, gathering the courage to ask them about their jobs. He had no idea what he was in for. When was the last time you told your colleagues how much you value them? It sounds like a trivial thing in the middle of a busy work day. But as David Novak discovered during his years as a hard charging executive, there's nothing trivial about recognition. It can make a life-or-death difference to any organization, when people see that someone important really notices and appreciates their contributions. Rather than explain the power of recognition in a typical business book, Novak decided to write a fun story that draws on his real-world experiences at Pepsi and Yum! Brands, as well as his personal life. The story opens when Jeff Johnson becomes the third-generation CEO of his family business, after the sudden death of his father. The Happy Face Toy Company had many hits in the 1950s and 60s, including Crazy Paste, but its results have been declining for more than a decade. The board has given Jeff just one year to turn the business around, or else they'll have to sell it to the highest bidder. As Jeff races to save his family's legacy by getting the company back on track, he meets downtrodden factory workers and an uninspired executive team. Then a birthday gift from his own grandson gives Jeff an important insight into why Happy Face lost its old culture of innovation and excitement, along with its profitability. Jeff comes up with an idea that seems crazy.  ""Jeff took a deep breath to calm down. He was about to stand in front of the employees of the Happy Face Toy Company's faltering Cleveland factory.

Along the way, Riley earned the respect and trust of political leaders and powerful entrepreneurs, as well as factory workers and fellow executives.  His remarkable and quintessentially optimistic tale of American business success rebuts the belief that it's impossible, or nearly so, to reach great heights from humble beginnings.""--Back cover.

When Chambers joined Cisco in 1991, it was a company with 400 employees, a single product, and about $70 million in revenue. When he stepped down as CEO in 2015, he left a $47 billion tech giant that was the backbone of the internet and a leader in areas from cybersecurity to data center convergence. Along the way, he had acquired 180 companies and turned more than 10,000 employees into millionaires. Widely recognized as an innovator, an industry leader, and one of the world's best CEOs, Chambers has outlasted and outmaneuvered practically every rival that ever tried to take Cisco on--Nortel, Lucent, Alcatel, IBM, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard, to name a few. Now Chambers is sharing his unique strategies for winning in a digital world. From his early lessons and struggles with dyslexia in West Virginia to his bold bets and battles with some of the biggest names in tech, Chambers gives readers a playbook on how to act before the market shifts, tap customers for strategy, partner for growth, build teams, and disrupt themselves. He also adapted those lessons to transform government, helping global leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create new models for growth. As CEO of JC2 Ventures, he's now investing in a new generation of game-changing startups by helping founders become great leaders and scale their companies. Connecting the Dots is destined to become a business classic, providing hard-won insights and critical tools to thrive during the accelerating disruption of the digital age.

The only person who can create a life you'll love is you. Our grandmothers fought for the right to work. Our mothers fought for the choice to be in an office or to stay at home. Our generation is the first to fully embrace and celebrate the fact that our lives are multidimensional. Thanks to the women who come before us and paved the way, we can create the lives we want to lead -- which look different for each of us. I've been fortunate to be able to build my career around my passions, from real estate to fashion. But my professional titles only begin to describe who I am and what I value. I have been an executive and an entrepreneur, but also -- and just as importantly -- a wife, mother, daughter, and friend. To me, 'work' encompasses my efforts to succeed in all of these areas. After appearing on The Apprentice years ago and receiving a flood of letters from young women asking for guidance, l realized the need tor more female leaders to speak out publicly in order to change the way society thinks and talks about ""women who work."" So I created a forum to do just that. This book evolves the conversation that started on IvankaTrump.com, where so many incredible women (and men!) have shared their experiences, advice, ambitions, and passions. Women who work lead meetings and train tor marathons. We learn how to cook and how to code. We inspire our employees and our children. We innovate at our current jobs and start new businesses. Women Who Work will equip you with the best skills I've learned from some of the amazing people I've met, on subjects such as identifying opportunities, shifting careers smoothly, negotiating, leading teams, starting companies, managing work and family, and helping change the system to make it better for women -- now and in the future. I hope it will inspire you to redefine success and architect a life that honors your individual passions and priorities, in a way only you can. - Jacket.

How can we explain their dramatic economic ascent? Have Jews been successful because of cultural factors distinct to them as a group, or because of the particular circumstances that they encountered in America? This book argues that the Jews who flocked to the United States during the age of mass migration were aided appreciably by their association with a particular corner of the American economy: the rag trade. From humble beginnings, Jews rode the coattails of the clothing trade from the margins of economic life to a position of unusual promise and prominence, shaping both their societal status and the clothing industry as a whole. Comparing the history of Jewish participation within the clothing trade in the United States with that of Jews in the same business in England, this book demonstrates that differences within the garment industry on either side of the Atlantic contributed to a very real divergence in social and economic outcomes for Jews in each setting.

Random gifts of art,Garret Garrels,success_in_business,First published in 2014,/works/OL28772962W?edition=ia%3Arandomgiftsofart0000garr,/authors/OL7754830A/Garret_Garrels,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL39489686M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Loops Publications|Language English|Pages 167,"What started as a personal connection project of a noted artist and an international speaker, handing out original drawings to random strangers morphed into a social creativity project spanning the world. A gift derived from one's excess seems trivial only to oneself. But an element that one minimizes in one's own life can be transformed into a valued richness by another simply recognizing it as such. We can build a kind of social glue on generosity, with a tiny stroke of imagination applied in just the right place. Two people share their problems and find a common solution that opens up the world in new ways for both of them. Giving away art, connecting with strangers, enlivening rather than killing time, the world is transformed. Find out more of the story at: RandomGiftsofArt.com.

It's the one thing all successful people have in common. People who achieve their dreams understand the critical relationship between their level of thinking and their level of progress, and they know that when thinking is limited, so is potential. Now, John C. Maxwell explores the idea and identifies the specific skills people need to make their potential for success explode into reality. From focused and creative thinking to thinking for the big picture and the bottom line, he provides examples of effective thinking for every situation.

These invisible barriers, which Elsesser labels the ""sex partition,"" tend to have the greatest impact on the careers of women, because men typically still dominate senior management, and connections with senior managers are essential for career advancement. Elsesser describes how senior male employees prefer to stick with other men, especially when it comes to dinners, drinks, late-night meetings, or business trips. When it's time for promotions or pay raises, these same executives are more likely to show preference to the employees with whom they feel most comfortable--other men. Elsesser doesn't blame men for the sex partition; instead, she describes how some common organizational practices create barriers between the sexes. She offers practical advice on how to break down the sex partition and reveals the best strategies for networking with the opposite sex. Sex and the Office is sure to spark new dialogue on the sources of the gender gap at work. ""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Oklahoma city of Tulsa in 1921 had a Black hospital, a Black public library, 2 Black public schools, 2 Black newspapers, 2 Black theatres, 5 hotels, 13 churches, 30 restaurants and perhaps 600 Black businesses! What was the story of this great Black achievement? What happened to all of this? In the first half of this book, Robin Walker addresses these questions. What does it take for an individual to replicate the kind of economic success that the people of Black Wall Street achieved? In the second part of this book, Robin Walker presents his own ideas on what it takes to become successful. He outlines The Seven Key Empowerment Principles that any individual needs to use as a minimum to replicate that kind of success. He shows that individuals need five things to make it in the money game. They need Inspiration, Correct Knowledge, a Money Management System, a Personal Plan, and the Seven Key Empowerment Principles. Inspiration gives individuals ‘the WHY.’ Correct Knowledge gives individuals ‘the TARGET.’ A Money Management System and the Personal Plan gives people ‘the HOW.’ Finally, The Seven Key Empowerment Principles is ‘the CEMENT’ that holds ‘the WHY,’ ‘the HOW’ and ‘the TARGET’ together."" -- Amazon.com.

Today he is the chairman and chief executive officer of the largest supplier of men's fine-tailored clothing in North America, and is considered an outstanding business and community leader, at the forefront of policy-making in Canada's apparel industry, with commitments to philanthropic efforts that echo his business accomplishments. In My Peerless Story, Segal recounts how he learned business from the collar down and from the ground up, transforming a family-owned business into one that would eventually come to license labels such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Michael Kors. Sharing anecdotes and personal experiences, Segal describes the history of garment manufacturing in Montreal and his intuitive strategies to leverage growth by improving fabrics, and adapting to innovative changes in the industry, eventually becoming the main inventory source of designer label suits to major department stores.

We work hard, follow the rules, and dream of a better life. But these days, working harder doesn't always lead to fulfillment. In fact, according to Gallup research, nearly 90 percent of people feel disconnected from their jobs. So how do you break free from the drudgery and achieve more success on your own terms? You hustle. The secret lies in making manageable tweaks and placing small bets on pursuits that propel you from who you are today to the person you're destined to become. Neil Patel, Patrick Vlaskovits, and Jonas Koffler -- entrepreneurs and consultants -- have teamed up to teach you how to look at work and life through a new lens -- one based on discovering projects you enjoy and the people and opportunities that support your talents, growth, income, and happiness. The authors reveal their three-part framework of Heart, Head, and Habits. Along the way, you will learn to redefine hustle as the optimal path to success using powerful, often counterintuitive, advice, including: Why you must own your dreams, not rent dreams from others; ways to create your own luck and ""POP;"" how to betray yourself to stay true to yourself and develop your potential; the four major career hustles and the path that's best for you.

Childers carefully interweaves fiction with real-world places, events, and politics, making for an extremely convincing story of invasion—so convincing that some (perhaps erroneously) credit the novel with spurring the creation of new English naval bases. The framing device, where Childers pretends to be an editor presenting a factual account, only adds to the believability of the story. The novel begins with Carruthers, an official in the Foreign Office, accepting an invitation from his friend Davies for what he assumes is a pleasure trip on a sailboat in the Baltic sea. As the two embark on their journey, it quickly becomes apparent that not everything is at it seems on the German coast. Riddle helped energize the spy novel genre, providing a template for countless authors to come, including Ian Fleming and John le Carré, and has been adapted numerous times for film, television and radio.

A codicil to his will, however, left Orley Farm (near London) to his much younger second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, and there were three witnesses, one of whom was no longer alive. A bitterly fought court case confirmed the codicil.  Twenty years pass. Lady Mason lives at Orley farm with her adult son, Lucius. Samuel Dockwrath, a tenant, is asked to leave by Lucius, who wants to try new intensive farming methods. Aggrieved, and knowing of the original case (John Kenneby, one of the codicil witnesses, had been an unsuccessful suitor of his wife Miriam Usbech), Dockwrath investigates and finds a second deed signed by the same witnesses on the same date, though they can remember signing only one. He travels to Groby Park in Yorkshire, where Joseph Mason the younger lives with his comically parsimonious wife, and persuades Mason to have Lady Mason prosecuted for forgery. The prosecution fails, but Lady Mason later confesses privately that she committed the forgery, and is prompted by conscience to give up the estate.  There are various subplots. The main one deals with a slowly unfolding romance between Felix Graham (a young and relatively poor barrister without family) and Madeline Staveley, daughter of Judge Stavely of Noningsby. Graham has a long-standing engagement to the penniless Mary Snow, whom he supports and educates while she is being “moulded” to be his wife.  Between the Staveleys at Alston and Orley Farm at Hamworth lies the Cleve, where Sir Peregrine Orme lives with his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Orme, and grandson, Peregrine. Sir Peregrine falls in love with Lady Mason and is briefly engaged to her, but she calls off the match when she realises the seriousness of the court case.  Meanwhile, Mr. Furnival, another barrister, befriends Lady Mason, arousing the jealousy of his wife. His daughter, Sophia, has a brief relationship with Augustus Stavely and a brief engagement to Lucius Mason. Eventually Furnival and his wife are reconciled, and Sophia's engagement is dropped. Sophia is portrayed as an intelligent woman who writes comically skillful letters.   Read more Read less",8 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

When that past reaches out for her in a particularly horrifying fashion, he vows revenge and, assembling all of his old skills, sets out to track down the men responsible, before it can happen again.  At the same time, the Pentagon is readying an operation to rescue a key group of prisoners in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp.

Attempting to juggle the two, Kelly (now code-named Mr. Clark) finds himself confronted by a vast array of enemies, both at home and abroad - men so skillful that the slightest misstep means death. And the fate of dozens of people, including Kelly himself, rests on his making sure that misstep never happens.  Men aren't born dangerous. They grow dangerous. And the most dangerous of all, Kelly learns, are the ones you least expect...

Expensively trained by the SAS, he now works for British Intelligence as a deniable operative, and he needs a regular income to take care of his responsibilities, which include psychiatric care for a traumatised orphan. He takes a lucrative mercenary job kidnapping a leading Chechen Mafioso; when the job goes sour, his victim is impressed by his grace under pressure and hires him to baby-sit a computer espionage expert on a jaunt into Finland. Not all is as it seems--Nick was engaged in wishful thinking to believe it was--and he finds himself adrift with little money and no weapons in Estonia in the dead of winter with a friend to rescue, the interests of the West to retrieve and, if possible, money to earn... This is an effective thriller because of the clash between its hero's competence and his less than entire brightness--Nick gets himself into messes and then gets out of them because of skills in combat, disguise and survival.

Rainbow Six, however, goes beyond anything he has done before.  At its heart is John Clark, the ex-Navy SEAL of Without Remorse and well-known from several of Clancy's novels as ""the dark side of Jack Ryan,"" the man who conducts the secret operational missions Ryan can have no part of. Whether hunting warlords in Japan, druglords in Colombia, or nuclear terrorists in the United States, Clark is efficient and deadly, but even he has ghosts in his past, demons that must be exorcised. And nothing is more demonic than the peril he must face in Rainbow Six: a group of terrorists like none the world has ever encountered before, a band of men and women so extreme that their success could literally mean the end of life on this earth as we know it.  It is Tom Clancy's most shocking story ever-and closer to reality than any government would care to admit. As Clancy takes us through the twists and turns of Rainbow Six, he blends the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, knife-edge suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters.

But its beautiful gothic exterior hides a horrific past: it was the scene of a series of depraved killings that have never been solved. Neglected, empty, and rumored to be cursed, it's known as the Murder House, and locals keep their distance. Detective Jenna Murphy used to consider herself a local, but she hasn't been back since she was a girl. Trying to escape her troubled past and rehabilitate a career on the rocks, the former New York City cop hardly expects her lush and wealthy surroundings to be a hotbed of grisly depravity. But when a Hollywood power broker and his mistress are found dead in the abandoned Murder House, the gruesome crime scene rivals anything Jenna experienced in Manhattan. And what at first seems like an open and shut case turns out to have as many shocking secrets as the Murder House itself, as Jenna quickly realizes that the mansion's history is much darker than even the town's most salacious gossips could have imagined. As more bodies surface, and the secret that Jenna has tried desperately to escape closes in on her, she must risk her own life to expose the truth -- before the Murder House claims another victim.

Reviewers hail his boundless originality, his art, his unparalleled ability to create highly textured, riveting drama, at once viscerally familiar and utterly unique.  Author of one #1 New York Times bestseller after another, Koontz is at the pinnacle of his powers, spinning mysteries and miracles, enthralling tales that speak directly to today’s readers, balm for the heart and fire for the mind. In this stunning new novel, he delivers a tour de force of dark suspense and brilliant revelation that has all the Koontz trademarks: adventure, chills, riddles, humor, heartbreak, an unforgettable cast of characters, and a climax that will leave you clamoring for more.  Dylan O’Connor is a gifted young artist just trying to do the right thing in life. He’s on his way to an arts festival in Santa Fe when he stops to get a room for himself and his twenty-year-old autistic brother, Shep. But in a nightmarish instant, Dylan is attacked by a mysterious “doctor,” injected with a strange substance, and told that he is now a carrier of something that will either kill him...or transform his life in the most remarkable way. Then he is told that he must flee--before the doctor’s enemies hunt him down for the secret circulating through his body. No one can help him, the doctor says, not even the police.  Stunned, disbelieving, Dylan is turned loose to run for his life...and straight into an adventure that will turn the next twenty-four hours into an odyssey of terror, mystery--and wondrous discovery. It is a journey that begins when Dylan and Shep’s path intersects with that of Jillian Jackson. Before that evening Jilly was a beautiful comedian whose biggest worry was whether she would ever find a decent man. Now she too is a carrier. And even as Dylan tries to convince her that they’ll be safer sticking together, cold-eyed men in a threatening pack of black Suburbans approach, only seconds before Jilly’s classic Coupe DeVille explodes into thin air.  Now the three are on the run together, but with no idea whom they’re running from--or why. Meanwhile Shep has begun exhibiting increasingly disturbing behavior. And whatever it is that’s coursing through their bodies seems to have plunged them into one waking nightmare after another. Seized by sinister premonitions, they find themselves inexplicably drawn to crime scenes--just minutes before the crimes take place.  What this unfathomable power is, how they can use it to stop the evil erupting all around them, and why they have been chosen are only parts of a puzzle that reaches back into the tragic past and the dark secrets they all share: secrets of madness, pain, and untimely death. Perhaps the answer lies in the eerie, enigmatic messages that Shep, with precious time running out, begins to repeat, about an entity who does his work “by the light of the moon.”  By the Light of the Moon is a novel of heart-stopping suspense and transcendent beauty, of how evil can destroy us and love can redeem us--a masterwork of the imagination in which the surprises come page after page and the spell of sublime storytelling triumphs throughout.

The investigation quickly unearths dangerous truths.  The book was later reissued under Ludlum's proper name. Ludlum explained the reason for his use of a pseudonym by saying he ""had to publish Trevayne under another name. I chose Jonathan Ryder — the first name of one son, the second a contraction of my wife's maiden name — not because of potential retribution, but because the conventional wisdom of the time was that a novelist did not author more than a book a year.

The first time was on the gridiron. A big, towering athlete, he was the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and left him with an improbable side effect -- he can never forget anything. The second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective, Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare -- his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered. His family destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night, Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force, loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a private investigator when he can. But over a year later, a man turns himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.   Read more Read less",58 Want to read|6 Currently reading|20 Have read

No one ever paid for the horrific crime ... except, that is, the victim's loved ones, who suffer to this day.Brandon Walker, once the sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, no longer feels he has purpose. A reluctant retiree living in the long shadow of his wife, Diana Ladd, a successful author of true-crime books, he is bored with golf, and more so with life. Salvation, though, comes with an invitation to join the ranks of The Last Chance, an exclusive nationwide fraternity of former cops and forensic experts who look into unsolved murders that have baffled local law enforcement agencies. And one such case is staring Brandon in the face with cold, dead, entreating eyes -- a murder investigation that may have been mishandled by his department when he was a young lawman.The trail of a sadistic, calculating, and blood-chillinglyefficient killer soon leads Brandon into a strange world at the unlikely border between forensic science and tribal mysticism: a place where evil hides behind a perfect facade. Now the seeds of terror sown three decades earlier have bloomed and are bearing awful fruit. A forgotten homicide in the Arizona desert is only the beginning of the nightmare that is about to ensnare a diligent ex-cop and his family, for Brandon Walker is the only one still alive who can unravel a blood knot of terror and obsession that will free a dark truth more frightening than he ever imagined.A novel that bristles with electrifying intensity and is alive with the breathtaking atmosphere and rich characterizations that have become J.

When they finally decide to adopt, American agencies tell them they will have to wait years for their dream to come true. The couple agrees to fly to war-torn Colombia to adopt a baby girl. Paul knows all about risks. As an insurance executive, he routinely calculates the odds of dying in a plane crash or being hit by a bus.

When a casino robbery in Atlantic City goes horribly awry, the man who orchestrated it is obliged to call in a favor from someone who’s occasionally called Jack. While it’s doubtful that anyone knows his actual name or anything at all about his true identity, or even if he’s still alive, he’s in his mid-thirties and lives completely off the grid, a criminal’s criminal who does entirely as he pleases and is almost impossible to get in touch with. But within hours a private jet is flying this exceptionally experienced fixer and cleaner-upper from Seattle to New Jersey and right into a spectacular mess: one heister dead in the parking lot, another winged but on the run, the shooter a complete mystery, the $1.2 million in freshly printed bills god knows where and the FBI already waiting for Jack at the airport, to be joined shortly by other extremely interested and elusive parties. He has only forty-eight hours until the twice-stolen cash literally explodes, taking with it the wider, byzantine ambitions behind the theft. To contend with all this will require every gram of his skill, ingenuity and self-protective instincts, especially when offense and defense soon become meaningless terms. And as he maneuvers these exceedingly slippery slopes, he relives the botched bank robbery in Kuala Lumpur five years earlier that has now landed him this unwanted new assignment.  From its riveting opening pages, Ghostman effortlessly pulls the reader into Jack’s refined and peculiar world—and the sophisticated shadowboxing grows ever more intense as he moves, hour by hour, toward a  constantly reimprovised solution. With a quicksilver plot, gripping prose and masterly expertise, Roger Hobbs has given us a novel that will immediately place him in the company of our most esteemed crime writers.

Olivia has in her possession letters from her deceased cousin Catherine, a nun, now being considered for beatification by the Catholic Church—the final step before sainthood. In her lifetime, Sister Catherine had founded seven hospitals for disabled children. Now the cure of a four-year-old boy dying of brain cancer is being attributed to her. After his case was pronounced medically hopeless, the boy’s desperate mother had organized a prayer crusade to Sister Catherine, leading to his miraculous recovery.  The letters Olivia holds are the evidence that Catherine gave birth at age seventeen to a child, a son, and gave him up for adoption. Olivia knows the identity of the young man who fathered Catherine’s child: Alex Gannon, who went on to become a world-famous doctor, scientist, and inventor holding medical patents.  Now, two generations later, thirty-one-year-old pediatrician Dr. Monica Farrell, Catherine’s granddaughter, stands as the rightful heir to what remains of the family fortune. But in telling Monica who she really is, Olivia would have to betray Catherine’s wishes and reveal the story behind Monica’s ancestry.  The only people aware of Olivia’s impending choice are those exploiting the Gannon inheritance.

She is soon introduced to her ""charge,"" John Cosway, a thirty-nine-year-old man whose strange behavior is vaguely explained by his mother and sisters as part of the madness that runs in the family.

While competing in a fishing tournament in a remote area of northern Minnesota, he gets a call from Lucas Davenport to investigate a murder at a nearby resort, where a woman has been shot while kayaking. The resort is for women only, a place to relax, get fit, recover from plastic surgery, commune with nature, and while it didn't start out to be a place mostly for those with Sapphic inclinations, that's pretty much what it is today.Which makes things all the more complicated for Virgil, because as he begins investigating, he finds a web of connections between the people at the resort, the victim, and some local women, notably a talented country singer. The more he digs, the more he discovers the arrows of suspicion that point in many directions, encompassing a multitude of motivations: jealousy, blackmail, greed, anger, fear. Then he finds that this is not the first murder, that there was a second, seemingly unrelated one, the year before. And that there's about to be a third, definitely related one, any time now. And as for the fourth . . . well, Virgil better hope he can catch the killer before that happens. Because it could be his own.Rich with the brilliant plotting and compulsively readable prose that are his hallmarks, Rough Country is another immensely satisfying tale by one of our very best suspense writers.

Murder List,Julie Garwood,thriller,First published in 2004,/works/OL26957W?edition=ia%3Amurderlis00garw,/authors/OL26230A/Julie_Garwood,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23271249M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Ballantine Books|Language English|Pages 403,"There are few authors who can weave nail-biting thrills, edge-of-your-seat drama, and romantic suspense as masterfully as Julie Garwood. Now she ratchets up the tension with Murder List, in which evil is on the hunt-- and proves to be methodically organized and chillingly successful.When Chicago detective Alec Buchanan is offered a prime position with the FBI, it is the perfect opportunity to leave the Windy City and follow in his brothers' footsteps to the top echelons of law enforcement. But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo--and the victim is no stranger.Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar.At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little ""cleansing"" exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist? Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call--and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot.The experience is all but forgotten--until the first person on Regan's list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move--and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.From the Hardcover edition.

When she was sixteen years old, Angela Wong--one of the most popular girls in school--disappeared without a trace. Nobody ever suspected that her best friend, Georgina Shaw, now an executive and rising star at her Seattle pharmaceutical company, was involved in any way. Certainly not Kaiser Brody, who was close with both girls back in high school. But fourteen years later, Angela Wong's remains are discovered in the woods near Geo's childhood home. And Kaiser--now a detective with Seattle PD--finally learns the truth: Angela was a victim of Calvin James. The same Calvin James who murdered at least three other women. To the authorities, Calvin is a serial killer. But to Geo, he's something else entirely. Back in high school, Calvin was Geo's first love. Turbulent and often volatile, their relationship bordered on obsession from the moment they met right up until the night Angela was killed. For fourteen years, Geo knew what happened to Angela and told no one. For fourteen years, she carried the secret of Angela's death until Geo was arrested and sent to prison. While everyone thinks they finally know the truth, there are dark secrets buried deep. And what happened that fateful night is more complex and more chilling than anyone really knows. Now the obsessive past catches up with the deadly present when new bodies begin to turn up, killed in the exact same manner as Angela Wong.

The boy was dead, Max was sure of it. Three years had passed since Haitian billionaire Allain Carver's five-year-old son was abducted. Why bother now? The huge bounty and the resources of the most powerful white family in Haiti hadn't turned up a lead. Sure, Max had been the best detective in Miami once. But that was eight years back. Before he served time for killing a pair of junkie child-murderers. Before his wife, Sandra, died. Plus, he'd heard what had happened to the other PI's sent to Haiti before him—all dead, or their lives permanently screwed up, without ever getting close to finding Charlie Carver. But with nothing left to lose—and for all that money—Max does go down there. The talk of voodoo and black magic is nothing compared to the haunting quiet of his own empty house. What Max doesn't count on is the depth of corruption, manipulation, and greed Haiti breeds in its inhabitants, a murky evil worse than death, which can easily swallow a man whole—especially a troubled man like Max Mingus. When the trail to Charlie Carver points to a local myth—""Mr. Clarinet,"" a spirit figure who for decades is said to have been tempting children away from their families—could the truth be even more shocking than the legend?

Jackson Brodie, ex-army, ex-police, ex-private detective, is also an innocent bystander - until he becomes a suspect.

A few days later, another clip is sent to the police. There is no way of identifying the woman before she, too, falls victim to a brutal attack.

But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was--and its true nature could change the modern world.Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts--and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he'd left behind.It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton's former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who's far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she's not alone. Competing for the historic prize--and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses--is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command. Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world--and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees.From the Hardcover edition.

The wheel spins,Ethel Lina White,thriller,First published in 1936,/works/OL7581114W?edition=ia%3Awheelspinsnovel0000whit,/authors/OL2323155A/Ethel_Lina_White,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32153874M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  RosettaBooks|Language English,"Best known as the basis for Alfred HItchcock's classic film The Lady Vanishes, Ethel White's book The Wheel Spins is a gripping and accomplished work in its own right. The plot is deceptively simple and the premise is classic: a woman meets a mysterious stranger during a long railway journey. It's easy to see in this novel what Hitchcock found so compelling and so well-suited to his particular brand of filmmaking. The protagonist of the story is Iris Carr, who suffers a blackout just before boarding a train that is traveling across Europe to London. On board the train, the still-woozy Iris befriends a certain Mrs. Froy, a fellow Englishwoman who is perhaps a bit eccentric but seems to be for the most part agreeable and benign. Mrs. Froy is the ""vanishing lady"" of Hitchcock's title, and it is Mrs. Froy who mysteriously disappears while Iris is napping. Her inexplicable departure throws Iris into a mind-bending mystery that will make her alternately question her sanity and the designs of the people around her. When Iris asks about Mrs. Froy, everyone on board the train denies ever having seen the old woman. Although Iris could perhaps be swayed due to the knock on her head that Mrs. Froy was merely a vivid hallucination, a few stray details suggest that something more sinister is happening, and Iris resolves to get to the bottom of the mystery.s gripping as the plot is, the novel's true strength is the masterful way in which White builds a brooding and ominous atmosphere that hangs over even the most seemingly ordinary scenes. White has been compared to Edgar Allan Poe, although White also has much in common with Wilkie Collins, Patricia Highsmith, and Mary Higgins Clark. Unlike traditional mystery stories or whodunits which generally open with a crime, White's novels trade on our anticipation of a future transgression and the eventual explanation of unusual events.

Save for one thing: the Civil War never occurred. A gifted young Black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service. He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called ""the Hard Four."" On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right--with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child who may be Victor's salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all--though his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface. Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost. Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe""--   Read more Read less",15 Want to read|0 Currently reading|7 Have read

Among the teen counselors, tensions and hormones are running high. No wonder the others agree when Jo-Beth Chancellor suggests they scare Monica O'Neal a little--or a lot. Monica has it coming, and no one will really get hurt. What could go wrong? Twenty years later, Lucas Dalton, a senior detective with the sheriff's department, is investigating the discovery of human remains in a cavern at what used to be Camp Horseshoe. Lucas knows the spot well. His father, a preacher, ran the camp, and Lucas worked there that infamous summer when two girls went missing. One is believed to have been killed by a convict on the loose. Monica O'Neal is thought to have drowned and been washed out to sea. Lucas knows he should step down from such a personal case. He's already jeopardized his career by removing evidence of his involvement. But maybe it's time to uncover the whole truth at last. That's why five former female counselors are coming back to the small Oregon town -- among them, Bernadette Warden, the woman Lucas has never forgotten.

But while Libby has been going about her life without incident when she becomes an heiress everything changes: she also learns of the violence in her family’s past and has no choice but to try and figure out what happened to her parents.

P. Putnam's Sons|Language English|Pages 352","From ""one of crime fiction's most interesting and passionate voices"" (Laura Lippman) comes a new ""noir crime classic"" (Mystery Ink) about one of the most notorious towns in American history.  Reviewing White Shadow, the Associated Press wrote, ""It is as gritty as James Ellroy's L.A. Confidential. And yet, the prose is as lyrical as James Lee Burke's Crusader's Cross. With White Shadow, Atkins has found his true voice."" And with Wicked City, it is even truer.  In 1955, Look magazine called Phenix City, Alabama, ""The Wickedest City in America,"" but even that may have been an understatement. It was a stew of organized crime and corruption, run by a machine that dealt with complaints forcefully and with dispatch. No one dared cross them-no one even tried. And then the machine killed the wrong man.  When crime-fighting attorney Albert Patterson is gunned down in a Phenix City alley in the spring of 1954, the entire town seems to pause just for a moment- and when it starts up again, there is something different about it. A small group of men meet and decide that they have had enough, but what that means and where it will take them is something they could not have foreseen. Over the course of the next several months, lives will change, people will die, and unexpected heroes will emerge-like ""a Randolph Scott western,"" one of them remarks, ""played out not with horses and Winchesters but with Chevys and .38s and switchblades.""  Peopled by an extraordinary cast of characters, both real and fictional, Wicked City is a novel of uncommon intensity-rich with atmosphere and filled with sensuality and surprise.

But in order to justify personal gain at others' expense, the group decides to pick their victims based on people who have done harm to the black community in the past. A plan hatched in a dark pool hall could be a way to escape their drab lives and bring some equality back to the world.But when the group takes in Yakoob's shady neighbor Raul, their scheme takes a sinister twist. Now, with murder in the mix, and the possibility of serious consequences, their best-laid plans may spiral into much more dangerous territory....

A unique collaboration by two long-time friends and thriller aficionados, STATE OF TERROR will be published on October 12, 2021.  The story follows a novice Secretary of State who has joined the administration of her rival, a president inaugurated after four years of American leadership that shrank from the world stage. A series of terrorist attacks throws the global order into disarray, and the Secretary is tasked with assembling a team to unravel the deadly conspiracy, a scheme carefully designed to take advantage of an American government dangerously out of touch and out of power in the places where it counts the most.  This high-stakes thriller of international intrigue features behind-the-scenes global drama informed by details only an insider could know.  “When it was suggested my friend Hillary and I write a political thriller together, I could not say yes fast enough,” said Louise Penny. “What an incredible experience, to get inside the State Department. Inside the White House.  Inside the mind of the Secretary of State as high stake crises explode.  Before we started, we talked about her time as Secretary of State. What was her worst nightmare? STATE OF TERROR is the answer.”  Hillary Clinton added, “Writing a thriller with Louise is a dream come true. I’ve relished every one of her books and their characters as well as her friendship. Now we’re joining our experiences to explore the complex world of high stakes diplomacy and treachery. All is not as it first appears.”  In a joint statement, Jonathan Karp, President and Chief Executive Officer of Simon & Schuster, and Don Weisberg, Chief Executive Officer of Macmillan Trade Publishers, said, “When we read Louise Penny and Hillary Clinton’s outline for STATE OF TERROR, it was immediately clear that when an ingenious novelist goes to work with one of the world’s most knowledgeable leaders, the results are kinetic.

His mother, Shara Bey, who was an A-wing pilot for the Rebellion against the Empire, was more than happy to show her son everything she knew about flying. But she died an untimely death, and Poe was left alone with his father, Kes Dameron, who struggles with grief and a desire to keep his son safe.  Now sixteen, Poe wants nothing more than to leave his home on the quiet moon Yavin 4 to find adventure in the wider galaxy, while his father wants nothing more than for him to stay put. So when a group of smugglers offers Poe a job piloting them off-world, it feels like an opportunity he can't refuse. And by the time he finds out the smugglers are actually part of the fearsome criminal enterprise called the Spice Runners of Kijimi, Poe is already in deep. His burgeoning friendship—and perhaps more—with one young Spice Runner, Zorii, is even more incentive for Poe to stick around. But is this the life he's meant to have, is it even the life he wants?

He hopes to stage a sponsored performance of his newest play “A Midsummer Night's Dream”. He is short of actors and has to talk his reluctant son Hamnet into playing a female role. Hamnet is more into wrestling and hunting than the strange world of boy actors and is most unwilling to play a female on stage. His twin sister Judith, his mate Tom and Tom's conveniently-named sister Hermia combine with Meg the cheeky housekeeper to help out and create subsequent confusion. Right from the start the play moves at a cracking pace with much mirth and madness.The text is intended for the junior English classroom (14 – 15 year olds) but has also been used very successfully at the senior level (16 – 18 year olds). As well as the play, the book includes differentiated close-reading, language and writing activities. There are many pre-play and post-play activities making it a complete teaching package. This play is great for an accessible introduction to the Shakespearian world and as part of thematic teaching on fantasy, dream, friendship, imaginary worlds, growing up and family. There are many opportunities for class involvement in the readings, group activities, language and literary work in this attractive and practical text.This play effortlessly challenges and involves students and meets the requirements of the English and Drama curriculum’s key competencies. e.g. Using Language and Texts and Thinking. The play is a highly enjoyable exploration of a unique Elizabethan teenage world with plenty of oral, visual and written communication. Lots of thinking skills and differentiated activities. An accessible, attractive and well thought out and packaged text for busy teachers.Participating and Contributing, Relating to Others and Managing Self: An interactive and energetic text with plenty of group work and the chance for students to “participate and contribute actively in new roles”. This is an original, charming play and text that provides unique classroom opportunities. Will’s Twins is a superb new play that not only contains a charming but lively class drama text but also contains a number of introductory and post play language and literature activities. It contains great language, physical comedy and many other opportunities for a lively and enjoyable school production. The whole package means minimal preparation work for busy teachers.

Who decides the outcome of a child born to poverty, slavery, or simply the wrong skin tone or ethnic descent?  At our core beats a heart, bestowing the gift of life, but who has the right to determine how that life should be lived?  Come with writer, Shari McGriff, on a powerful journey from modern day, back in time, to turn-of-the century Australia.  A small child is chased down a dust-filled street and ripped from his mother’s arms.  “Dust-to-dust”, they say, “when we pass from one life to the next.”  Vignettes explored, take the reader on ‘The Trail of Tears’, to the farms of wealthy landowners and the gas chambers of Nazi Germany.  Families, decimated by greed and lust for power, stare at one another through tear-soaked eyes and a veil of forgetfulness.  These are generations robbed of everything: their heritage, past and future, their family ties, and even their names.  Surely, today things are different, more humane and civil.  There is no longer a ‘kill the Indian, save the child’ mentality…or is there?  The poor, the uneducated, and the inconvenient are victimized, as in days past.  We are all human.  Are we perpetrating our own ‘stolen generation’?  Deeply moving and forcefully conveyed, this is a short story that will impact the way you look at love, life, and the need to embrace the human family.  Free your mind from all earthly cares and spend a few precious minutes in the soul of a child, desperate to share the joys…and sorrows…that are our existence.

But when he ditches her at a gas station a few decades into their eternity together, she realizes that being young forever actually means working graveyard shifts at Taco Bell, sleeping in seedy motels, and being supernaturally compelled to follow your ex from town to town―at least until Holly meets Elton’s other exes.  It seems that Holly isn’t the only girl Elton seduced into this wretched existence. He turned Ida in 1921, then Rose in 1954, and he abandoned them both before Holly was even born. Now Rose and Ida want to kill him before he can trick another girl into eternal adolescence, and they’ll need Holly’s help to do it. And once Holly starts falling for Elton’s vulnerable new conquest, Parker, she’ll do anything to save her.  To kill Elton for good, Holly and her friends will have to dig up their pasts, rob a bank, and reconcile with the people they’ve hurt in their search for eternal love. And to win the girl, Holly will have to convince Parker that she’s more than just Elton’s crazy ex―even though she is trying to kill him.

He woke up one morning to find his house empty . . . his street empty . . . his whole town empty . . . empty except for an eerie, creeping fog—and whatever creatures were slowly moving toward him through the fog.

With the fog closing in and the hungry creatures of the fog surrounding him, he has only a few hours to find out how he lost the world he knew.

Neill hates being alone and wants to replace Carl with someone just like him; someone smart, artistic, caring-but why kid himself, there is no one like Carl. Neill and Sheila seem to have nothing in common except the French class her mother teaches. But invisible ties draw the two outliers together. Maybe it's the way Neill tries to protect Sheila from Julian's magnetism. Or the way Sheila fights to get Carl's family to let him be the man he wants to be. Neill and Sheila try everything to make life happy, including each other. But what they really need is Carl and Julian.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Schöne Kleider tragen und lächeln – das ist alles, was Elodeas Leben noch ausmacht. Denn Elodea war Teil einer Widerstandsgruppe aus Studentinnen, die sich gegen die Tyrannenherrschaft in Avendúr gewehrt hat und deren Mitglieder nun getrennt voneinander an den Adelshöfen des Landes auf Linie gebracht werden sollen. Doch plötzlich bekommen sie eine neue Chance, für ihre Ideen zu kämpfen.  Gleichzeitig suchen auch andere im Kampf der Ideologien ihren Weg: Avian, der von seinem Vater in das Amt des Vorsitzenden der Kirche gezwungen wurde, obwohl er als Atheist nichts vom Glauben hält, unterstützt aus Angst um seine Familie die Herrschenden und wird dafür von seiner Schwester verachtet. Lyonel, der verschollene Bruder der Königin, der aufgrund einer Behinderung von seiner Familie versteckt wurde, will sich mithilfe der Rebellen im Untergrund seinen Thron zurückerobern. Isobel, die als Gräfin in den Adelsstand geboren wurde, im Herzen aber eigentlich Demokratin ist, schmiedet heimlich Bündnisse für einen Umsturz.  Während Avendúrs psychisch labile Königin unbeirrbar ihre Ideologie der Herrschaft des Stärkeren verfolgt und das Land in einen Krieg führen will, verstricken sich die Rebellen immer mehr in einem Netz aus Schuld, Lüge und Verrat. Sie müssen sich entscheiden: Sind sie bereit, für ihre Ideale zu sterben?  Starke Fantasy für alle Fans von »Iron Flowers«, »Die Chroniken der Verbliebenen« und »Das Lied der Krähen«.

The nights of Tehran,Ghazālah ʻAlīzādah,young_adult_fiction,First published in 2021,/works/OL32069253W,/authors/OL11556063A/Ghazālah_ʻAlīzādah,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Mazda Publishers|Language English|Pages 513,"""""The Nights of Tehran"" is a story that takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, the years that led to the uprisings and tumult that toppled the monarchical regime and ended in the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution and the establishment of a theocracy in Iran. It is a story about the young people in those decades, the story of a generation, Alizadeh's own generation, which she called an idealistic generation of dreamers who believed in patriotism, freedom, justice, culture, and beauty. But it was also a ""lost generation."" ""The Nights of Tehran"" is also the story of Iran's capital city itself, albeit a Tehran that is schizophrenic. North Tehran, where much of the story takes place, is an affluent modern city with luxurious homes and gardens, whereas south Tehran, where a significant portion of the novel occurs, is poverty-stricken with dusty, windy, narrow alleyways and old dilapidated houses and flophouses. Alizadeh's Tehran is an imagined city, a construct of the creative mind of the writer. However, many readers who have lived or visited the Iranian capital city at that time will find the same city reflected in this novel""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Il termine sa première année de cégep, n'a pas vraiment d'amis ni de petite amie. Bien qu'il croise beaucoup de filles qu'il aimerait bien amener dans son lit. Mais il n'a pas cette chance, il en rêve seulement. Lorsque son père lui demande de trouver un emploi d'été, il se met à la recherche d'un petit boulot. Ses deux premières entrevues sont des fiascos mémorables, mais à la troisième, on lui offre un poste au Checkmart, un magasin à grande surface. Il doit faire l'inventaire, et comble de malheur, il doit compter. Au fil des chapitres, nous le suivons dans ses multiples tâches: compter les vêtements, la nourriture, la musique, les médicaments, les jouets, etc. Il fait aussi la connaissance de Karine et Hubert, des collègues de travail. Il sort, fait la fête, s'amuse. Une vie de jeunes, quoi. [SDM].  Une sorte de roman initiatique où un jeune homme un peu immature évoque, non sans humour, son premier emploi d'été dans un grand magasin. Un travail qui l'oblige à compter, lui qui déteste ça. Pourtant, à la fin de l'été, après tous ces calculs, il fait une grande constatation: il n'y a qu'un chiffre qui soit vraiment important: le nombre d'amis qu'on a. En effet, ce travail d'été aura été pour lui l'occasion de rencontrer deux vrais amis et peut-être un grand amour. Il est heureux, il semble avoir trouver sa place dans le monde.

To high-born Adelaide, whose wealthy family is forcing her into a loveless marriage, the Glittering Court represents something else: the chance to chart her own destiny, and adventure in an unspoiled, prosperous new land across the sea.  After a chance meeting with the dazzling Cedric Thorn, Adelaide poses as a servant to join the crop of impoverished girls he promises to transform into proper ladies. But her familiarity with upper class life comes with a price: she must hide her identity from her new friends, mysterious refugee Mira and fiery former laundress Tamsin, and most importantly, from Cedric himself—even though she’s falling in love with him.  Everything begins to crumble when Cedric discovers Adelaide’s ruse, and she catches the eye of a powerful young governor, who wants her for a wife. She didn’t leave the gilded cage of her old life behind just to become someone else's property. But nothing is as daunting—or as wonderful—as the potent, forbidden attraction simmering between Adelaide and Cedric. One that, if acted on, would make them both outcasts in a wild, dangerous, uncharted world, and possibly lead them to their deaths.

More than just a high school drama, Veronica Mars is a smart and savvy teen detective show that offers complex mysteries and rapier wit, engaging social commentary, and noir sensibilities—with the occasional murder thrown in for good measure. This collection, edited by the creator and executive producer of the show, offers supreme insight into the class struggles and love stories of the series. Essays by top writers intelligently address a multitude of questions, such as Is Veronica a modern-day vigilante? Why is a show that features rape, potential incest, and a teen girl outsmarting local authorities so popular with America’s conservative population? and Why is Veronica and Logan’s relationship the most important story-driving factor in the show?

""Listen, you're young. We don't send kids to jail. If you had something to do with this, it's better to tell us. Then we can help you. Maybe it was a friend of yours come to take care of things for you. You've got a nasty bruise there, and your neighbors told us that you tend to get a lot of bruises. We take those things into account, you know. We understand about things like that."" ""You don't understand anything,"" Jude said. After Jude watches his drug-dealer father get gunned down at the kitchen table, he's taken from their dangerous neighborhood to a comfortable home, an elite private school, and a mother he doesn't remember. Only fifteen, Jude is under suspicion for his father's murder, but to save his own life, he can't tell the police what he knows. To make things worse, Jude's mother is the district attorney. She can protect him from the police -- but when Jude's classmate overdoses on heroin, Jude is implicated, and his mother decides to prosecute. Jude is determined to clear his name, though he doesn't know that mysteries from his past have yet to be revealed -- secrets that will forever alter the course of his life. Jude's gripping story is at once moving and horrifying as it traces a young man's quest for acceptance and his incredible capacity for hope and resilience.

As Zee and Conor keep up a double life, and argue over the need to do so in what is, after all, their own hometown, the jealousies and petty hatreds of those around them come to a head. Conor is beaten up - but Zee pays for her 'disloyalty' by having her face slashed unmercifully and losing her looks forever.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Phyllis Marlowe's criticism of her first performance is hard to take, but not half as painful as Mike Horodinsky's ruthless verdict. Mike is one member of the apprentice group whom Carol thoroughly dislikes. Their antagonism flames into open warfare when Mike almost succeeds in getting Carol away from the stage altogether. However, when the real test comes, these young students meet it with such ingenuity and perseverance that even Carol and Mike forget their differences in the common bond of the theater.

The second third will become government employees, teachers, nurses, construction workers, businessmen or--women and live a comfortable and prosperous life.Trouble will be the only accomplishment of the last third, and they will be subject to the rules of the first two thirds.Jeremy, a biracial bastard child of a single teenage mother, was quickly labeled as being among the last third in his adolescence. With no friends, money, and a rapidly disintegrating relationship with his mother, Jeremy had little prospects to find a way out of his misery. As his anger climaxes--to the shock of the notorious and terrifying school bully--Jeremy seemingly seals his fate as a member of the last third.Enter Roy, an eccentric old curmudgeon, who has a fated encounter with Jeremy. As Roy introduces Jeremy to the fantastical world of aviation, an unexpected friendship grows. Can these two misfits find some beacon of hope in each other?In his story of adversity, growing up, and friendship, author Jonathan Mach presents a tale of life in the face of formidable obstacles and the meaningful relationships that blossom as a result.

Helen Vaughan doesn't know why she and her mother left their ancestral home at Harrowstone Hall, called Harrow, or why they haven't spoken to their extended family since. So when her grandfather dies, she's shocked to learn that he has left everything—the house, the grounds, and the money—to her. The inheritance comes with one condition: she must stay on the grounds of Harrow for one full year, or she'll be left with nothing.  There is more at stake than money. For as long as she can remember, Harrow has haunted Helen's dreams—and now those dreams have become a waking nightmare. Helen knows that if she is going to survive the year, she needs to uncover the secrets of Harrow. Why is the house built like a labyrinth? What is digging the holes that appear in the woods each night?And why does the house itself seem to be making her sick?  With each twisted revelation, Helen questions what she knows about Harrow, her family, and even herself. She no longer wonders if she wants to leave…but if she can.
