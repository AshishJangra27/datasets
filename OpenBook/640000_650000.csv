The second daughter of a Massachusetts pastor, Abigail longed to go to school like the boys of the Colonial days. Recognizing his daughter's inquisitive mind, Abigail's father instructed her at home using books from his large personal library. Smart and with strong opinions, Abigail was the constant confidante of her husband, President John Adams. The mother of five, she lived in France and England, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. She was the first president's wife to live in the White House, and the first woman to be the wife of a U.S. president and the mother of another U.S. president. For the cause of liberty, Abigail and John were frequently apart. Through the more than 1,100 letters they exchanged, history has an insightful look at the extraordinary people who crafted the Great American Experiment - the United States of America.

"The illustrated book about South America, including Mexico and Central America",Benjamin Appel,juvenile_literature,First published in 1960,/works/OL6447077W,/authors/OL1709791A/Benjamin_Appel,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL5812277M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1960|Publisher  Grosset & Dunlap|Language English|Pages 101,"To the south of the United States lies an exciting world. It is a world of stupendous natural contrasts, volcanoes and unexplored jungles, luxuriant islands and endless prairies, mountains as desolate as the moon, and a river containing an island bigger than France! It is a world of blending cultures — Indian, Hispanic, African — the combination of which has produced a unique, vigorous civilization.    The cities of these Latin-American countries range in the extreme from the most modern metropolises to those where stone streets existed even before the Spaniards came. Their architecture is among the most interesting in the world, contrasting as it does ancient ruins, city walls, colonial cathedrals with bright-colored skyscrapers of ultra-modern design.    The eyes of America, especially those of young America, will increasingly be focused on this bursting vigorous world, which will, it is calculated, pass the United States and Canada in population by 1970. Containing as it does vast fertile areas as yet relatively unpopulated, there are no visible limits to its present and future possibilities.    The people range from the Indians of the Andean highlands — who live almost as they did when the Inca. ""Lord of the four corners of earth,"" ruled from Colombia to Chile — to the city dwellers of Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Santiago, whose culture seems an extension of Europe. There are unconquered Indians inhabiting the same countries as vital businessmen in Mexico, Colombia or Brazil, who are so busy that they even work through the siesta. But no matter how different the people of Latin America are in color, race or cultural background, a common bond of Latin culture, as well as language, unites all the peoples from Rio Bravo to the Tierra del Fuego.    But there is something that we. too. have in common with Latin Americans. We share a democratic heritage. Most of the countries are republics which have broken away from the European motherland that colonized them. One of the outstanding features of this book is the concise but comprehensive story of how these countries attained independence and of their continuous strivings toward democracy. As Americans in a world of power politics, it is to our interest to know the heritage and environment of those who are, in effect, our natural allies. Charles F.

Florence's husband Sam was a coal miner in Kentucky. Miners went on strike until they could get better pay, safer working conditions, and health care. The company hired thugs to attack the organizers like Sam Reece. Writer George Ella Lyon tells this hair-raising story through the eyes of one of Florence's daughters, a dry-witted pig-tailed gal, whose vantage point is from under the bed with her six brothers and sisters. The thugs' bullets hit the thin doors and windows of the company house, the kids lying low wonder whether they're going to make it out of this alive, wonder exactly if this strike will make their lives better or end them, but their mother keeps scribbling and singing.

He also suggests that each of them bring a plate of their national food. Since his classmates and friends come from all over the world, they are looking forward to some German kuchen, Czech dumplings, Hungarian cherry soup, Italian pasta, Spanish paella and, of course, Canadian turkey. Cica wants to be first to prepare dinner, but when it takes too long and everyone is famished, they crowd into the kitchen and find her crying beside her ruined French souffle. It seems she forgot to turn on the oven–no wonder the souffle failed to rise.Ariella quickly comes to the rescue, heating and serving the Polish borscht she has brought. Daniel, who is from the Czech Republic, prepares some magnificent plum-filled dumplings. Dinner is a success. Next morning, Mickey’s German breakfast is enjoyed by everyone, except for Cica who is missing from the table. They search the cottage, the boats, the whole island, but can’t find Cica anywhere. The following meals are eaten in silence, but the Chinese fortune cookies served with one meal suggest, in several languages, that Cica will be found safe.As they continue to search for her, they learn the history of the Thousand Islands, the Canadians and Americans who own them, and the famous castle which was built by a Germanborn American hotel owner for his wife. Boldt Castle is modeled after the castles along the Rhine River. The friends use boats to check the other islands, as well as Brockville, a nearby town where the oldest railway tunnel in North America was built 150 years ago. Although they keep returning to Zavikon (the name means “happy wigwam” in the Native Peoples’ language), hoping that Cica will show up, they must prepare and eat many interesting meals without her.As Puppo is busy in the kitchen preparing Thanksgiving dinner, the others are swimming, fishing and playing on the dock. Christopher notices a sailboat approaching. In it is a guest he has invited from Madawaska and she is holding a little cat in her lap. They are so happy to have Cica back that they forget their anger that she has spoiled their weekend. Cica explains that she was so ashamed of her failed souffle that she decided to leave during the night. She was going to swim to shore but boards a passing saliboat, thinking it is headed for shore. Instead the sailboat moors on Madawaska Island, and she spends two days in the boat, feeding on small fish and listening to beautiful music until she hears that the owners have been invited to Zavikon Island for Thanksgiving Dinner. With great relief, she returns to her friends.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
