Basic mathematics for technical occupations,Ronald Bohuslov,mathematics,First published in 1976,/works/OL13309647W?edition=ia%3Abasicmathematics0000bohu,/authors/OL6208198A/Ronald_Bohuslov,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21128403M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1976|Publisher  Prentice-Hall|Language English|Pages 512,"Basic Mathematics for Technical Occupations contains the mathematics necessary to understand and solve problems in technical and trade vocations. An awareness of numbers and a desire to achieve mathematical skills are the only prerequisites for mastery of the material.    The computations and techniques are designed to motivate understanding and appreciation of the principles used in technical mathematics. Each topic is developed through realistic examples, discussions, illustrations, 'and pertinent problems using the latest data and information. The problems are from the major occupational areas and are designed to encourage the student to develop problem-solving techniques as well as manipulative skills.    Content and arrangement of chapters give the instructor maximum flexibility in choosing the course content to meet the needs of individual classes. Most chapters are limited to two or three major topics, and are organized around a principle or idea in such a manner that the student is able to comprehend a complete concept or procedure in one or two class periods. Practice Tests enable the student to evaluate his or her progress.    The text contains:    Approximately:    400 worked examples 6,000 problems 350 illustrations           Tables of Interrelation of Units of Measurement (U. S. Customary and Metric) Answers to odd-numbered problems Answers to Practice Tests List of mathematical symbols    Chapters 1 through 5 contain the important concepts of place value and the number line, rounding off, significant digits, measurements, and the arithmetic of the whole numbers. To avoid cumbersome computations while studying these ideas, only positive whole numbers are used. In chapters 6 through 14 these concepts are applied to fractions, decimals, percent, basic geometry, basic trigonometry, and basic algebra.    Although this book is specifically designed for students in technical occupations, it also meets in a very real way the needs of general mathematics students. Arithmetic processes are reviewed, and concepts ranging from whole numbers through basic algebra are developed and explored. The use of current, realistic situations enables the nontechnical student to relate mathematics to practical values and concrete ideas.    In appreciation of assistance and cooperation, I express my gratitude to The staff of Prentice Hall, especially Cary F. Baker, Margaret McAbee, and Steve Lux;    The reviewers, especially Edwin Conry,   Orange Coast College; The College of Alameda, especially the Transportation Division; My students, especially Jim Thomsen.

Most math teachers really don't 'get' math, they know it, but they don't really know it well enough to explain it from the ground up. In this way Crowhurst's math books are very much like Feynman's physics. He understands the subject so well that the complex topics become intuitive.

Discreto e continuo,Paolo Zellini,mathematics,First published in 2022,/works/OL34319305W,/authors/OL1208379A/Paolo_Zellini,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL46539529M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Adelphi|Language Italian|Pages 406,"«A partire dalla Grecia, la scienza è una sorta di dialogo fra il continuo e il discreto» scriveva Simone Weil. Un dialogo inevitabile perché il continuo e il discreto «sono un dato della mente umana, che pensa necessariamente l’uno e l’altro, ed è naturale che passi dall’uno all’altro». Più che categorie della Natura – a cui si potrebbero assimilare le immagini del mare e dei granelli di sabbia – continuo e discreto sono «i poli di una fondamentale complementarità del pensiero di tutti i tempi» e le loro applicazioni arrivano ovunque: dai numeri irrazionali ai pixel che compongono le immagini digitali, agli algoritmi proliferanti su cui si regge il nostro mondo. In questo libro magistrale Paolo Zellini non si limita a ripercorrere – con la precisione e la profondità di indagine che lo contraddistinguono – la storia della millenaria contesa tra due potenze complici e nemiche, ma va molto oltre: ci aiuta finalmente a delimitarne i territori, risvegliandoci dal «sonno dogmatico» che impediva di coglierne i rispettivi ruoli. Fin dall’antichità siamo abituati a pensare il continuo come un primum, un insieme ideale, autosufficiente, ovunque denso e compatto, da cui ogni cosa ha origine. Allo stesso tempo, per ragioni di utilità ed efficacia, accettiamo che quel primum si trovi anche in mezzo ai numeri, e quindi nel discreto. Eppure, afferma Zellini «ciò che conosciamo effettivamente è solo il discreto» e tutto il calcolo moderno si basa sull’informazione insita nelle serie di numeri che approssimano elementi di un continuo che non potremo conoscere mai. Perché dunque non capovolgere la prospettiva e pensare il continuo come «un’approssimazione del discreto»? Questa l’audace tesi di Zellini, che ruota intorno al circolo vizioso par excellence della matematica, lasciandone intravedere una possibile via d’uscita.    Ma allora che cosa resta del continuo? È davvero qualcosa di cui dovremmo o potremmo disfarci? Sarebbe un grave errore pensarlo. Anche se inconoscibile, il continuo rimane un presupposto ineliminabile, un abisso senza fondo «più oscuro e impenetrabile dello stesso infinito». E «nelle tenebre di quell’abisso, di quella totalità amorfa e indefinibile che ci circonda da ogni parte, non smette mai di brillare immutato un tesoro».

The text includes examples and problems. The author takes a computer-assisted approach to problem-solving, which allows the student to focus on underlying techniques. The software package CALIPSO is bound in the back of the text.  Using CALIPSO, the student can perform a variety of complex operations with a minimum of effort. These operations include the Gauss-Jordan elimination methods, the geometric and simplex methods for solving linear programming problems, matrix operations and a variety of statistical and logical procedures. CALIPSO makes it possible to include more realistic applied problems, since students do not have to solve entire problems by hand. For example, CALIPSO performs the calculations necessary to solve complex problems involving interest rates, annuities and amortization. Instructions for using the package are integrated throughout the text.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nilpotence criteria, infinite dimensional variants of Lie's theorem for solvable systems of bounded operators, spectral properties of elements of semisimple Lie algebras and simultaneous triangularisation are expounded. The book is self-contained and features an extensive bibliography. It is aimed at postgraduate students and researchers who are introduced to an interesting recent area of research and will learn some new methods useful for both of the domains - operator theory and Lie algebra theory.

The utility of ""Boolean algebra"" in computing has greatly increased curiosity in the nature and extent of his achievements. His work is most accessible in his two books on logic, ""A mathematical analysis of logic"" (1947) and ""An investigation of the laws of thought"" (1954). But at various times he wrote manuscript essays, especially after the publication of the second book; several were intended for a non-technical work, ""The Philosophy of logic"", which he was not able to complete. This volume contains an edited selection which not only relates them to Boole's publications and the historical context of his time, but also describes their strange history of family, followers and scholars have treid to confect an edition. The book will appeal to logicians, mathematicians and philosophers, and those interested in the histories of the corresponding subjects; and also students of the early Victorian Britain in which they were written.

A rational theory of continuum thermomechanics that takes into account the existence and distribution of scalar and vector discontinuities is presented. Guiding the work is the notion that discontinuities should be modeled by the torsion and curvature tensors (Cartan), thus forming an attractive alternative way of representing dissipating continua with singularities. Also emphasized in this study is the relationship between singularities and certain irreversible properties that occur in solid and fluid models. The required mathematical background is given in several appendices, although some basic understanding of differential geometry and tensor analysis would be helpful. The book is largely self-contained and should serve a readership of graduate students, researchers, and engineers in applied mathematics, mechanics, and physics.

It consists of 20 selected survey papers that represent updated (mainly plenary) addresses to the IWOTA 2000 conference held at Bordeaux from June 13 to 16, 2000. The main subjects of the volume include: - spectral analysis of periodic differential operators and delay equations, stabilizing controllers, Fourier multipliers; - multivariable operator theory, model theory, commutant lifting theorems, coisometric realizations; - Hankel operators and forms; - operator algebras; - the Bellman function approach in singular integrals and harmonic analysis, singular integral operators and integral representations; - approximation in holomorphic spaces. These subjects are unified by the common ""operator theoretic approach"" and the systematic use of modern function theory techniques.

The topics include dilation and interpolation problems, reproducing kernel spaces, numerical ranges of operators, Riccati equations, harmonic analysis, spectral theory of differential operators and analytic operator functions to scattering of waves. All papers deal with operators in Banach or Hilbert spaces, or in spaces with an indefinite metric. This volume is dedicated to Israel Gohberg, one of the founding fathers of the IWOTA worskhops and an outstanding leader in operator theory. His work had a deep influence on the field and its range of applications. The IWOTA Groningen 1998, the tenth in its series, was a good occasion for a pre-celebration of his 70th birthday. This book also contains the speeches held at the workshop dinner, a review of Israel Gohberg's contributions to mathematics and a complete list of his publications. The book is of interest to a wide audience of pure and applied mathematicians.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book is addressed to all specialists interested in nonlinear functional analysis and its applications, but also to postgraduate students who want to get in touch with this important field of modern analysis.

This monograph, aimed at researchers and students in these fields, explores several aspects of this relationship. The primary focus of the text is the nontangential maximal function and the area function of a harmonic function and their probabilistic analogues in martingale theory. The text first gives the requisite background material from harmonic analysis and discusses known results concerning the nontangential maximal function and area function, as well as the central and essential role these have played in the development of the field.The book next discusses further refinements of traditional results: among these are sharp good-lambda inequalities and laws of the iterated logarithm involving nontangential maximal functions and area functions. Many applications of these results are given. Throughout, the constant interplay between probability and harmonic analysis is emphasized and explained. The text contains some new and many recent results combined in a coherent presentation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book begins with his biography and list of publications. It contains a selection of research papers, most of which are devoted to spectral analysis of operators or operator pencils with applications to ordinary and partial differential equations. Other papers deal with time-varying systems, interpolation and factorization problems, and topics from mathematical physics. About half of the papers contain further developments in the theory of operators in spaces with an indefinite metric and treat new applications.

Most of the mathematicians invited to the conference have been influenced in one way or another by Brieskorn's work in singularity theory. It was the first time that so many people from the Russian school could be present at a conference in singularity theory outside Russia. This volume contains papers on singularity theory and its applications, written by participants of the conference. In many cases, they are extended versions of the talks presented there. The diversity of subjects of the contributions reflects singularity theory's relevance to topology, analysis and geometry, combining ideas and techniques from all of these fields, as well as demonstrating the breadth of Brieskorn's own interests.

They also provide new ideas and problems in operator theory. As a consequence, the biannual MTNS (Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems) conference is attended by many operator theorists. At the initiative of J.W. Helton and I. Gohberg, an International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA) has been organized since the early 80s, as a satellite of MTNS. The articles in this volume originated from the IWOTA conference held at Indiana University, Bloomington, in June 1996. They represent most of the areas that were discussed at the workshop with some emphasis on modern interpolation theory, a topic which has seen much progress in recent years. The contributions were, as usual, subject to a thorough refereeing process and will bring the reader to the forefront of current research in this area.

After the setting of a problem, attention is focused on existence theorems that lead to the construction of approximate solutions. The coefficients of the equations, the shape of the domain, and the right-hand sides of the equations are considered to be controls. Applications include optimization problems arising in mechanics of elastic solids, plates, shells, composite materials and structures fabricated with them, as well as fluid mechanics. The monograph is written in an accessible and self-contained manner. It will be of interest to research mathematicians and science engineers working in solid and fluid mechanics, and in optimization theory of partial differential equations. Moreover, it is suitable as a textbook for graduate courses in optimization of elliptic systems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The present work, after providing a survey of the state of the art in multiobjective optimization, gives new insight into this important mathematical field by consequently taking up the viewpoint of differential geometry. This approach, unprecedented in the literature, very naturally results in a generalized homotopy method for multiobjective optimization which is theoretically well-founded and numerically efficient. The power of the new method is demonstrated by solving two real-life problems of industrial optimization. The book presents recent results obtained by the author and is aimed at mathematicians, scientists, students and practitioners interested in optimization and numerical homotopy methods.

The first two chapters cover algebraic foundations of the theory of torsions and various topological constructions of torsions due to K. Reidemeister, J.H.C. Whitehead, J. Milnor and the author. We also discuss connections between the torsions and the Alexander polynomials of links and 3-manifolds. The third (and last) chapter of the book deals with so-called refined torsions and the related additional structures on manifolds, specifically homological orientations and Euler structures. As an application, we give a construction of the multivariable Conway polynomial of links in homology 3-spheres. At the end of the book, we briefly describe the recent results of G. Meng, C.H. Taubes and the author on the connections between the refined torsions and the Seiberg-Witten invariant of 3-manifolds. The exposition is aimed at students, professional mathematicians and physicists interested in combinatorial aspects of topology and/or in low dimensional topology. The necessary background for the reader includes the elementary basics of topology and homological algebra.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Criteria for the normal solvability of such operators are established and several methods for describing the kernel and image spaces of the operators are presented. The approach is based on the idea of modelling discontinuities with an ""infinite index"" by appropriate inner functions, especially by infinite Blaschke products. The corresponding techniques have been elaborated by the authors during the last two decades, and they are applicable to both symbols with slowly and rapidly increasing arguments. Moreover, the book reveals exciting connections between invariant subspaces of the shift operator, bases in Banach spaces, and various classes of entire and meromorphic functions. The book aims at making advanced topics accessible to a broad readership. It is addressed to graduate and postgraduate students and to mathematicians interested in functional analysis, the theory of functions of a complex variable, or mathematical physics.

Flow models are used when there is a flow of information or materials, such as fluid of money or energy between the components of a system. They are widely used in biomedicine but have also useful applications in studying ecosystems, input-output analysis, competition, models, and epidemology. In order to provide a complete and balanced presentation, the book is organized in four parts. Part 1 is devoted to the theory of digraphs; Part 2 addresses Markov chains; Part 3 discusses differential equations; and Part 4 presents the theory of compartmental models, addressing the relations between dynamics of the solution and structure of the model. Key applications discussed include ecosystem models, fluid transfer, competition models, tracer kinetic experiments, and network flows. Essential topics and methods are presented in an accessible style with many examples: directed graphs, differential equations, Markov chains, and compartmental model construction. The material provides a thorough and comprehensive presentation of compartmental models, model construction and applications. All advanced students, practitioners and professionals in bioscience and applied mathematical modeling will find the book a useful and excellent reference.

Having been used mainly as a tool for the study of finite dimensional objects, the emphasis has changed and they are now frequently studied for their own independent interest. On the one hand this is a collection of closely related articles on infinite dimensional Kähler manifolds and associated group actions which grew out of a DMV-Seminar on the same subject. On the other hand it covers significantly more ground than was possible during the seminar in Oberwolfach and is in a certain sense intended as a systematic approach which ranges from the foundations of the subject to recent developments. It should be accessible to doctoral students and as well researchers coming from a wide range of areas. The initial chapters are devoted to a rather selfcontained introduction to group actions on complex and symplectic manifolds and to Borel-Weil theory in finite dimensions. These are followed by a treatment of the basics of infinite dimensional Lie groups, their actions and their representations. Finally, a number of more specialized and advanced topics are discussed, e.g., Borel-Weil theory for loop groups, aspects of the Virasoro algebra, (gauge) group actions and determinant bundles, and second quantization and the geometry of the infinite dimensional Grassmann manifold.

This book provides the first detailed study of their relatively brief but nonetheless influential foray into the field of mathematics. The careers of a generation of pathbreakers in modern mathematics, such as S.Banach, B.L.van der Waerden and André Weil, were decisively affected by their becoming fellows of the Rockefeller-funded International Education Board in the 1920s. To help promote cooperation between physics and mathematics Rockefeller funds supported the erection of the new Mathematical Institute in Göttingen between 1926 and 1929, while the rise of probability and mathematical statistics owes much to the creation of the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris by American philanthropy at about the same time. This account draws upon the documented evaluation processes behind these personal and institutional involvements of philanthropies. It not only sheds light on important events in the history of mathematics and physics of the 20th century but also analyzes the comparative developments of mathematics in Europe and the United States. Several of the documents are given in their entirety as significant witnesses to the gradual shift of the centre of world mathematics to the USA. This shift was strengthened by the Nazi purge of German and European mathematics after 1933 to which the Rockefeller Foundation reacted with emergency programs that subsequently contributed to the American war effort. The general historical and political background of the events discussed in this book is the mixture of competition and cooperation between the various European countries and the USA after World War I, and the consequences of the Nazi dictatorship after 1933. Ideological positions of both the philanthropists and mathematicians mattered heavily in that process. Cultural bias in the selection of fellows and of disciplines supported, and the economic predominance of American philanthropy, led among other things to a restriction of the programs to Europe and America, to an uneven consideration of European candidates, and to preferences for Americans. Political self-isolation of the Soviet Union contributed to an increasing alienation of that important mathematical culture from Western mathematics. By focussing on a number of national cultures the investigation aims to represent a step toward a true inter-cultural comparison in mathematics.

This work contains contributions presented at that conference and addresses four problem complexes mostly motivated by practical problems. The starting points are often questions taken from flight dynamics. The first chapter deals with existence theory and optimality conditions needed for justification of, and used in, numerical algorithms. Analysis and synthesis of control systems and dynamic programming are presented in the second chapter. A modern interpretation of a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is given. This is closely connected to the question of real-time or feedback control. Recent advances in the field of numerical methods and their applications to flight path optimization and fluid dynamics follow. The reader will find nonlinear programming methods, accelerated multiple shooting, homotopy and SQP methods. A wide variety of applications to mechanical and aerospace systems concludes this work: space flight problems, mobile robot controlling, geometrical extremal problems, fluid transport, fluid waves and human sciences.

The eminent Italian mathematician Vito Volterra played a decisive and widely acknowledged role in these developments. Volterra's specific project was to transfer the model and the concepts of classical mechanics to biology, constructing a sort of ""rational mechanics"" and an ""analytic mechanics"" of biological associations. The new subject was thus to be equipped with a solid experimental or at least empirical basis, also in this case following the tried and tested example of mathematical physics. Although very few specific features of this reductionist programme have actually survived, Volterra's contribution was decisive, as is now universally acknowledged, in encouraging fresh studies in the field of mathematical biology. Even today, the primary reference in the literature of the field of population dynamics consists of Volterra's work and the descriptive schemata (the ""models"", in modern parlance) he proposed. The present book aims to fill this historiographic gap by providing an exhaustive collection of the correspondence between Volterra and numerous other scientists on the topic of mathematical biology. The book begins with an introductory essay by Ana Millán Gasca, which aims at giving a picture of the research field of biomathematics in the ""Golden Age"", and shows the importance of the correspondence in this context. This is followed by a transcript of the correspondence ordered by the correspondent's name. Each item is preceded by a biographical profile of the correspondent and accompanied by notes containing information and references to facilitate understanding. The book will be found useful not only by science historians but also by all those - in particular, biomathematicians and biologists - with an interest in the origins of and events in a branch of learning that has undergone an astonishing development. Many of the problems discussed - in particular that of empirical verification - appear extremely topical even today and in some cases could even fuel reflection on topics still open to research.

Since then, pseudo-holomorphic curves have taken on great importance in many fields. The aim of this book is to present the original proof of Gromov's compactness theorem for pseudo-holomorphic curves in detail. Local properties of pseudo-holomorphic curves are investigated and proved from a geometric viewpoint. Properties of particular interest are isoperimetric inequalities, a monotonicity formula, gradient bounds and the removal of singularities. A special chapter is devoted to relevant features of hyperbolic surfaces, where pairs of pants decomposition and thickthin decomposition are described. The book is essentially self-contained and should also be accessible to students with a basic knowledge of differentiable manifolds and covering spaces.

In addition, algorithms now provide the means to computationally study polytopes, to compute their parameters such as flag vectors, graphs and volumes, and to construct examples of large complexity. The papers of this volume thus display a wide panorama of connections of polytope theory with other fields. Areas such as discrete and computational geometry, linear and combinatorial optimization, and scientific computing have contributed a combination of questions, ideas, results, algorithms and, finally, computer programs.

Die Besprechung zur ersten Auflage ist nach wie vor aktuell. Aus den Besprechungen zur ersten Auflage: ""Aufgelockert durch viele Beispiele und Übungsaufgaben, wird die Theorie der Funktionen einer komplexen Veränderlichen bis zum Residuenkalkül entwickelt. Im Zentrum stehen die Integralsätze von Cauchy. Dabei begnügt sich der Autor oft nicht mit einem einzigen Beweis für einen Satz. Weitere Beweismöglichkeiten werden zumindest skizziert, oder man erhält genaue Angaben über die Orginalarbeiten. Ebenso wird auf die ursprüngliche Formulierung von Sätzen hingewiesen. Jeder Paragraph schließt mit historischen Hinweisen, die auch die persönliche Beziehungen der Beteiligten nicht ausklammert. So erfährt man natürlich die unterschiedlichen Standpunkte von Cauchy und Weierstrass. Neben den Themen, die in keinem Text zur Funktionentheorie fehlen dürfen, findet man auch ""Raritäten"", etwa: Eisensteins Zugang zu den trigonometrischen Funktionen mittels Reihen oder Ritts Satz über asymptotische Reihenentwicklung, welcher einen berühmten Satz von E. Borel enthält..Ein Werk, das allen Mathematikern die Funktionentheorie näherbringen kann."" # Elemente der Mathematik #1 ""Ergänzend ist ein Abschnitt mit Kurzbiographien von Abel, Cauchy, Eisenstein, Euler, Riemann und Weierstrass beigefügt.

The modern theory of elliptic boundary value problems in domains having conical or edge singularities on the boundary as well as the classical theory of elliptic boundary value problems and the original Kondratiev theory are presented. This material forms the foundation for the second part of the book which contains a new construction of pseudo-differential operators with symbols corresponding to the singularities of the boundary of different dimensions. This allows in particular to obtain complete asymptotic expansions of solutions near these singularities.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the important quadratic branching case, the path-valued process known as the Brownian snake is used to give a concrete and powerful representation of superprocesses. This representation is applied to several connections with a class of semilinear partial differential equations. On the one hand, these connections give insight into properties of superprocesses. On the other hand, the probabilistic point of view sometimes leads to new analytic results, concerning for instance the trace classification of positive solutions in a smooth domain. An important tool is the analysis of random trees coded by linear Brownian motion. This includes the so-called continuum random tree and leads to the fractal random measure known as ISE, which has appeared recently in several limit theorems for models of statistical mechanics. This book is intended for postgraduate students and researchers in probability theory. It will also be of interest to mathematical physicists or specialists of PDE who want to learn about probabilistic methods. No prerequisites are assumed except for some familiarity with Brownian motion and the basic facts of the theory of stochastic processes. Although the text includes no new results, simplified versions of existing proofs are provided in several instances.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The first theorem of this type, proved by M. G. Krein, was a far-reaching generalization of G. Szegö's result for the positive definite case. A continuous analogue of that theorem was proved by Krein and H. Langer. These results, as well as many generalizations and extensions, are thoroughly treated in this book. A unifying theme is the general problem of orthogonalization with invertible squares in modules over C*-algebras. Particular modules that are considered in detail include modules of matrices, matrix polynomials, matrix-valued functions, linear operators, and others. One of the central features of this book is the interplay between orthogonal polynomials and their generalizations on the one hand, and operator theory, especially the theory of Toeplitz marices and operators, and Fredholm and Wiener-Hopf operators, on the other hand. The book is of interest to both engineers and specialists in analysis.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It covers all aspects of computer science: theory and practice, architectures and algorithms, and logic and software systems, with an emphasis on the period of 1936–1980 but also including important earlier work. Offering papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Alan Turing and Nobert Wiener, the book documents the discoveries and inventions that created today's digital world. A brief essay by volume editor Harry Lewis, offering historical and intellectual context, accompanies each paper.  Readers will learn that we owe to Aristotle the realization that fixed rules of logic can apply to different phenomena—that logic provides a general framework for reasoning—and that Leibniz recognized the merits of binary notation. They can read Ada Lovelace's notes on L. F. Menabrea's sketch of an analytical engine, George Boole's attempt to capture the rules of reason in mathematical form, David Hilbert's famous 1900 address, “Mathematical Problems,” and Alan Turing's illumination of a metamathematical world. Later papers document the “Cambrian era” of 1950s computer design, Maurice Wilkes's invention of microcode, Grace Hopper's vision of a computer's “education,” Ivan Sutherland's invention of computer graphics at MIT, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman's pioneering work on encryption, and much more. Lewis's guided tour of a burgeoning field is especially welcome at a time when computer education is increasingly specialized.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Der Briefwechsel Hasse - Scholz - Taussky,Helmut Hasse,mathematics,,/works/OL20932191W,/authors/OL5461407A/Helmut_Hasse,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language German,"Arnold Scholz (1906-1941) war einer der vielversprechendsten jungen Zahlentheoretiker in den 1930er Jahren, einer der besten Kenner der Klassenkörpertheorie. Als Doktorand von Issai Schur war er auch mit gruppentheoretischen Methoden vertraut. Da er während des Dritten Reichs als politisch nicht zuverlässig galt (er war ein enger Freund des ebenfalls ?suspekten? Ernst Zermelo), konnte er keine sichere Stelle finden. Trotzdem gelang es ihm, eine Reihe wichtiger Resultate zu erhalten, u.a. bei der Realisierung von Galoisgruppen und in der Theorie der Normenreste. Der zu einem klaren Verständnis dieser Ergebnisse notwendige kohomologische Apparat war damals noch nicht entwickelt, und daher konnten zunächst nur Wenige mit den Scholzschen Ideen etwas anfangen. Eine Reihe seiner Resultate wurden später wiederentdeckt. Schafarewitsch konnte mit Hilfe der Scholzschen Methoden zeigen, dass jede endliche auflösbare Gruppe als Galoisgruppe einer Erweiterung der rationalen Zahlen vorkommt. Das vorliegende Buch, das als erster Schritt zu einem besseren Verständnis des Werks von Arnold Scholz anzusehen ist, enthält die Korrespondenz zwischen Arnold Scholz und Helmut Hasse einerseits und Olga Taussky andererseits, soweit sie in den Archiven der Universität Göttingen und des California Institute of Technology in Pasadena erhalten sind. Auch die Korrespondenz zwischen Hasse und Taussky bis zum frühen Tod von Arnold Scholz wurde aufgenommen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He was professor of mathematics at Jena University and is considered a key figure in the development of the mathematical sciences of the 17th Century. In particular, he is known to be the teacher of the young Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and other notable students. These proceedings record papers presented at an international colloquium held at the Göttingen State and University Library in collaboration with the Erhard Weigel Society based in Jena on December 5-6, 2014. The colloquium was concerned with Erhard Weigel and some of his many students as well as discussed his contribution to the history of science as an excellent educator. Moreover, the colloquium dealt with the flow of impact of his methods and ideas into the scientific community, whose members played a significant role in the scientific revolution of the 17th Century.

Elementary Mathematics: Patterns and Structure 4,Eugene Douglas Nichols,mathematics,First published in 1966,/works/OL16809017W,/authors/OL595970A/Eugene_Douglas_Nichols,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25433672M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1966|Publisher  Holt, Rineheart & Winston|Language English|Pages 480","Statement of Philosophy    Elementary Mathematics-Patterns and Structure is a series of eight textbooks designed for a basic eight-year course, plus a three-book accelerated sequence. The accelerated sequence can be used with selected pupils after the completion of the fourth book in the basic series.  This series is contemporary. The content and spirit are in harmony with the latest developments in mathematics curriculum and with suggestions made by many influential groups. The name, patterns and structure, is a true reflection of one of the emphases found in this series. The pupils discover patterns and are made aware of important relationships between operations and number systems, from the counting numbers through the real numbers. At the same time the structural characteristics of these systems and of mathematics in general are explored. While emphasis s placed on these structural characteristics, a thorough preparation in arithmetic skills is provided. There are regular reviews and practice exercises throughout the series.  In addition to the emphasis on structure and patterns in arithmetic, a consistent, intuitive development of basic geometric topics is provided. An introduction to coordinate geometry, which brings together ideas of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, is developed in a simple and interesting way. No essential part of mathematics which serves as a background for the of high school mathematics is omitted.  Thus, the series presents a balanced diet of essential parts of all pre-high school mathematics.  The discovery approach is used. A great deal of responsibility for learning is placed on the learner, as he is constantly guided by sequences of carefully paced questions leading to discoveries of new concepts and relations. The pupil is placed in the role of an active participant in the learning process. For example, by studying patterns the learner discovers the principles underlying the algorithms stemming from the positional nature of our numeration system.  While actively participating in the learning process, the pupil develops powers of logical thinking through skillfully designed series of questions carefully assessed as to their appropriateness for his maturity level. Written words, pictures, diagrams, and physical activities—all are exploited to the best advantage in developing the pupil's logical thinking ability. Thus, while learning to do mathematics well, he learns to understand it and to tell why he does what he does. He learns thereby to be self-reliant and to uncover his own errors.  The accelerated sequence provides pupils who have demonstrated excellent performance with an opportunity to proceed at a more rapid pace, to investigate many concepts in greater depth, and to begin the first formal course in elementary algebra earlier. No essential topics of pre-algebra mathematics are sacrificed in the process. This three-book accelerated sequence was created to meet the needs of pupils who, at an early age, display a clear-cut aptitude for mathematics. Thus, they can learn more rapidly and do not require as much practice material as other students of mathematics.  Thus, the main objectives of the series are:  ■   to develop in pupils understanding of and appreciation for the structure and patterns found in arithmetic and geometry;  ■   to develop and maintain arithmetic skills;  ■   to provide pupils with a thorough foundation in all aspects of pre-high school mathematics; and  ■   to enable pupils to understand the why, as well as the how, of basic mathematics.

Quantity theorists usually attribute this apparent anomaly to mismeasurement of the money stock.  In contrast, I use data on money, prices, and real activity in Pennsylvania from 1723 to 1774 and for the United States as a whole from 1790 to 1850 (when the money stock is better measured) to show that the long-run behavior of money and prices is well explained by the quantity theory in both periods, despite the differences in institutional arrangements, once growth in monetized transactions is taken into account""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Trade in ideal varieties,David Hummels,mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL5891495W,/authors/OL1453041A/David_Hummels,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Models with constant-elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences are commonly employed in the international trade literature because they provide a tractable way to handle product differentiation in general equilibrium.  However this tractability comes at the cost of generating a set of counter-factual predictions regarding cross-country variation in export and import variety, output per variety, and prices.  We examine whether a generalized version of Lancaster's 'ideal variety' model can better match facts.  In this model, entry causes crowding in variety space, so that the marginal utility of new varieties falls as market size grows.  Crowding is partially offset by income effects, as richer consumers will pay more for varieties closer matched to their ideal types.  We show theoretically and confirm empirically that declining marginal utility of new varieties results in: a higher own-price elasticity of demand (and lower prices) in large countries and a lower own-price elasticity of demand (and higher prices) in rich countries.  Model predictions about cross-country differences in the number and size of establishments are also empirically confirmed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Dating business cycle turning points,Marcelle Chauvet,mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL5891480W,/authors/OL1453037A/Marcelle_Chauvet,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper discusses formal quantitative algorithms that can be used to identify business cycle turning points.  An intuitive, graphical derivation of these algorithms is presented along with a description of how they can be implemented making very minimal distributional assumptions.  We also provide the intuition and detailed description of these algorithms for both simple parametric univariate inference as well as latent-variable multiple-indicator inference using a state-space Markov-switching approach.  We illustrate the promise of this approach by reconstructing the inferences that would have been generated if parameters had to be estimated and inferences drawn based on data as they were originally released at each historical date.  Waiting until one extra quarter of GDP growth is reported or one extra month of the monthly indicators released before making a call of a business cycle turning point helps reduce the risk of misclassification.  We introduce two new measures for dating business cycle turning points, which we call the ""quarterly real-time GDP-based recession probability index"" and the ""monthly real-time multiple-indicator recession probability index"" that incorporate these principles.  Both indexes perform quite well in simulation with real-time data bases.  We also discuss some of the potential complicating factors one might want to consider for such an analysis, such as the reduced volatility of output growth rates since 1984 and the changing cyclical behavior of employment.  Although such refinements can improve the inference, we nevertheless find that the simpler specifications perform very well historically and may be more robust for recognizing future business cycle turning points of unknown character""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Small noise asymptotics for a stochastic growth model,Noah Williams,mathematics,First published in 2003,/works/OL5891367W,/authors/OL1453002A/Noah_Williams,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""We develop analytic asymptotic methods to characterize time series properties of nonlinear dynamic stochastic models.  We focus on a stochastic growth model which is representative of the models underlying much of modern macroeconomics.  Taking limits as the stochastic shocks become small, we derive a functional central limit theorem, a large deviation principle, and a moderate deviation principle.  These allow us to calculate analytically the asymptotic distribution of the capital stock, and to obtain bounds on the probability that the log of the capital stock will differ from its deterministic steady state level by a given amount.  This latter result can be applied to characterize the probability and frequency of large business cycles.  We then illustrate our theoretical results through some simulations.  We find that our results do a good job of characterizing the model economy, both in terms of its average behavior and its occasional large cyclical fluctuations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

"Taylor rules, Mccallum rules, and the term structure of interest rates",Michael F.

See, for example, Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002).  The result echoes the policy rule used by McCallum (1994) to rationalize the empirical failure of the 'expectations hypothesis' applied to the term- structure of interest rates.  That is, rather than forward rates acting as unbiased predictors of future short rates, the historical evidence suggests that the correlation between forward rates and future short rates is surprisingly low.  McCallum showed that a desire by the monetary authority to adjust short rates in response to exogenous shocks to the term premiums imbedded in long rates (i.e. ""yield-curve smoothing""), along with a desire for smoothing interest rates across time, can generate term structures that account for the puzzling regression results of Fama and Bliss (1987).  McCallum also clearly pointed out that this reduced-form approach to the policy rule, although naturally forward looking, needed to be studied further in the context of other response functions such as the now standard Taylor (1993) rule.  We explore both the robustness of McCallum's result to endogenous models of the term premium and also its connections to the Taylor Rule.  We model the term premium endogenously using two different models in the class of affine term structure models studied in Duffie and Kan (1996): a stochastic volatility model and a stochastic price-of- risk model.  We then solve for equilibrium term structures in environments in which interest rate targeting follows a rule such as the one suggested by McCallum (i.e., the ""McCallum Rule"").  We demonstrate that McCallum's original result generalizes in a natural way to this broader class of models.  To understand the connection to the Taylor Rule, we then consider two structural macroeconomic models which have reduced forms that correspond to the two affine models and provide a macroeconomic interpretation of abstract state variables (as in Ang and Piazzesi (2003)).  Moreover, such structural models allow us to interpret the parameters of the term-structure model in terms of the parameters governing preferences, technologies, and policy rules.  We show how a monetary policy rule will manifest itself in the equilibrium asset-pricing kernel and, hence, the equilibrium term structure.  We then show how this policy can be implemented with an interest-rate targeting rule.  This provides us with a set of restrictions under which the Taylor and McCallum Rules are equivalent in the sense if implementing the same monetary policy.  We conclude with some numerical examples that explore the quantitative link between these two models of monetary policy""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Specifically, we explore the hypothesis that incentive problems in the labor market amplify differences in earnings due to gender differentials in home hours.  In turn, earnings differentials across genders reinforce the division of labor within the household.  This gives rise to a potentially self-fulfilling feedback mechanism.  As a consequence, gender differentials in earnings will be larger than any initial difference in relative productivity across genders.  Even if productivity in home and market work is the same for female and male workers, both gendered and ungendered equilibria are possible and equally likely.  If womens' comparative advantage in home production is large enough, there exists a unique equilibrium in which they have higher home hours and lower earnings than men.  Our model delivers predictions on the relation between earnings ratios, incentive pay and home hours.  First, gender earnings differentials should be higher for married workers in occupations in which the incentive problem is more severe.  This effect should be stronger when the gender difference in home hours is greater.  Moreover, the difference in the fraction of incentive pay across genders should be smaller for higher values of the female/male earnings ratio.  Second, the husband/wife ratio of home hours should be negatively related with both the husband/wife earnings ratio and the difference in the fraction of incentive pay.  We use the Census and the PSID to study these predictions and find that they are amply supported by the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

What type of model is consistent with this finding? We explore this question using two models of fertility, the one by Barro and Becker (1989), and the one inspired by Caldwell and developed by Boldrin and Jones (2002).  In the Barro and Becker model parents have children because they perceive their children's lives as a continuation of their own.  In the Boldrin and Jones' framework parents procreate because the children care about their old parents' utility, and thus provide them with old age transfers.  The effect of increases in government provided pensions on fertility in the Barro and Becker model is very small, and inconsistent with the empirical findings.  The effect on fertility in the Boldrin and Jones model is sizeable and accounts for between 55 and 65% of the observed Europe-US fertility differences both across countries and across time and over 80% of the observed variation seen in a broad cross-section of countries.  Another key factor affecting fertility the Boldrin and Jones model is the access to capital markets, which can account for the other half of the observed change in fertility in developed countries over the last 70 years""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Essential differences in the ethos of mathematics, for example, the customary ways of undertaking and understanding mathematical procedures and their objects, provide insight into the fundamental issues in the quarrel of moderns with ancients. Two signal features of the modern ethos are the priority of problem-solving over theorem-proving, and the claim that constructability by human minds or instruments establishes the existence of relevant entities. These figures are combined in the emblematic statement of Salomon Maimon, ""In mathematical construction we are, as it were, gods."" Construction is the mark of modernity. The disciplines of classical philology, literary interpretation and the history of philosophy and of mathematics are woven together in this volume.

A fundamental asymmetry intrinsic to the method of instrumental variables is noted.  Recent advances in IV estimation allow for heterogeneity in responses but not in choices, and the method breaks down when both choice and response equations are heterogeneous in a general way""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We explore several financing scenarios, including first-best, monopolistic, syndicated and fully competitive financing.  We solve numerically for the entrepreneur's effort, the terms of financing, the venture capitalist's investment decision and NPV.  We find significant value losses due to holdup problems and under-provision of effort that can outweigh the benefits of staged financing and investment.  We show that a commitment to later-stage syndicate financing increases effort and NPV and preserves the option value of staged investment.  This commitment benefits initial venture capital investors as well as the entrepreneur""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Do bonds span volatility risk in the U.S. treasury market?,Torben G. Andersen,mathematics,First published in 2006,/works/OL5893934W,/authors/OL1453915A/Torben_G._Andersen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|Language English,"""We investigate whether bonds span the volatility risk in the U.S.  Treasury market, as predicted by most 'affine' term structure models.  To this end, we construct powerful and model-free empirical measures of the quadratic yield variation for a cross-section of fixed- maturity zero-coupon bonds ('realized yield volatility') through the use of high-frequency data.  We find that the yield curve fails to span yield volatility, as the systematic volatility factors are largely unrelated to the cross- section of yields.  We conclude that a broad class of affine diffusive, Gaussian-quadratic and affine jump-diffusive models is incapable of accommodating the observed yield volatility dynamics.  An important implication is that the bond markets per se are incomplete and yield volatility risk cannot be hedged by taking positions solely in the Treasury bond market.  We also advocate using the empirical realized yield volatility measures more broadly as a basis for specification testing and (parametric) model selection within the term structure literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago web site.

It gives special attention to the powerful matrix-based-multigrid approach, which is particularly useful for problems with variable coefficients and nonsymmetric and indefinite problems. The approach used here applies not only to model problems on rectangular grids but also to more realistic applications with complicated grids and domains and discontinuous coefficients. The discussion draws connections between multigrid and other iterative methods such as domain decomposition. The theoretical background provides insight about the nature of multigrid algorithms and how and why they work. The theory is written in simple algebraic terms, and therefore, requires preliminary knowledge only in basic linear algebra and calculus.

Perspectives on the Teaching of Geometry for the 21st Century,V.

However, new trends have begun to counteract this tendency. There is an increasing awareness that geometry plays a key role in mathematics and learning mathematics. Although geometry has been eclipsed in the mathematics curriculum, research in geometry has blossomed as new ideas have arisen from inside mathematics and other disciplines, including computer science. Due to reassessment of the role of geometry, mathematics educators and mathematicians face new challenges. In the present ICMI study, the whole spectrum of teaching and learning of geometry is analysed. Experts from all over the world took part in this study, which was conducted on the basis of recent international research, case studies, and reports on actual school practice. This book will be of particular interest to mathematics educators and mathematicians who are involved in the teaching of geometry at all educational levels, as well as to researchers in mathematics education.

The theory was originally created by Harish-Chandra in the late 1950's and important additional contributions were made by many others in the succeeding years. The book attempts to give a definite treatment of these results from the spectral theoretic viewpoint. The harmonic analysis of spherical functions treated here contains the essentials of large parts of harmonic analysis of more general functions on semisimple Lie groups. Since the latter involves many additional technical complications, it will be very illuminating for any potential student of general harmonic analysis to see how the basic ideas emerge in the context of spherical functions. With this in mind, an attempt has been made only to use those methods (as far as possible) which generalize. Mathematicians and graduate students as well as mathematical physicists interested in semisimple Lie groups, homogeneous spaces, representations and harmonic analysis will find this book stimulating.

This largely self-contained text provides an intuitive and interdisciplinary treatment of Coxeter matroids, a new and beautiful generalization of matroids which is based on a finite Coxeter group. Key topics and features: * Systematic, clearly written exposition with ample references to current research * Matroids are examined in terms of symmetric and finite reflection groups * Finite reflection groups and Coxeter groups are developed from scratch * The Gelfand-Serganova theorem is presented, allowing for a geometric interpretation of matroids and Coxeter matroids as convex polytopes with certain symmetry properties * Matroid representations in buildings and combinatorial flag varieties are studied in the final chapter * Many exercises throughout * Excellent bibliography and index Accessible to graduate students and research mathematicians alike, ""Coxeter Matroids"" can be used as an introductory survey, a graduate course text, or a reference volume.

Operator Approach to Linear Problems of Hydrodynamics,Nikolay D. Kopachevsky,mathematics,First published in 2001,/works/OL19892403W?edition=ia%3Aoperatorapproach00kopa,/authors/OL3274358A/Nikolay_D._Kopachevsky,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27078804M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Birkhäuser Basel,              Imprint: Birkhäuser|Language English|Pages 384","This is the first volume of a set of two devoted to the operator approach to linear problems in hydrodynamics. It presents functional analytical methods applied to the study of small movements and normal oscillations of hydromechanical systems having cavities filled with either ideal or viscous fluids. The work is a sequel to and at the same time substantially extends the volume ""Operator Methods in Linear Hydrodynamics: Evolution and Spectral Problems"" by N.D. Kopachevsky, S.G. Krein and Ngo Zuy Kan, published in 1989 by Nauka in Moscow. It includes several new problems on the oscillations of partially dissipative hydrosystems and the oscillations of visco-elastic or relaxing fluids. The work relies on the authors' and their students' works of the last 30-40 years. The readers are not supposed to be familiar with the methods of functional analysis. In the first part of the present volume, the main facts of linear operator theory relevant to linearized problems of hydrodynamics are summarized, including elements of the theories of distributions, self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces and in spaces with an indefinite metric, evolution equations and asymptotic methods for their solutions, the spectral theory of operator pencils. The book is particularly useful for researchers, engineers and students in fluid mechanics and mathematics interested in operator theoretical methods for the analysis of hydrodynamical problems.

In the fall of 1964, 12 seniors (8 male, 4 female) at Joel Barlow High School in W. Redding, CT, under the tutelage of Mr. Dobelstein, became one of several (two dozen?) classes across the country to work with these experimental textbooks. The text was distributed in a series of paperback pamphlets with a pastel blue cover. Several texts were provided at the beginning of the school year and the authors wrote the next chapters as the students worked their way through the lessons. Mr. Dobelstein encouraged us to examine the text critically, and we delighted in discovering typos and submitting them back to Yale. At least once, we finished a booklet before the next one was printed and sent to us -- which we cheerfully celebrated. At times, if we finished a lesson on time, Mr. D. would spend the balance of the class time teaching ""football appreciation."" The young men relished it, but my recollection is that the young women conversed on a topic of more interest.    Morale was high; we'd been promised college credit for the class -- groundbreaking for the times.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Many recent developments in theoretical physics display aspects related to number theory, and this cooperation will be furthered by this volume. The authors from each discipline have taken pains to present their contributions in a manner that is attractive and understandable to readers from the other discipline. The subjects covered include: modular forms and applications to quantum field theory for strings, number theoretical aspects of the spectra of operators applied to the Hall effect, quasicrystals, almost periodic systems, the Riemann zeta function, applications of number theory to dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, lattices, stochastic processes and integrable systems.

G-Convergence and Homogenization of Nonlinear Partial Differential Operators,A. A. Pankov,mathematics,First published in 2009,/works/OL19846921W?edition=ia%3Aemclassaplusplus00pank,/authors/OL393455A/A._A._Pankov,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24086162M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 28, 2009|Publisher  Springer Netherlands|Pages 276","This volume deals with G-convergence and homogenization for various classes of nonlinear partial differential operators. Chapter 1 is devoted to some preliminary issues from nonlinear analysis as well as to G-convergence of abstract operators, including the case of abstract parabolic operators. Chapter 2 introduces details of the notion of strong G-convergence for nonlinear second order elliptic operators in divergence form, and in Chapter 3 the homogenization problem for rapidly oscillated nonlinear random homogenous elliptic operators is dealt with. On the basis of these results, almost periodic and periodic cases are studied. Finally, in Chapter 4, some of the previous results are extended to the case of nonlinear parabolic operators. The volume concludes with two appendices, one of which is devoted to homogenization of nonlinear difference schemes, while the other lists some open problems of relevance, and a bibliography. Audience: This work will be of interest to researchers whose work involves homogenization theory and its applications. It is also recommended for advanced courses in the fields of partial differential equations and nonlinear analysis.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The aim of the book is to provide the reader with a monograph that enables him to study systematically basic and advanced material on the recently developed theory of Poisson manifolds, and that also offers ready access to bibliographical references for the continuation of his study. Until now, most of this material was dispersed in research papers published in many journals and languages. The main subjects treated are the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket; the generalized Frobenius theorem; the basics of Poisson manifolds; Poisson calculus and cohomology; quantization; Poisson morphisms and reduction; realizations of Poisson manifolds by symplectic manifolds and by symplectic groupoids and Poisson-Lie groups. The book unifies terminology and notation. It also reports on some original developments stemming from the author's work, including new results on Poisson cohomology and geometric quantization, cofoliations and biinvariant Poisson structures on Lie groups.

The eventual goal is a general development of Shannon's mathematical theory of communication, but much of the space is devoted to the tools and methods required to prove the Shannon coding theorems. These tools form an area common to ergodic theory and information theory and comprise several quantitative notions of the information in random variables, random processes, and dynamical systems. Examples are entropy, mutual information, conditional entropy, conditional information, and discrimination or relative entropy, along with the limiting normalized versions of these quantities such as entropy rate and information rate. Much of the book is concerned with their properties, especially the long term asymptotic behavior of sample information and expected information. This is the only up-to-date treatment of traditional information theory emphasizing ergodic theory.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The equations, which are based on the statistical relation between streamflow and basin characteristics, use streamflow data and basin characteristics from U.S. Geological Survey streamflow-gaging stations within natural basins and with at least 8 years of data during 1961-90.  The State was divided into 11 hydrologic regions on the basis of previous studies.  The final equations for estimating mean annual and mean seasonal runoff were developed from 228 streamflow-gaging stations.  Contributing drainage area and mean annual or mean seasonal precipitation were determined to be the most significant basin characteristics in each region.

It briefly introduces to the theory of continuous-time systems and the design methods for analog filters. Time-discrete systems, the basic structures of digital filters, sampling theorem, and the design of IIR filters are widely discussed. Important parts of the book are devoted to the design of non-recursive filters and the effects of finite register length. The explanation of techniques like oversampling and noise shaping conclude the book. It is completed by an annex containing a selection of tables of filter parameters for Butterworth, Chbeyshev, Cauer, and Bessel filters. Furthermore, several computer routines for filter design programs are given.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It has had an incredible evolution over the past century, with new subfields constantly branching off and spectacular progress in certain directions, and at the same time, with many fundamental unsolved problems still to be tackled. In the spring of 2009 the first main workshop of the MSRI algebraic geometry program served as an introductory panorama of current progress in the field, addressed to both beginners and experts. This volume reflects that spirit, offering expository overviews of the state of the art in many areas of algebraic geometry. Prerequisites are kept to a minimum, making the book accessible to a broad range of mathematicians. Many chapters present approaches to long-standing open problems by means of modern techniques currently under development and contain questions and conjectures to help spur future research""--  ""1.

In this note we introduce some new ways of bounding the complexity of the fibers of jr.

Sources of lifetime inequality,Mark Huggett,mathematics,First published in 2007,/works/OL12233959W,/authors/OL5332831A/Mark_Huggett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English|Pages 40,"Is lifetime inequality mainly due to differences across people established early in life or to differences in luck experienced over the working lifetime? We answer this question within a model that features idiosyncratic shocks to human capital, estimated directly from data, as well as heterogeneity in ability to learn, initial human capital, and initial wealth -- features which are chosen to match observed properties of earnings dynamics by cohorts. We find that as of age 20, differences in initial conditions account for more of the variation in lifetime utility, lifetime earnings and lifetime wealth than do differences in shocks received over the lifetime. Among initial conditions, variation in initial human capital is substantially more important than variation in learning ability or initial wealth for determining how an agent fares in life. An increase in an agent's human capital affects expected lifetime utility by raising an agent's expected earnings profile, whereas an increase in learning ability affects expected utility by producing a steeper expected earnings profile.

We examine one such missile to determine whether performance can be improved if we allow a variable thrust magnitude together with engine gimbaling to provide control.  Two trajectory optimization programs were written to provide an initial answer to this problem.  Preliminary results indicate reductions in the time to intercept by as much as thirty percent over that obtained by the presently used guidance scheme.  With tuning of the programs it seems reasonable to expect even greater improvements and further investigation seems warranted.

They combine multiple models into one usually more accurate than the best of its components. Ensembles can provide a critical boost to industrial challenges - from investment timing to drug discovery, and fraud detection to recommendation systems - where predictive accuracy is more vital than model interpretability. Ensembles are useful with all modeling algorithms, but this book focuses on decision trees to explain them most clearly. After describing trees and their strengths and weaknesses, the authors provide an overview of regularization - today understood to be a key reason for the superior performance of modern ensembling algorithms. The book continues with a clear description of two recent developments: Importance Sampling (IS) and Rule Ensembles (RE). IS reveals classic ensemble methods - bagging, random forests, and boosting - to be special cases of a single algorithm, thereby showing how to improve their accuracy and speed. REs are linear rule models derived from decision tree ensembles. They are the most interpretable version of ensembles, which is essential to applications such as credit scoring and fault diagnosis. Lastly, the authors explain the paradox of how ensembles achieve greater accuracy on new data despite their (apparently much greater) complexity. This book is aimed at novice and advanced analytic researchers and practitioners - especially in Engineering, Statistics, and Computer Science. Those with little exposure to ensembles will learn why and how to employ this breakthrough method, and advanced practitioners will gain insight into building even more powerful models. Throughout, snippets of code in R are provided to illustrate the algorithms described and to encourage the reader to try the techniques.

From the moment our feet touch the floor in the morning until our head hits the pillow, numbers are everywhere. And yet most of us go through each day unaware of the mathematics that shapes our lives. In fact, many people go through life fearing and avoiding mathematics, making choices that keep it at arm's length or further. Even basic math - like arithmetic - can seem baffling. In Our Days Are Numbered, Jason Brown leads the reader through a typical day, on a fascinating journey. He shows us the world through a mathematician's eyes and reveals the huge role that mathematics plays in our lives. It lies hidden within the electronics we use, the banking we do, and even the leisure activities we enjoy. Whether we're putting a down payment on a new car, reading the financial pages, or listening to our favourite songs, math is behind it all. At once entertaining and informative, Our Days Are Numbered covers an array of mathematic concepts and explores the hidden links between mathematics and everyday life. Brown reveals that a basic understanding of math can make us more creative in the way we approach the world.""--Publisher's description.

The multiscale nature of this challenging field motivated the calling of the colloquium and reflects the central importance that the dispersion of particles in a flow has in various geophysical and environmental problems. The spreading of aerosols and soot in the air, the growth and dispersion of plankton blooms in seas and oceans, or the transport of sediment in rivers, estuaries and coastal regions are striking examples. These problems are characterized by strong nonlinear coupling between several dynamical mechanisms. As a result, processes on widely different length and time scales are simultaneously of importance.  Papers in this book describe state-of-the-art numerical modelling for particle-laden turbulent flow as well as detailing novel experimental techniques for monitoring and quantifying particle dispersion.""--Springer website.

It abandons conventional approaches to concentrate on explaining and illustrating the concepts that are at the heart of control theory.  It attempts to explain why the obvious is so obvious and seeks to develop a robust understanding of the underlying principles around which control theory is built. This simple framework is studded with reference to more detailed treatments and with interludes that are intended to inform and entertain. Overall this book intended as a companion on the journey through control theory and although the early chapters concentrate on simple ideas such as feedback and stability, later chapters deal with more advanced topics such as optimisation, distributed parameter systems and Kalman Filtering.

As more intensive variables are specified, more thermodynamic properties of a system are defined, and the equations that represent thermodynamic properties as a function of independent variables become more complicated.    This sequel to Robert Alberty's popular Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions describes how researchers will find Mathematica(r) a simple and elegant tool, which makes it possible to perform complex calculations that would previously have been impractical. Biochemical Thermodynamics: Applications of Mathematica(r) provides a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of biochemical thermodynamics using Mathematica(r) to practically resolve thermodynamic issues.    Topics covered include:   Thermodynamics of the dissociation of weak acids   Apparent equilibrium constants   Biochemical reactions at specified temperatures and various pHs   Uses of matrices in biochemical thermodynamics   Oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, and lyase reactions   Reactions at 298.15K   Thermodynamics of the binding of ligands by proteins   Calorimetry of biochemical reactions    Because Mathematica(r) allows the intermingling of text and calculations, this book has been written in Mathematica(r) and includes a CD-ROM containing the entire book along with macros that help scientists and engineers solve their particular problems.Note: CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included.

The maturity of the research in the discipline and the recent developments in commercial/industrial fuzzy databases provided an opportunity to produce this survey. Fuzzy Databases: Principles and Applications is self-contained, providing background material on fuzzy sets and database theory. It is comprehensive, covering all of the major approaches and models of fuzzy databases that have been developed, including coverage of commercial/industrial systems and applications. Background and introductory material are provided in the first two chapters. The major approaches in fuzzy databases comprise the second part of the volume. This includes the use of similarity and proximity measures as the fuzzy techniques used to extend the relational data modeling and the use of possibility theory approaches in the relational model. Coverage includes extensions to the data model, querying approaches, functional dependencies and other topics including implementation issues, information measures, database security, alternative fuzzy data models, the IFO model, and the network data models. A number of object-oriented extensions are also discussed. The use of fuzzy data modeling in geographical information systems (GIS) and use of rough sets in rough and fuzzy rough relational data models are presented. Major emphasis has been given to applications and commercialization of fuzzy databases. Several specific industrial/commercial products and applications are described. These include approaches to developing fuzzy front-end systems and special-purpose systems incorporating fuzziness.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

First-Order Logic and Automated Theorem Proving,Melvin Fitting,mathematics,First published in 1996,/works/OL19850264W?edition=ia%3Afirstorderlogica00fitt_478,/authors/OL234438A/Melvin_Fitting,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27038950M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Springer New York|Language English|Pages 348,"This graduate-level text presents fundamental concepts and results of classical logic in a rigorous mathematical style. Applications to automated theorem proving are considered and usable Prolog programs provided. It will serve both as a first text in formal logic and an introduction to automation issues for students in computer science or mathematics. The book treats propositional logic, first-order logic, and first-order logic with equality. In each case the initial presentation is semantic, to define the intended subjects independently of the choice of proof mechanism. Then many kinds of proof procedure are introduced. Results such as completeness, compactness, and interpolation are established, and theorem provers are implemented in Prolog. This new edition includes material on AE calculus, Herbrand's Theorem, Gentzen's Theorem, and related topics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dynamical systems theory and related numerical algorithms provide powerful tools for studying the solution behavior of differential equations and mappings. In the past 25 years computational methods have been developed for calculating fixed points, limit cycles, and bifurcation points. A remaining challenge is to develop robust methods for calculating more complicated objects, such as higher- codimension bifurcations of fixed points, periodic orbits, and connecting orbits, as well as the calcuation of invariant manifolds. Another challenge is to extend the applicability of algorithms to the very large systems that result from discretizing partial differential equations. Even the calculation of steady states and their linear stability can be prohibitively expensive for large systems (e.g. 10_3- -10_6 equations) if attempted by simple direct methods. Several of the papers in this volume treat computational methods for low and high dimensional systems and, in some cases, their incorporation into software packages. A few papers treat fundamental theoretical problems, including smooth factorization of matrices, self -organized criticality, and unfolding of singular heteroclinic cycles. Other papers treat applications of dynamical systems computations in various scientific fields, such as biology, chemical engineering, fluid mechanics, and mechanical engineering.

Depending on the considered application, substitutions can potentially improve the service level, reduce required safety stocks and total setup costs and times, utilize cost variations of input products, and reduce the amount of wastage. The main focus is the development of graphical modeling approaches for substitution options and of production planning models based on these approaches using mathematical programming. In addition to single-level dynamic lot-sizing models with substitutions, models for multi-level production systems with flexible bills-of-materials and recipes are devised. Also, a simulation-based optimization approach for a multi-location inventory system with substitutions is developed""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ideally it may mean the originality, freshness and enthusiasm of a new breakthrough in mathematical thought. The reader will feel this inspiration in all four seminal papers by Duistermaat, Guillemin and Hörmander presented here for the first time ever in one volume. However, as time goes by, the price researchers have to pay is to sacrifice simplicity for the sake of a higher degree of abstraction. Thus the original idea will only be a foundation on which more and more abstract theories are being built. It is the unique feature of this book to combine the basic motivations and ideas of the early sources with knowledgeable and lucid expositions on the present state of Fourier Integral Operators, thus bridging the gap between the past and present. A handy and useful introduction that will serve novices in this field and working mathematicians equally well.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This system of numbers was closely related to the ring of Schmieden and Laugwitz, developed independently a few years earlier. During the last thirty years the use of nonstandard models in mathematics has taken its rightful place among the various methods employed by mathematicians. The contributions in this volume have been selected to present a panoramic view of the various directions in which nonstandard analysis is advancing, thus serving as a source of inspiration for future research. Papers have been grouped in sections dealing with analysis, topology and topological groups; probability theory; and mathematical physics. This volume can be used as a complementary text to courses in nonstandard analysis, and will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in both pure and applied mathematics and physics.

These strands are then brought together to provide a context and to expose Connes` index theorem for foliated spaces, a theorem which asserts the equality of the analytic and the topological index (two real numbers) which are associated to a tangentially elliptic operator. An additional purpose of this exposition is preparing the way towards the more general index theorem of Connes and Skandalis. This index theorem describes the abstract index class in KO (CR(G(M))), the index group of the C-algebra of the foliated space, and is necessarily substantially more abstract, while the tools used here are relatively elementary and straightforward, and are based on the heat equation method.

Homotopy theory of higher categories,Carlos Simpson,mathematics,First published in 2012,/works/OL16576672W,/authors/OL772191A/Carlos_Simpson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 634,"""The study of higher categories is attracting growing interest for its many applications in topology, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics and category theory. In this highly readable book, Carlos Simpson develops a full set of homotopical algebra techniques and proposes a working theory of higher categories. Starting with a cohesive overview of the many different approaches currently used by researchers, the author proceeds with a detailed exposition of one of the most widely used techniques: the construction of a Cartesian Quillen model structure for higher categories. The fully iterative construction applies to enrichment over any Cartesian model category, and yields model categories for weakly associative n-categories and Segal n-categories. A corollary is the construction of higher functor categories which fit together to form the (n+1)-category of n-categories. The approach uses Tamsamani's definition based on Segal's ideas, iterated as in Pelissier's thesis using modern techniques due to Barwick, Bergner, Lurie and others""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
