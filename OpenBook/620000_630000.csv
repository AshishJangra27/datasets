In this simple and elegant counting book from the world's most renowned museum, numbers are introduced to children through masterpieces of art. Each number from one to ten has four pages devoted to it. First, readers are invited to search for how many of a certain object they can find in a single piece of art. Then, they turn the page to discover four different works illustrating that number. Information about each piece of art and its creator appear in the back of the book. While kids practice counting, adults will love the cultural richness and educational value of this tour through the Metropolitan Museum's collection: from Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings and tenth century Iranian art to the work of Vincent Van Gogh and Homer Winslow.

Es una forma simbólica de comenzar una nueva etapa en sus vidas. Un cambio de ritmo, un cambio de marcha que les permitirá conocerse de otra manera. También hay humor, intriga y aventura, sobre un paisaje lleno de historia y arte, con algún incidente y muchas sorpresas. Los protagonistas de Cambio de marcha vivirán unos días intensos que pondrán a prueba su resistencia física y su relación personal, al mismo tiempo que conocen lugares y personas que ya nunca podrán olvidar.  Así comienza la novela: “Raquel se estampó contra el suelo en la segunda o tercera curva después de Roncesvalles, al lado de una señal de tráfico, en un lugar con ortigas en la cuneta y flechas amarillas pintadas sobre el asfalto. Todo fue tan rápido que ni siquiera tuvo tiempo para gritar. Se estrelló de forma aparatosa pero casi en silencio, como si no quisiera molestar a los animales del bosque que atravesábamos.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The photographs capture the glory of sculptured landscapes, the fearsome forces of nature and the extraordinary diversity of plant and animal life. Specially commissioned artworks reveal what photographs - and the human eye - cannot grasp, by showing how natural forces work and shape the land. Page by page, the authors investigate the different elements that make up our world. You will discover exactly how much life on Earth depends upon a thin protective blanket of atmosphere, meet a deepwater fish that first appeared 400 million years ago, marvel at moving continents and oceans, and understand the urgent, challenging issues that affect the future of our planet. This is a book to immediately capture the interest of independent young readers, and for families and school groups to explore together. Practical experiments and projects add a vital extra element that encourages reader-involvement, increases understanding and subtly reinforces the learning experience.""--Hermes House.

Watts|Language English|Pages 127,"Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, Albert Einstein altered the way we view the physical world with his scientific theories. He wasn't the best student in school. He preferred to learn about subjects that interested him, such as mathematics and science. When he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute in 1900, Einstein struggled to find a job. He ended up working for the patent office in Bern, Switzerland. During this time, he wrote several theories, including the theory of relativity. His theories made him an important international figure and he traveled extensively to give lectures on his ideas. He won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1921 for his work. In 1933, Einstein moved to the United States to work at Princeton University and avoid persecution by the Nazis in Germany for speaking out against the government. He died in 1955, leaving our understanding of gravity, energy, matter, light, and time forever changed.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

It came into existence in 1947 amid one of the bloodiest conflicts of the 20th century -- the partition of India. This new country was envisioned as a land for Muslims living in India, who were a minority group among the dominant Hindus. The Indian Muslims felt a need for their own land, which was created by redrawing the national boundary lines of India and essentially lopping off parts of it to be a new nation -- Pakistan. But while this new country rejoices in the uniting power of Islam, that alone has not been enough to provide peace and stability. The peoples, cultures, and languages that make up Pakistan are many. Even among the 96% of Pakistanis who are Muslims, the interpretation and living expression of their religion differs. The political situation since the country was established has been full of conflict, with elected leaders being deposed every few years. - p. 5.

Most of us would change at least one thing about ourselves if we could. But real health and happiness aren't dependent on matching yourself against the unrealistic ideals of a model-thin body or a pumped-up body builder's bulging muscles. Instead, fitness and good nutrition are the two factors that can lead to physical and emotional health. When you were younger, your parents told you what to eat. They probably encouraged you to eat the foods that would provide you with the various nutrients you needed to grow. They may have also encouraged you to get regular exercise. But you're older now. You've begun to make your own decisions about what you eat and how active you are. Learning what your body needs to be healthy is an important part of becoming a responsible adult. Taking care of yourself makes sense if you want to be happy and enjoy life. This book will tell you how to be the best you can be!"" -- from publisher's website.

With the exception of the first chapter, the rest of the book focuses on the history from about the mid 1800s. The emphasis is on the individuals and events that made an important contribution to the growth and vitality of the community. Many of the characters in our stories are not as well known as the prominent people of the day but they have nevertheless been instrumental in building our city. The target audience is youths aged eight to twelve years. In the book, our readers will meet nine-year old Harry and his sister, Sarah, who is eleven. Both are interested in history. They experience Calgary and region of today while learning of the past. At the end of each chapter, we have included activity and reading suggestions that offer an opportunity to further explore the history of the pioneers of our community. Although there is extensive dialogue throughout the book, this is not a historical novel we emphasize historical accuracy in the events described.""--  ""Our two fictional heroes, Sarah and Harry, are back in Volume 2 to continue to explore Calgary's exciting early history. Even though a year has passed, these amazing kids are still eleven and nine years old respectively. In this book they will learn about the legends and the history of the aboriginal peoples in the Calgary area. Stories outline the life of Chinese immigrants and the contributions they made to the development of Calgary after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Early religious leaders were important in serving the spiritual and physical needs of the settlers and the aboriginal people in the territory. Join the journey of one of Calgary's first Europeans to homestead in the area as he travelled from his native Ireland through the United States before settling down here. Appreciate the many contributions of several women in helping to build the society we enjoy today. Many of these people are not the most prominent in our history but they all made important contributions to the foundation of Calgary.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In a clear, easy-to-follow format it explains how the best way to beat a stronger opponent (be it a friend, clubmate – or Dad!) is by cleverly forcing checkmate. Delightful and instructive positions from real games are used to show the 50 Deadly Checkmates that chess masters use to win their games.  For the beginner, simply learning the checkmating ideas and enjoying the examples will help develop the tactical skills needed to carry out attacks, combinations and sacrifices.  For the advanced player, many of these checkmating ideas will come as a revelation, having never been categorized before. Experts agree that pattern-recognition is vital to success in chess, and this book provides a wealth of valuable patterns.  How to Beat Your Dad at Chess makes improving easy and fun, and is full of helpful explanations and practical advice on how to approach chess games with confidence – and success.  Grandmaster Murray Chandler finished second in the World Cadet Championship in 1976, ahead of Garry Kasparov, whom he defeated in their individual game. He remains to this day one of the few players in the world with a 100% score against Kasparov. He was a key member of the England team that won the silver medals in Chess Olympiads three times during the 1980s, and went on to captain the team in 1994. He is a former proprietor and Editor-in-Chief of the British Chess Magazine and the author of several bestselling chess books.   Read more Read less",14 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Kendra soon finds herself on an epic adventure in the wilds of the outside world. Along the way, she will encounter the King of the Dwarves, a magic-peddling Faun, and all manner of strange creature. And, once again, she will cross paths with the young Unger called Trooogul, and Kendra will have to play a dangerous game of trust. Does Trooogul intend to help Kendra find the Door to Unger, or will he lead her across the wretched Greeven Wastes, only to betray her to the Unger Elders so that she can be cast into the maze of monsters?  There’s only one way to find out. Slip inside the Door to Unger yourself, and follow Kendra as she embarks on an adventure that will change everything she has come to believe about the Ungers—and herself.

Growing up on the Isle of Wight, he was taught by his father to sail and climb at an early age. Inevitably, it wasn't long before Bear was leading out-of-bounds night-climbing missions at school. As a teenager, he found identity and purpose through both mountaineering and martial arts, which led the young adventurer to the foothills of the mighty Himalaya and a grandmaster's karate training camp in Japan. On returning home, he embarked upon the notoriously gruelling selection course for the British Special Forces to join 21 SAS - a journey that was to push him to the very limits of physical and mental endurance. Then, in a horrific free-fall parachuting accident in Africa, Bear broke his back in three places. It was touch and go whether he would ever walk again. However, only eighteen months later and defying doctors' expectations, Bear became one of the youngest ever climbers to scale Everest, aged only twenty-three. But this was just the beginning of his many extraordinary adventures ... Known and admired by millions - whether from his global adventure TV series, as a bestselling author, or as Chief Scout to the Scouting Association - Bear Grylls has survived where few would dare to go. Now, for the first time, Bear tells the story of his action-packed life. Gripping, moving and wildly exhilarating, ""Mud, Sweat and Tears"" is a must-read for adrenalin junkies and armchair adventurers alike.

The pioneering photojournalist an immigrant from Denmark drew attention to the poverty and evils of slum life in the late 1800s. Riis won national acclaim when his photos illustrated his bestselling book How the Other Half Lives. The book focused on the difficult time immigrants faced as thousands of newcomers flooded into the United States each year. Riis called for reform and hoped to prod government officials to help the poor people who were forced to live under horrible conditions. The impact of Riis  photos came from capturing the poor and homeless as they lived and worked, with the subjects  eyes often staring directly into the camera. The great photographer Ansel Adams called them  magnificent achievements in the field of humanistic photography.  But the reforms that came from Riis  work have not eliminated urban poverty and homelessness, and important work remains to be done.

Now, he turns his attention to unforgettable US presidential assassinations, both fatal and failed. Rediscover some of the most profound attacks that have occurred throughout US history involving the notorious assassinations on Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. But did you also know that Richard Paul Pavlick sought to assassinate President Kennedy in 1960, though at the last minute he suddenly changed his mind? Or, that an unknown assailant desperately tried to murder Lincoln just eight months before his fatal night at Ford's Theatre? In addition, Smith reveals failed murder attempts against such presidents as Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, and most recently, the 2011 attempt against President Barack Obama. With over four hundred highly detailed illustrations, Smith captivates the authenticity of these assassinations (re-creating famous photographs and oral history) while simultaneously demonstrating a creative new medium. Whether a historian or a LEGO(R) enthusiast, readers of all ages will surely be enthralled with Brendan Powell Smith's latest brick creation!
