Whose Place,Lydia Cortes,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL15105629W,/authors/OL3868295A/Lydia_Cortes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Straw Gate Books|Language English|Pages 81,"Product Description    Cortés, the name means courtesy or court and there is royalty in these autobiographical poems. Cortés combs meaning out of her memories with epic style. By turns vulnerable and brash, she plumbs the labyrinth and finds her way back out. Mami, Papi, brother, and sister frame a Puerto Rican/Brooklyn lineage. Cortes often recounts her vignettes in rich, bubbling prose where everyday surroundings are magnified to reveal deep symbolism. Yellow kitchen walls from the past are parsed to impart notions of class, family, community, and spirituality as well as ambition, mystery, and independence. The little girl who believed in the magic power of language grows up. Her multi-lingual abilities flower, juxtaposing matte with sheen in a quest parched for aqua. A few experimental poems may prove to be transitional. They lack the subjectivity that gives Cortes her signature punch. Sexual exploits make for juicy reading and they are penned with masterful wordplay. I lay with Joe... and though he was thorough I thought only about Theo. Cortés was close to the late, great poète maudit Pedro Pietri. Two poems for the Reverend faithfully capture him in all his outsized glory. For those of us lucky enough to have known Pietri, her breath rekindles his spirit. Help me, I can see. Honesty and imagination grapple as Sandy Cisneros meets Charles Bukowski. Lydia Cortés should be on a stamp already. -Jeffrey Cyphers Wright, The Brooklyn Rail-   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This powerful and diverse, this unique collection spans three centuries of poetry in America as poets bare their souls, speak their minds, trace their roots, and proclaim their dreams in the thirty-six poems compiled here. The voices of Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, W. E. B. Dubois, and Gwendolyn Brooks, among others, create an energetic blend of tone and tempo, ardor and awe. From lamentations to celebrations, these poems reveal the ironies of black America, juxtaposing themes of resistance and reconciliation, hope and despair. Each poem is further illuminated with notes, a brief biography of the poet, and stunning visual interpretations. Clinton and Alcorn have created a stirring tribute to these great poets, as well as a remarkable volume that will move any reader.

These poems refer to a kind of knowledge that isn't just sought or gained, but is felt and experienced, known in your heart and in your bones as much as in your mind.  From postcards to portraits, from ancient and modern wars to cosmopolitan cities, wildlife, and even a tiny ornamental skeleton, Robert Peake finds a sharp focus for the bigger picture both far and wide and closer to home. These carefully-controlled and eloquent poems know the subtle and deep consequences from each small gesture; the ripple-effect across each story, the altering of lives and history; the still, quiet centre from which it all begins.

Looking to her mothers letters and diaries, Reichl confronts the painful transition her mother made from a hopeful young woman to an increasingly unhappy older one and realizes the tremendous sacrifices she made to make sure her daughters life would not be as disappointing as her own. Growing up in Cleveland, Miriam Brudno dreamed of becoming a doctor, like her father. But when she announced this, her parents said, Youre no beauty, and its too bad youre such an intellectual. But if you become a doctor, no man will ever marry you. Instead, at twenty, Miriam opened a bookstore, a profession everyone agreed was suitably ladylike. She corresponded with authors all over the world, including philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, political figures such as Max Eastman, and novelists such as Christopher Marlowe. It was the happiest time of her life. Nearly thirty when she finally married, she fulfilled expectations, settled down, left her bookstore behind, and started a family. But conformity came at a tremendous cost. With labor-saving devices to aid in household chores, there was simply not enough to do to fill the days. Miriamand most of her friendswere smart, educated women who were often bored, miserable, and silently rebellious. On what would have been Miriams one hundredth birthday Reichl opens up her mothers diaries for the first time and encounters a whole new woman. This is a person she had never known. In this intimate study Reichl comes to understand the lessons of rebellion, independence, and self-acceptance that her motherthough unable to guide herselfsucceeded in teaching her daughter.

Poetic Amusement,Raymond P.

Hammond’s Poetic Amusement has been passed around underground as a digital file for ten years among those associated with The New York Quarterly. The book escaped formal publication till now due to Hammond’s work schedule and his having to assume control of The New York Quarterly in 2002    after the death of founding editor William Packard.  As provocative today as it was when it was written, what began as Hammond’s observations of the influence of “po’ biz” and writing programs on contemporary American poetry became a timeless treatise on poetry itself. Using his experience with NYQ and devouring many literary critics across the ages from the ancient Greeks to contemporary critics, Hammond examines at once both our current literary environment and the essence of poetry. In seeking to answer the questions “What is poetry?” and “Where does poetry come from?” for himself, he encourages readers to ask those questions for and of themselves as well.  Relevant and accessible to readers and writers of poetry and to those who think they don’t know or want to know what poetry is, Poetic Amusement will anger, elevate and inspire all those who read it.

Selected by G. C. Waldrep:  “Some selves present as halls of mirrors, but for Lisa Sewell, the poetic self—the lyric self, the speaking I—inhabits a hall of texts, a palace of moments in which personal experience resonates literally with someone else’s story. From Murder on the Orient Express to The Anatomy of Melancholy, Little House in the Big Woods to The Corrections, texts become sites against which a speaking self fragments, then constellates again as a sort of negative image through which the exigencies of our historical moment come into sharp focus. In these poems, King Lear and Ellis Island are joined at the spine, Iraq and Wharton’s House of Mirth, New Orleans and Poe’s Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. These lyrics suggest that in the end it may not be literature that haunts our lives, but our lives that haunt the longer, stranger, more oblique life of Literature.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Some terrifying moments are encased in chrysalises of beatific clarity and certainty. . . . These poems lead us as readers to search for answers in ourselves. I am not talking about profundity (though there are numberous profound moments here); in essence, I am speaking about how those simple overlooked glimpses at our common lives tend to rise to the troubled surface of the poetry. . . . Gotera paints the score in brilliant, bold, and brave strokes across an encompassing canvas. . . . A tension through juxtaposition is what Vince Gotera's Dragonfly achieves in a miraculous light that sobers the mind. Characters ease into each other's dreams, taking us along with them, and we are better and more complete because we have humbled ourselves long enough to peer through the eyes of these sojourners.  —Yusef Komunyakaa   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knoff|Language English|Pages 142,"A stunning poetry debut: this meditation on the black female figure throughout time introduces us to a brave and penetrating new voice.  Robin Coste Lewis’s electrifying collection is a triptych that begins and ends with lyric poems considering the roles desire and race play in the construction of the self. The central panel is the title poem, “Voyage of the Sable Venus,” a riveting narrative made up entirely of titles of artworks from ancient times to the present—titles that feature or in some way comment on the black female figure in Western art. Bracketed by Lewis’s autobiographical poems, “Voyage” is a tender and shocking study of the fragmentary mysteries of stereotype, as it juxtaposes our names for things with what we actually see and know. Offering a new understanding of biography and the self, this collection questions just where, historically, do ideas about the black female figure truly begin—five hundred years ago, five thousand, or even longer? And what role has art played in this ancient, often heinous story? From the “Young Black Female Carrying / a Perfume Vase” to a “Little Brown Girl / Girl Standing in a Tree / First Day of Voluntary / School Integration,” this poet adores her culture and the beauty to be found within it. Yet she is also a cultural critic alert to the nuances of race and desire and how they define us all, including herself, as she explores her own sometimes painful history. Lewis’s book is a thrilling aesthetic anthem to the complexity of race—a full embrace of its pleasure and horror, in equal parts.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Taken another way, they both say the whole enterprise of finding truth through the poem is the reddest of herrings; simply the pleasure of the attempt makes it worth the price of admission.”    —H_NGM_N  “Polar is a carefully crafted book, comprised of four coherent sections, united not only in their themes of existential, melting intransigence, but also by the strength of Gibson’s undiluted voice. Although he has more than one trick up his sleeve, there is a pleasing consistency in the way Gibson crafts each line, as well as in the way one plainspoken short line follows another. His signature is the craftsmanlike progression of his clear images—the way that subtle assonance or internal rhyme leads the reader from one image to the next.”    —Slope  “The poems in  are anything but frozen; they reveal themselves and revel in their movement. In figures as elaborate and beautiful as frost, Dobby Gibson reinvents poetic argument, often as surprised and delighted by its own wild and energetic means as it is by its wild and sometimes mordant conclusions.”    —Dean Young “These poems are written by a true poet, someone in love with the world and mad at it too, and they are also written by a very particular poet, Dobby Gibson, who is madly in love with the other mysterious inner world each of us possesses and reveals when no one else is looking. ‘It may be true that everything / has already been said, / but it’s just as true that not everyone / has had a chance to say it.’ How can one not listen to the innards of a young poet who announces as much and then sets out, in his first book, to make it new? One can’t not listen. One must.”    —Mary Ruefle   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He speaks to and for our time, from deep wells of history, with a firm understanding that the present is always an experience of the past.”    —Guy Davenport  “I am awed by the range and depth of this compilation of Michael Mott's poetry. Do you crave lyrics on nature, wry/wise readings of history: the famous, the infamous and the unknown; unflinching examinations of love, death and our pretenses? Those who have read Mott's two most recent books of poetry, the intricate and dark Piero di Cosimo and the brilliant Corday, will recognize the mastery and emotional power that place him firmly among the great poets of this or any other century.”    —Bradley R. Strahan  “The Hebraic premise that ‘words are things’ invests these poems with uncommon power, uncommon trouble, In Woman and the Sea, Michael Mott performs a mystery; his poems attain the surface stillness of finely sculpted artifacts, but with human blood -- and passion, and grief, and surprising joy — coursing through them. From an astonishing range of localities . . . Mr. Mott conducts his permutations of letters, yielding in virtually every case the Presence, if not the Name.”    —Scott Cairns   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As I read I was amazed at the fascinating collection of short poems. They are funny, poignant, irreverent, sexy and wonderful! For more than a year we returned to that book truly getting into to more trouble from more laughing.

His riches destroyed, his family taken, and his own body afflicted. We can only imagine the depth of his loss and pain. Yet as we ponder Job's misery, do we see the threads of God's mercy throughout it? We will all face suffering at some point in our lives; it is inescapable. But what makes calamity endurable is not that God shares our shock, but that through every flame of pain and flood of fear His sovereign goodness sustains us. John Piper's interpretive poem and the stunning photography of Ric Ergrenbright remind your heart of the unshakable fact that God governs all things for His good purposes. Allow your eyes to see life--to see God--in new and powerful ways. And let your spirit rest, knowing that the Lord is not only sovereign, but sweet. - Publisher.

Rapture,Sjohnna McCray,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20048208W,/authors/OL7613033A/Sjohnna_McCray,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 65,"In this award-winning debut, Sjohnna McCray movingly recounts a life born out of wartime to a Korean mother and an American father serving during the Vietnam War. Their troubled histories, and McCray's own, are told with lyric passion and the mythic undercurrents of discovering one's own identity, one's own desires. What emerges is a self- and family portrait of grief and celebration, one that insists on our lives as anything, please, but singular. Rapture is an extraordinary first collection, with poems of rare grace and feeling.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each lesbian has her ways of knowing, her voices, approaches, methodologies, languages. Each lesbian reflects, directly and indirectly, her relations to her own and to other ethnicities, races, social classes, physical abilities, ages, and nationalities. Each lesbian has distinctive perspectives on lesbian existence, friendships and sexualities, separatism and coalition building, theories of knowledge and ethics, language and writing. Lesbian Philosophies and Cultures is a hybrid site for discussion of, work on, and delight in this sometimes uneasy, sometimes painful, sometimes surprising and wonderful, lesbian pluralism.  For this collection, some of the contributors have chosen to write in essay style, and some have chosen to write in fiction, autobiography, poetic prose and experimental forms. The contributors, all of whom live currently in the u.s.a. or quebec, are: Joyce Trebilcot, Vivienne Louise, Kitty Tsui, Ann Ferguson, Julia Penelope, Marthe Rosenfeld, Claudia Card, Anna Lee, Maria Lugones, Edwina Franchild, Caryatis Cardea, Baba Copper, Bette S.

Eran diecinueve estudiantes de pregrado y postgrado de la Universidad de Houston y una profesora acompañante que resultó siendo acompañada. Eran nueve poetas matanceros cuidadosamente elegidos por el editor Alfredo Zaldívar. Era la mejor tradición de Matanzas -la poesía- puesta en manos de traductores jóvenes. Era la agudeza de aquellos -viajeros asombrados- que más que anotar experiencias en sus maltrechos cuadernos escolares, más que alzarse como cronistas de ínsula, devinieron sagaces 59 intérpretes de lo desconocido.""--Page 4 of cover.

The animal at your side,Megan Alpert,poetry,First published in 2020,/works/OL32319891W,/authors/OL11726371A/Megan_Alpert,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Airlie Press|Language English|Pages 69,"Poetry. Jewish Studies. LGBTQIA Studies. The narrators in THE ANIMAL AT YOUR SIDE scavenge for clues, trying to stitch together a life in the midst of unrootedness. Finding bones, talismans, and half-heard voices that portal back to both personal and collective history, the speakers are haunted by diaspora, family estrangement, intergenerational trauma, and resilience. What are the costs of being far away from a homeplace? What are the costs of returning? And when the costs are too high on both sides, how do you choose? Grieving the loss of family of origin, and longing to return, the narrators forge new shapes, grounded in a connection to the natural world, ultimately making a home in their own unsettled natures. These poems play with form and structure, ranging from tightly-wound lyrics to detailed reportage. Alpert uses white space and invents forms as needed, creating sunken stanzas and a poem shaped like a rib cage. By turns gritty, frank, and devotional, THE ANIMAL AT YOUR SIDE finds things to be treasured in weirdness, queerness, the ecstatic, and the erotic. It is a book for anyone who has ever been lost, who has waited for what seemed like too long ""for the voices/to filter back.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dit is 'n versameling (""'n winkel"") van gedigte, maar is terselfdertyd een kunswerk met onderstaande komponente of bewegings wat tot die geheel bydra. Dit word gedeeltelik in kleur uitgegee, het 'n gedig wat in braille gedruk is, 'n gedig wat op papier gebosseer is, 'n gedig met papier wat in konsertinavorm met die hand deur die digter self gevou is, asook verskeie skakels na die skrywer se webwerf waar videogedigte besigtig kan word. Sodoende word die bundel as objek op papier beklemtoon, maar word die bundel ook na die ruimte buite die papier geneem. Nie slegs die teks is dus in Winkel van wanklanke belangrik nie, maar ook die ruimte waarbinne dit geplaas word, hóé die woorde op papier gespasieer is, hoe die gedig vertoon, die effek en sensasie van die letters op papier. Deurlopend word die gedigte vergesel met humoristiese en sardoniese kommentaar, woordspel en fyn humor. Vele gedigte is kodes wat deur die interaktiewe leser ontsyfer moet word, en lei tot verskeie interpretasiemoontlikhede. Winkel van wanklanke is Meyer se debuutbundel en hy skram nie weg daarvan om sowel groot figure in die Afrikaanse digkuns as internasionale kunstenaars soos Jackson Pollock, Picasso en Yves Klein in gesprek te tree nie. Dit is veral 'n konseptuele bundel wat die idee van wat 'n bundel is of kan wees bevraagteken. Dit is nie bloot 'n bundel nie, maar kan as 'n kunsobjek gesien word. Dit word besonder mooi uitgegee en is elkeen afsonderlik met die hand versorg.""--Versindaba description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Working through a long tradition of Zen practice, poetry, and meditative walking, Paul Naylor has wrought poems that feel to your hands and feet like trails twisting around scree and talus. Each step is a carefully crafted philosophy made of words as much as rock. At night the stars wheel so close and mythically overhead you can reach up and touch their sharp edges. How do twenty years pass? What does a coyote or grizzly bear do at night? Where do the dead go? Not Quite Noon gives a hint. --Andrew Schelling""--Publisher's website.

Brown,poetry,First published in 1926,/works/OL7774961W,/authors/OL2441240A/Ruth_A._Brown,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 1926|Publisher  Printed by Newman-Burrows Co., Inc.|Language English|Pages 219","Ruth A. Brown, the director of Camp Fire Girls in Seattle from 1919 through 1926, compiled the favorite poems of her Camp Fire Girls and campers at Camp Sealth.  During the first summer of camp, which was held one what was then called Trimble Island, and now is known as Blake Island, the campers took their turns at tasks in camp.  One major job was doing dishes.  Someone would wash, rinse and dry.  The young girls would recite poetry to pass the time.  Over the years, long after a paid staff began doing dishes, and when camp moved to Vashon Island, the Magic Ring continued to grow.  It was moved from the dish area and to the campfire.  By the 1960's it was common for the Camp Fire Girls, and now boys and girls, to hold a Magic Ring ceremony.  Sometimes a theme would be chosen, but in quiet inspiration, a poem would be said, a song would be sung, each offered spontaneously.  We would sit in thought and then another poem would be read.  What they were read from was each individuals collection of poetry and inspirational songs.  The tradition was to write or type them, and place them in a 3 ring binder - half page size.  Lucky are those who have a copy of Ruth Brown's hard bound book.  There were reprints in 1936 and again in the 60's.  Ruth Brown left Camp Fire to open her own camp in the San Juam Islands, Four Winds.  She died in 1976 and is buried at her beloved Four Winds.

W. Norton|Language English,"Inspired by the gratifying success of The Poet's Companion, Kim Addonizio presents exciting new insights into the creative process, craft, and the lessons of her own creative journey. Poetry's time-honored subjects—love, loss, identity, community—are here, along with a heady variety of writing exercises (and innovative ways to use the Internet). Chapters on gender, race, and class challenge readers to explore their creative vision more deeply.  Addonizio, hailed for her passionate, award-winning poetry, shares her breakthroughs and frustrations frankly, including samples of rejection slips. She offers not only encouragement but also a wealth of knowledge about form and structure, metaphor and rhythm, revision, and that elusive goal: publishing.  ""Poetry is not a means to an end,"" Addonizio maintains, ""but a continuing engagement with being alive."" Her generous guide is for beginners and experienced poets, for groups and in the classroom—indeed for anyone eager to glimpse the angel of poetry.

It is a work that is solid in content, form, and techniques. There are many quotable lines, a measure of poetic strength. I cannot forget the line about the child hearing Koranic recitation from the mother's womb. Also, the moral authority combined with oratory in a wise one who can be heard by a dumb ruler! In addition to the rich Islamic heritage and the success of Ilorin individuals in the areas of justice and bravery, the poet praises the city's delicious trademarked foods such as ""Warankasi,"" ""Tuworesi,"" and ""Gbegiri."" Among the best executed poems are ""Onikepe Aduke Opo"" and ""Why the Sun Has Not Diminished in Light."" Na'Allah has handled the praise poetry form dexterously, and that means ""at times even a critical appraisal of an item of praise."" The reader comes out with a feeling of satisfaction for the poetic effulgence and knowing Ilorin better in its multiple areas of distinction and especially for its multicultural, Islamic, and tolerant character from an Ilorin-born and raised fine poet.

Red Sky: Anthology of Speculative Poetry,E.S. Wynn,poetry,First published in 2014,/works/OL5725972W,/authors/OL7552247A/E.S._Wynn,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37041173M-M.jpg,Publish Date 24 October 2014|Publisher  Createspace Independent Publishing Platform|Language English|Pages 210,"Speculative poetry travels winding roads leading to wondrous worlds, regions never traversed by mainstream verse. Fantastic poems range in the material they treat from the strange but explainable to the utterly fanciful, from horror to wonder, and from the rigidly verisimilitudinous to the purely surrealist. They may utilize traditional prosody or may avail themselves of the discontinuities and fragmentation of modernist free verse. They may use as setting the primary world, a secondary world, or a combination of the two. With roots planted firmly in the mythic and folkloric epics and ballads of yore, and branches reaching high into the endless skies of modern fantasy, science fiction, and horror, speculative poetry is a historic and vital poetic genre, the source of the most thoughtful, imaginative verse being written today.  Red Sky features over 100 years' worth of speculative poetry from yesterday's masters, modern award winners, and emerging stars. Filled with luminous ideas, otherworldly adventures, metaphysical encounters and startling futuristic speculations, these poems will appeal to all readers as they chart the emergence and evolution of speculative poetry.

By doing so, Wong creates a space between--for the reader to enter. At the same time, by creating this space, she makes a space for possibility. For instance, in her poem 'Filed Notes Toward War,' Wong writes 'The war is not over. / The streets are lined with little lamps of snow, / melting. Water pours without end. / There is a swan bathing in my mouth.' Montage-like, the poems are also a kind of philosophy by which I mean they are curious. They ask questions of the world. Not afraid of being earnest, Wong's voice is both playful and cerebral, weaving in and out of the world-- its wars and its violence, poverty and alienation--making a beautiful and smart, strange and new, word elixir.""--Cynthia Cruz, back cover.

Included in this anthology are poems from tutors and teachers, aunts and grandmothers, friends and siblings, and from poets with autism themselves. Most of the work here is by highly accomplished poet-parents of autistic children written in a variety of traditional and experimental forms. But be warned. Much of the work articulates the despair, guilt, anger, as well as the joy that arises from engagement with such a complicated and diverse disability. As the editor Sean Thomas Dougherty writes, “I can only hope the range of these poems teaches you, the reader, what they have taught me, the editor, about my own autistic daughter, about art, and how we can be brought together through language towards love.”  All contributor royalties earned on sales will be donated to Sharing the Weight, a small nonprofit out of Iowa doing a simple amazing thing: gathering people together to hand sew and make weighted blankets for autistic children.

In POSITION PAPER, Carol Snow's project of noting the world in relation comes fully assembled. This New and Selected Poems gathers work from Artist and Model, ""a first book of singular poetic intelligence and attention"" (Michael Palmer), to what Brian Teare called the ""compassionately witty"" karesansui--collages citing Basho, Sappho, Picasso, Groucho--to new work in elegy to the poet's sister consolidating a startling range of means. The art of Henri Matisse, touchstone of invention and ""attention or gratitude, not madness, "" is one motif attending this collection; the stone and sand arrangement of the Zen garden at Ryoan-ji another; not to mention the 70 prepositions the poet memorized in Junior High School. Snow's work has been praised as ""brilliant, funny, subtle"" (Robert Hass), ""delicate, masterful"" (Cole Swenson), and ""a new and mesmerizing way of looking at things"" (Fanny Howe). Stones, art, family, elegy, error, perception, prepositions, permutations, ""likening... like an only hope or home."" The whole, a kind of suite.

What emerges is an infinite series of false endings--each a trap door containing the possibility for alchemy, rebirth, and renewal.

The love here is primarily romantic and rises from ashes through comfort to ecstasy and descending and ascending again and again in the expression of all that he has internalized and investigated. Massman, as in his previous NYQ book, 0.174: The Complete Numbers Cycle, rejects the trends and norms of establishment corporate poetry, intoning, sometimes infernally to conformists, his own unique inimitable productions. For the reader willing to undertake his excesses awaits occasionally a lovely fulfillment.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Carnival, he skates paratactically between states of being: levity, heart-holes, licks of darkness, lovesickness and werewolfishness. Bredle's gift as a poet is to traverse and re-traverse one looking glass in ten different moods. When he goes through it, we are taken. -Melissa Broder""--  ""Steeped in a high-octane mythos, Jason Bredle's Carnival lets every inch of the world surge with delight and sorrow. The result is a collection of poems that thrills by framing an accurate snapshot of the human condition at its most absurd and joyful.

Like candid snapshots, the short poems in this collection create evocative images that bring all our senses into play. Jane confesses that words and their sounds obsess her, and her pleasure in their multiple possibilities is evident in every poem. True to her belief that laughter is our saving grace, she uses flashes of ironic humor as a counterpoint to her darker poems. Above all, like Linda Loman in Death of a Salesman, this poet insists that ""attention must be paid,"" even to the seemingly insignificant, and invites the reader to share the sense of wonder and pleasure she finds in everyday life.

Birds are the central motif and while they often remain themselves, they also evoke the arts and transcendence (flight). The birds are hardy and fragile, persistent yet flighty. They are seekers that embody how humans yearn, pursue, and in spite of splendor along the way, never quite arrive.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The brutality of his murder, the open-casket funeral, and the acquittal of the men tried for the crime drew wide media attention.  Award-winning poet Marilyn Nelson reminds us of the boy whose fate helped spark the civil rights movement. This martyr’s wreath, woven from a little-known but sophisticated form of poetry, challenges us to speak out against modern-day injustices, to “speak what we see.”   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Comprised of two main components, this resource features an annotated bibliography of 198 poetry volumes, and a thematic guide to over 6,000 individual poems. The carefully chosen anthologies and collections span reading levels from sixth to twelfth grade, and a tremendous breath of interest areas. Poets whose works are cited range from the classic to the contemporary, cover a broad ethnic and geographic spectrum, and range in style from humorous to tragic, rap to blues, free verse to rhymes, and limericks to haiku.  This survey of young adult poetry represents a careful selection and evaluation process undertaken by the authors in consultation with classroom teachers. The annotations help users identify themes in the works, grade level appropriateness, as well as format and content in the poetry collections and anthologies. The authors offer helpful suggestions for ways that these poetry works may be used in the English classroom and beyond; for igniting creative sparks with young writers, for science and social studies discussion, counseling sessions, and for sheer enjoyment. Librarians will value this well-organized resource as both a collection development tool, and--with its index of writers and titles and extensive theme guide--as a way of connecting young readers to wonderful poetry.

Arabic|Pages 519,"ديوان القرن الثامن:  التقلبات السياسية تنعش حرب المصنَّفات وتضعف قامة الشعراء د. نضير الخزرجي  تدخل السياسة بوصفها ممارسة بنيوية لإدارة العباد والبلاد، كعامل رئيس أو مساعد في كل مناحي الحياة على المستوى الفردي والمجتمعي، ومظاهرها تعكس قوة المجتمع أو ضعفه، كما تعكس اهتمامات رجالاتها مسار البلد والمجتمع معا، إن خيراً فخيرا وإن شراً فشرا.    وعلى صعيد الأدب، فإنَّ السياسة لها مدخلية أساسية في بيان مؤشر الأدب من قوة أو ضعف، وعلى علاقة مباشرة برجالات الأدب من شعراء وكتاب، فلطالما قرّبت السلطة شاعرا أو كاتبا فبرز من بين أقرانه، ولطالما أبعدت آخرين، فجهل الناس آثارهم، وبشكل عام فإنَّ السياسة وتقلباتها تمغنط بوصلة الأدب، والأدب في الوقت نفسه تبع مؤشر السياسة، فكل منهما يدل على واقع البلد والمجتمع، ولهذا يقوى الأدب وبخاصة النظم في فترة ويضعف في أخرى، وتعلو في كبد السماء شمس شعراء وتكسف شمس آخرين.  • تقلبات سياسية    وفي القرن الثامن الهجري (6/9/1301- 12/9/1398م) حيث شهد قيام وموت العشرات من الدول والإمارات الإسلامية، وبعضها استمر الى ما بعد القرن الثامن، تماما كما كان الواقع المرير في القرن السابع ""الثالث عشر الميلادي""، تعرض أدب نظم القوافي الى ما تعرضت له الدول من صعود وهبوط، ومن ولادة وانقراض، وهذه الملاحظة يدرسها بإسهاب الدكتور الشيخ محمد صادق محمد الكرباسي في كتابه الجديد ""ديوان القرن الثامن"" الخاص بما نظم في الإمام الحسين (ع) من الشعر القريض والصادر عن المركز الحسيني للدراسات بلندن في 520 صفحة من القطع الوزيري، حيث يضع جدولا بـ 23 دولة ودويلة قامت في القرن الثامن الهجري أو قبله مثل الدولة العثمانية، أو انقرضت أو استمرت الى القرن التاسع مثلما هي في الأندلس، أو ما بعد ذلك، وحسب قناعة الشيخ الكرباسي أنَّ القرن الثامن: ""يعد من أكثر القرون التي شهدت تقلبات سياسية في العالم الإسلامي""، ولاحظ أنَّ تسعة من هذه الدول كانت شيعية المذهب والبقية سنية، مما يظهر: ""مدى انتشار فكر مدرسة أهل البيت (ع) الذي كان محجوراً عليه أيام حكومة العباسيين وبسقوطها تحرر الفكر الموالي لأهل البيت (ع) والذي كان المؤمنون به يشكلون الأكثرية بين نهري السند والفرات، وكان من القوة بمكان بحيث خضع المغول لفكرهم فأشركوا العديد منهم في وزاراتهم ثم دانوا للفكرة فيما ليصبح المذهب الرسمي لدولتهم"".    ولما كان الأدب بشكل عام، لصيقا بالنظام السياسي، فإنَّ عدداً غير قليل من الدول في العالم الإسلامي لم تكن بعربية، مثل الدولة الإيلخانية في إيران (649-736هـ)، والدولة البهمنية في الهند (747-933هـ)، والدولة الكركانية (726-911هـ) في أفغانستان، والدولة العثمانية (680-1342هـ) في تركيا، وهذا ما أثر بشكل ملحوظ على النتاجات الأدبية من نظم ونثر، ومع أن إسلامية الدولة يجعلها تهتم باللغة العربية وآدابها لدخول العربية كعنصر أساس في فقه العبادات إضافة الى فقه المعاملات، ناهيك عن عربية القرآن الكريم التي بها يقرأ كل مسلم، لكن الآداب الفارسية والتركية وغيرهما دخلت الى اللغة العربية، وعلى أثر ذلك: ""ظهر اللحن في العديد من النتاجات الأدبية الى جانب السرقات التي ظهرت عند الأدباء لضعف مستواهم الأدبي وكانت هذه الظاهرة أكثر شيوعا في مصر منه في العراق""، وقد ساهم احتكاك المجتمعات وعلى مستوى النظم ظهور الشعر الملمع في القرون الماضية، وفي القرن الثامن برز شعراء عرب ومسلمون ينظمون بأكثر من لغة، مثل الشاعر الإيراني حافظ الشيرازي محمد بن محمد (ت 792هـ) الذي نظم بالعربية والفارسية، فأبدع في الشعر الملمع، ومن ذلك قوله في الهزج:    ألا يا أيها الساقي  أدر كأسا وناولها    كه عشق آسان نمود أول  ولي أفتاد مشكلها    أي ان الحب سهل المراد في أوله ولكن المشاكل تقع فيما بعد.  • كساد الأدب    ولاحظ المصنف من خلال متابعته الدقيقة لدواوين عموم الشعراء في هذا القرن انخفاضا كبيرا في عدد الشعراء: ""يدلنا على كساد سوق الأدب بشكل عام والشعر بشكل خاص""، فضلا عن ظهور كتابات أدبية وثقافية طائفية تدعو الى الاحتراب الداخلي، أي الانتقال من السلاح الأبيض الى السلاح الأسود، من شفرات السيوف ونصول الرماح الى شفرات القصب ونصول الأقلام يحبرون الكلام على أديم الورق، ولعل من مظاهر هذه الحرب تفرّغ الشعراء الى نظم المطولات، من: ""حيث أن النظم كان آنذاك من أفضل الوسائل الإعلامية الناجحة، وحتى يتمكنوا من بيان مرادهم أطالوا في النظم"". ويعتقد الكرباسي إنَّ نظم القصائد الطوال ساهم في استخدام الجناس، بل: ""ولعلنا نستشف من إصرار الشعراء على ذلك بإنَّ الشاعر يريد إبراز قدراته الشعرية في وقت تراجع الأدب وانحسر الشعر بل برز اللحن في اللغة العربية، ولعل هذا يعد جزءاً مسببا في التطويل أيضا"".    ومن معالم هذا الكساد أنَّ هذا الديوان ضم ثلاثة عشر شاعرا فقط، نظموا في الإمام الحسين، برز منهم خمسة فقط وهم وفق حجم الإنتاج الأدبي: الخليعي علي بن عبد العزيز (ت 750 هـ) وله 21 قصيدة ومقطوعة من بين 45 قصيدة ومقطوعة وبيت وردت في ديوان القرن الثامن أي نحو النصف، ويليه الشفهيني علي بن الحسين المتوفى في الربع الأول من القرن الثامن وله سبع قصائد وهي المشهورة بالسبع الطوال، ويليه المرتضى علي بن عبد الحميد الحلي الحائري (ت 760 هـ) وله قصيدتان، ويليه المخزومي الحسن بن راشد (ت حدود 800 هـ) وله قصيدة من 185 بيتا، والخامس هو الشيخ النحي (إبن النح) الحسن بن علي من شعراء هذا القرن وله قصيدة نونية من 42 بيتا وقطعة في قافية الدال.    ووجد المصنف أن عدد الناظمين في مشرق العالم الإسلامي ومغربه تضاءل بصورة كبيرة بحيث بلغ عددهم نحو سبعين ناظما، وأربعين منهم كان شاعرا بلحاظ أنَّ الشاعر أعم من الناظم، وانحسرت مساحة الشعر، وانحصرت في العراق وسوريا ومصر والأندلس، وفي العراق توزعت على مدينتي الحلة وكربلاء، وكما يؤكد المحقق الكرباسي: ""يظهر من مجمل الديوان أن الحلة بالذات كانت في تلك العصور مهبط الأدباء والشعراء الى جانب العلماء"". ومن إفرازات الاحتباس الشعري وانحساره والجزر فيه الاقتصار على أوزان وبحور رائجة دون التوسع في البقية.  • قصّة سلاح  يأخذ السلاح كقطعة حربية وكجهد بشري شهرته تبعا لصانعه أو المدينة التي صنعت فيه، أو المدينة التي تروّج فيها تجارته، فعلى سبيل المثال، فان بندقية الكلاشنكوف (ak 47) أخذت شهرتها من صانعها الروسي ميخائيل كلاشنكوف (mikhail klashinkov) المولود في العام 1919م، والتي صنعها في العام 1947م، أو قنبلة كوكتيل مولوتوف الحارقة، نسبة الى وزير خارجية الاتحاد السوفيتي في عهد جوزيف ستالين (1879-1953م) فاياشسلاف مولوتوف (vyacheslav molotov) (م1890-1986) الذي أمر باستعمالها أثناء الحرب العالمية الثانية لمواجهة الدبابات الألمانية، ثم شاع استعمالها في حوادث الشغب.    وقطع الأسلحة القديمة على بساطتها نظرا لعالم اليوم، فإنها ه? الأخرى لها شهرتها وصيتها في المعارك، ولطالما تغنى بها الشعراء عودا على المدينة الصناعية أو الى مهارة صانع، كما هو الأمر في عالم اليوم، حيث تفتخر الدول بصناعاتها العسكرية وتسوق لها في معارض سنوية، ومن ذلك قول الشاعر علي بن عبد الحميد الحلي الحائري يقول في قصيدة من 104 أبيات من الطويل في وصف بطولة الإمام الحسين (ع) :    يفرون كالمعزى إذا شدّ نحوهم  أبو أشبُلٍ عبلُ الذراع مُبيرُ    إذا ما سطا شاهدتَ هاماً مُفلّقاً  وأيدٍ من الضرب الدّراك تطيرُ    يخطُّ بخَطِّيِّ القنا في ظهورهم  خُطوطا لها وقعُ السيوفِ سطورُ    والشاهد في (خَطِّيِّ) وهو الرمح المنسوب الى الخط، وهو مرفأ للسفن بالبحرين حيث تباع الرماح، وهي من الرماح الجيدة التي يفتخر المقاتل تملكه لها.    ومثله قول علي بن الحسين الشفهيني في قصيدة من البسيط في 71 بيتا في وصف معركة كربلاء عام 61 هـ، فينشد:    آهاً على حسرةٍ في كلّ جانحةٍ  ما عشتُ جائحةٌ تعلو لها شُعَلُ    أيقتلُ السبطُ ظمآناً ومن دَمه  تروى الصوارم والخطِّيَّةُ الذُبُلُ    أو قول الشاعر حسن المخزومي، في قصيدة من الطويل في 185 بيتا في وصف معركة كربلاء يشير الى احد أنواع السيوف الشهيرة، وهو ينشد في بطولات الإمام الحسين (ع):    فجدَّلَ من فوق الجياد جِيادَها  فَحيلٌ وقومٌ جافلٌ وقتيلُ    فكم جافلٍ في صدره ظَهرُ ذابلٍ  وكم قاتلٍٍ بالمَشرَفيِّ قتيلُ    وموضع الشاهد في (المشرفي) وهو نوع من أنواع السلاح الفائقة الجودة (السيف) وتنسب الى إحدى قرى اليمن، وقيل نسبة الى قرى مشارف الشام.    أو قول الشاعر الخليعي علي بن عبد العزيز في قصيدة من البسيط في 44 بيتا، يصف واقعة الطف بكربلاء ، فينشد:    واحسرتا لكريم السبط مُشتهراً  كالبدر يشرقُ فوقَ الذابلِ اليَزَني    فيا لها محنةٌ عمَّت مُصيبتُها  ويا لها حسرةٌ في قلبِ ذي شَجَنِ    يُهدى يزيدُ برأسٍ طال ما رشَفَ الـ  ـمختارُ من ثغرهِ تقبيل َمُفتَتِنِ    فالشاعر يبدي حسرة وأسفا على حز رأس الإمام الحسين (ع) ثم رفعه فوق رمح يزني، مع أن هذا الرأس كان النبي محمد (ص) يقبل ثغره ويرشف رضابه. وموضع الشاهد هو الرمح اليزني نسبة الى ""ذو اليزن"" وهو من ملوك حِميَر في اليمن.  • على قارعة الطريق    لا تخلو قصيدة أو قطعة أو بيت شعر من غرض أو شأن دفعت الشاعر الى الإنشاء والإنشاد، بخاصة وأنَّ الشعر الحقيقي ما عبر عن شعور داخلي وفيض إحساس، ومن ذلك قول الشاعر الخليعي علي بن عبد العزيز من الوافر:    إذا شئت النجاةَ فزُر حُسيناً  لكي تلقى الإلهَ قريرَ عينِ    فإن النارَ ليسَ تمسُّ جِسماً  عَلَيه غُبارُ زُوّارُ الحُسينِ    والخليعي ولد لأمٍّ موصلية طاف بها سني الحمل، وقد تملّكها الشيطان من قبل فبغضت أهل البيت (ع)، فنذرت إن هي رُزقت بولد أن ترسله الى كربلاء المقدسة يقطع على زوار الإمام الحسين (ع) الطريق فيسلبهم متاعهم ويقتلهم، فلما تحقق نذرها وكبر ولدها علي، أغرته بما نوت عليه، فقدم الى كربلاء، ولما وصل مدينة المسيب على نحو 35 كيلومترا من كربلاء تربص بقوافل الزوار دوائر السوء، لكن النوم استولى عليه واجتازت عليه قافلة الزوار فأصابه منها غبارها المتصاعد، فرأى وهو في النوم أن القيامة قد حانت وسيق الى النار، لكن النار صارت له بردا وسلاما بفعل غبار ركب زوار الإمام الحسين (ع)، ولما أفاق آب الى رشده، فأخذ طريقه الى مرقد الإمام الحسين (ع) وهو يترنم بهذين البيتين، ولما وقف أمام القبر الشريف راح ينشد الإمام بقصيدة عصماء، وهو في الأثناء وقع عليه ستار من الباب الشريف فلقب بالخليعي أو الخلعي فصار يفتخر بذلك ويختم به قصائده الحسينية. ومن يومه انقطع الخليعي الى حب أهل البيت (ع)، وترجم ذلك الحب بعشرات القصائد الطوال وصلنا منها (39) قصيدة عشرون خاصة بالإمام الحسين (ع) إضافة الى البيتين.    ومن المفارقات أنَّ زمن قطع الطرق على زوار الامام الحسين (ع) عاد من جديد مطلع الألفية الثالثة مع تبدل النظام الحاكم في العراق منذ العام 2003م، وعاد الى المنطقة نفسها والقريبة منها بشراسة أكبر، واعتقد أنَّ الكثير ممن يشرّع قتل الزائر الحسيني سيقفل راجعاً عما عليه من الجرم الكبير لو أعاد قراءة سيرة الخليعي بقلب سليم.    وما يميز قصائد الخليعي أنَّ كل قصيدة تروي ملحمة كربلاء من أولها الى آخرها قبل المعركة وأثنائها وفي الأسر، وحسب تقييم الدكتور الكرباسي إنَّ شعر الخليعي: ""كله نابع عن إيمان صادق بشخصية الإمام الحسين (ع) وقد ملأ كيانه بالولاء، وشعره وجداني قوي التعبير وكأنه لا يريد أن يدع جانبا من مأساة عام إحدى وستين التي نزلت على الإمام الحسين (ع) وأهل بيته إلا ويشجو له من كل قلبه ويتفاعل مع المأساة وكأنه حضرها وعايشها، وشعره الحسيني يبلغ سبعمائة وأربع وخمسين بيتاً يصلح لأن يكون لوحده ملحمة شعرية حسينية رائعة التصوير لأحداث الطف الحزينة"".    وربما لخلفية والديه، فان كل استشهاداته في فضائل أهل البيت أرجعها الى الآيات والأحاديث المتواترة والصحيحة: ""لحرصه على إسناد حسن اختياره بالدليل ليقطع الطريق على من ليسوا على عقيدته"".    ومن شعره في قصيدة من البسيط:    ولست آسى على مَن ظلَّ يُبعِدُني  بالقُرب منكم ومَن بالغيب يرجُمُني    وإنني واثقٌ أن سوف يلطُفُ بي  ربيّ فيصفحُ عن جُرمي ويَرحمُني    وأن فاطمةَ الزهراءَ تشفَع لي  والمُرتضى لِجِنان الخُلد يقسِمُني    فاز الخليعيُّ كلَّ الفَوزِ واتضَّحَت  بِكُم له سُبُلُ الإرشادِ والسُّنَنِ  • المراسل الحربي    يظن البعض أنه لما كانت الصحافة والإعلام بالصورة التي نجدها اليوم من مذياع وتلفاز وفضائيات وانترنيت جديدة على البشرية، فان المراسل الصحافي بعامة والحربي بخاصة، إنما هي مهنة انبثقت مع ظهور الوسائل الإعلامية، بيد أنَّ معركة كربلاء في العام 61هـ، تضعف من هذا القول، فالمراسل الحربي الذي نجده اليوم من على شاشات التلفاز بيده المذياع ومتدرعا بصدرية إعلامية تدل عليه، ينقل وقائع معركة هنا وحربا هناك دون أنْ يتعرض له طرفا النزاع أو القتال بأذى مقصود، إنما هي ظاهرة ممتدة في عمق التاريخ البشري، حيث تبانَ أطراف كل نزاع على تسهيل مهمته لنقل الوقائع والحوادث بحرية ومن قلب المعركة والنزاع.    وفي معركة كربلاء كانت شخصية حميد بن مسلم الأزدي تمثل ذلك المراسل الحربي الذي يتنقل بين جبهتي القتال يرصد حركة الجيشين، فيسجل واقعة هنا وحدثا هناك، وتؤخذ روايته على محمل الجد والصدق بوصفها رواية شاهد عيان أتاحت له مهنته نقل الوقائع بما رأى وسمع في آن واحد. ويتكرر ذكر حميد بن مسلم في نقل وقائع حركة التوابين في العام 65 هـ التي قادها سليمان بن صرد الخزاعي بالضد من الحكم الأموي ثأراً لشهداء كربلاء، كما يتكرر ذكره في نقل أخبار حركة المختار بن أبي عبيد بن مسعود الثقفي في العام 66 هـ بالضد من الحكم الأموي وإقامة دولته في الكوفة حتى العام 67 هـ.    ومع أن وقعة الطف لم تنقل كلها عن طريق حميد بن مسلم الأزدي (ت بعد 75هـ)، لكنّ تسجيله للحظات حساسة من مسلسل المعركة وبخاصة لحظة استشهاد الإمام الحسين (ع) جعلته في مقدمة الرواة والمراسلين الحربيين، وهذا ما يسجله الشاعر علي الشفهيني في لاميته من البسيط في 71 بيتا في مدح الإمام علي (ع) ثم يعرج على رثاء الإمام الحسين (ع)، في قصيدة ومطلعها:    حلَّت عليك عقود المزن يا حللُ  وصافحتك أكفّ الطل يا طلَلُ    ثم يقول:    وقد رواه حميدٌ نجلُ مسلمَ ذو الـ  ـالصدوق وصدقُ القولِ مُمتَثَلُ    إذ قال لم أَرَ مكثوراً عشيرتُهُ  صرعى فمُنعَفِرٌ منهم ومُنجَدِلُ    يوماً بأربطَ جأشاً من حُسين وقد  حفَّت به البيضُ واحتاطت به الأسَلُ    كأنما قسورٌ ألوى على حُمُرٍ  عَطفاً فخامَرها من بأسِه ذَهَلُ    فالشفهيني يروي عن حميد بن مسلم مشاهدته للإمام الحسين (ع) عندما وقف وحيدا في المعركة بلا ناصر ولا معين يواجه جيش الشام بمفرده، ونص القول: ""ما رأيت مكثوراً قط قد قُتل وُلده وأهل بيته وصحبه أربط جأشا منه ولا أمضى جناناً، ولا أجرأ مقدماً، ولقد كانت الرجال تنكشف بين يديه إذا شدّ فيها ولم يثبت له أحد""(مقتل الحسين للمقرم: 275)، وفي بعض المصادر ان القائل هو عبد الله بن عمار بن يغوث.    فهذه شهادة من شاعر في القرن الثامن الهجري يثني فيها على مراسل حربي في القرن الأول، حيث يقف الإثنان على منصة الإعلام، فالأول ينقل الحدث كمادة خام والثاني يشرع بسفينة حسه الشعري وسط بحوره لمعاملة المادة النثرية بكيمياء القوافي، فيصل الى الساحل الآخر وفي كفه جوهرة موزونة.  • مفارقات الدهر!    يرصد الشاعر كأي مراقب حصيف تناقضات الحياة ويتابع مفارقات الدهر، فيتمثلها في قصائده ويضمنها أبيات شعره، ليتناقلها الناس جيلا بعد آخر، ويتعظ بها من يتعظ، فهذا الشاعر علي بن المظفر الوداعي (ت 716 هـ)، ينشد من الكامل:    عَجباً لمن قَتل الحسين وأهلَه  حرّى الجوانحِ يومَ عاشوراءِ    أعطاهُمُ الدنيا أبوهُ وجَدُّهُ  وعليه قد بَخِلوا بِشربةِ ماءِ    فهو يحلق بنا في أجواء مدرستين وخُلقين وحزبين متضادين، وحسبما يعلق الشيخ الكرباسي: ""ما أروعه من بيت، ولله در قائله، فقد بيّن عنصر الفريقين وسجيته، وكل إناء بالذي فيه ينضح. وإنما أعطاهم الدنيا بأن ملكوا أمور الناس بدين جده رسول الله (ص) وأقام هذا الدين سيف أبيه علي بن أبي طالب (ع)"".    وهذا الشاعر حسن المخزومي، ينشد من الطويل في وصف معركة الطف وما بعدها:    بنو الوحي في أرض الطفوف حواسراً  وأبناءُ حربٍ في الديار نزولُ    ويُسرى بزَين العابدينَ مُقيّداً  على البُزلِ مأسورَ اللِّئام عليلُ    ويُصبحُ في تختِ الخلافةِ جالساً  يزيدُ وفي الطف الحسينُ قتيل    فالشاعر يظهر أسى كبيرا من هذا الزمان الذي يقتل فيه سيد شباب أهل الجنة، وتقاد نساء أهل البيت (ع) والسجاد علي بن الحسين (ع) أسرى الى يزيد حفيد أبي سفيان الذي عامله جد الحسين (ع) النبي الأكرم محمد (ص) معاملة حسنة عندما دخل مكة عام 8 هـ، وقال له ولأهل مكة الذين أذاقوا المسلمين مر العذاب ""اذهبوا فأنتم الطلقاء"" وأغدق عليهم من عطاياه!    ومثل هذا الأسى ينضح من بين ثنايا قوافي الشاعر الشفهيني، الذي يقول في قصيدة من الكامل في 29 بيتا، في مدح الأمام علي (ع) ثم يعرج على ابنه الإمام الحسين (ع) ومطلعها:    نمّ العذار بعارضيه وسلسلا  وتضمنت تلك المراشف سلسلا    الى أن يقول:    ومن العجائب أن تُقاد اُسودُها  أسرى وتفترسُ الكلابُ الأشبُلا    نعم إنها من مفارقات الدهر الذي يريك عجبا ما عشت!  • دعوة حق    والى جانب الشعراء الذين ورد ذكرهم، فقد ضم الديوان قصائد للشعراء: أحمد بن عبد الملك العزّازي (ت 710)، أحمد بن محمد الفيومي (ت 771 هـ)، صفي الدين الحلي عبد العزيز بن سرايا (ت 752 هـ) عمر بن مظفر المعري (ت 749 هـ) محمد بن أحمد الغرناطي (ت 760 هـ) محمد بن أحمد الهواري (ت 780 هـ)، والشاعر محمد بن موسى الصريحي (ت 795 هـ).    وأنهى المحقق الكرباسي ديوان القرن الثامن كما في الدواوين السابقة بمجموعة فهارس قيّمة تهدي القارئ الى المعلومة الواردة طي الكتاب، فيتابع من خلال فهارس المتن: فهرس الأعلام والشخصيات، القبائل والأنساب والجماعات، القوافي والروي، والبحور والأوزان. ويتابع في فهارس الهامش: فهرس الأبيات وأنصافها، التأريخ، الناظمين والشعراء، الأعلام والشخصيات، القبائل والأنساب والجماعات، والفهرس اللغوي. وفي الفهارس المشتركة بين المتن والهامش، يتابع: فهرس الآيات، الأحاديث والأخبار، الأمثال والحكم، مصطلحات الشريعة، المصطلحات العلمية والفنية، الطوائف والملل، الوظائف والرتب، الآلات والأدوات، الإنسان ومتعلقاته، الحيوان ومتعلقاته، النبات ومستحضراته، الفضاء ومتعلقاته، الأرض ومتعلقاتها، المعادن، الأماكن والبقاع، الزمان، الوقائع والأحداث، المؤلفات والمصنفات، المصادر والمراجع، ومؤلفي المراجع.    وفي نهاية الديوان قراءة نقدية بقلم أستاذ علم الرياضيات في كلية ساوثمبتون (southampton college) البروفيسور أحمد أنيو بلانيك (anjo belanjek) البريطاني الجنسية الذي اختار الإسلام معتقدا، حيث يقول في قراءته باللغة الدولية (الإسبرنتو): ""من هذا المؤلف الكبير، قام الشيخ الكرباسي باستعراض تاريخ القضية الحسينية استعراضا واسعا بمجمل تفاصيلها المتفرعة عنها بأسلوب أكاديمي""، وكان من تقييم بلانيك أن ديوان القرن الثامن: ""بمجمله دموع على المأساة وإدانة للطغاة ودعوة للوقوف بوجه العدوان في كل مكان وزمان"".  السبت 21/7/2007م          6/7/1428هـ   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

First in the series was Pictures of the Gone World-the only book of his own poems that Ferlinghetti would ever publish at City Lights. Within a year, he had brought out two more volumes, translations by Kenneth Rexroth and then poems by Kenneth Patchen. But it was the success and scandal of number four, Howl & Other Poems by Allen Ginsberg (1956), that put City Lights on the map, positioning the Pocket Poets Series at the forefront of the literary counterculture. A landmark sixtieth anniversary retrospective, this edition is a must-have collection, an invaluable distillation of the energetic, iconoclastic, and still fresh body of work represented in the ongoing series. Ferlinghetti has selected a handful of poems from each of the sixty volumes, including the work of Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Andrei Voznesensky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Julio Cortázar, Frank O'Hara, Marie Ponsot, Denise Levertov, Diane di Prima, Robert Duncan, Phillip Lamantia, Malcolm Lowry, and many more of the Pocket Poets Series innovative, influential, and often groundbreaking American and international poets.

These fifteen years of poetry forged in the heat of the Chicano Movement (a period Salinas spent, in part, in prison) reveal the growing politicization of intelligent and talented minority convicts incarcerated at a time when their communities were marching forward. As with Ricardo Sanchez and Jimmy Santiago Baca, prison bars were not strong enough to limit Salinas's highly lyric, even rhapsodic calls for liberation -- poems inspired by jazz, the Beat writers, nature, and political skirmishes.  Un Trip through the Mind Jail will stand for generations as a seminal text of Chicano and U. S. minority literature.  via GoogleBooks   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Bewusst wird außerdem so manch Denkgewohntes infrage gestellt; denn der Tod kennt keine Konfession und keine Überzeugungen.  ""Requiem – Fortwährende Wandlung"" fokussiert primär den Charakter des Veränderlichen allen Lebens – sei es menschlich, tierisch oder pflanzlich. Denn es sind unzählige Wandlungen, die alles Dasein in seiner Gesamtheit prägen, bevor das Sterben als letzte große Wandlung beginnt. Die finale Metamorphose ist jedoch der Tod. Ebenso im Mittelpunkt steht die Frage des Umgangs mit dieser Unausweichlichkeit: Geboren, um zu sterben – will man es auf den Punkt bringen. Darin schwingt jedoch auch implizit die Reflexion des ""Wie leben? "" mit – wie leben, damit die Zeit der Metamorphose aus unserer Sicht ""gut"" genannt werden kann, und was hinterlassen wir allem Danach.  ""Requiem – Fortwährende Wandlung"" wurde im Mai 2017 in der Pfarrkirche in Gaubitsch (NÖ) als Liturgische Feier unter Anwesenheit des Pfarrers Christian Wiesinger von den drei AutorInnen Marlen Schachinger, Michael Stavaric und Markus Orths uraufgeführt und liegt nun als Buch im Septime Verlag vor.

The ancient Norse rune of awakening, Dagaz, symbolizes this potential for transformation.  For seekers of meaning, reward, and flow in modern-day life, the poetry within Dagaz hails an awakening to our light-filled spiritual essence and the metamorphosis arising from it. This collection of haiku – each paired with a whisper of insight – explores love, unity, belief, peace, release, change, surrender, inspiration, perception, self-empowerment, and how we shape our world.  A book to return to over a lifetime, Dagaz shines most brilliantly when taken slowly, each poem punctuated by contemplation in the fresh air of awareness and hope.
