A chance encounter leads her to a haiku group, where she discovers poetry that anyone can enjoy writing. Her teacher and fellow haiku group members instruct her in seasonal flora and fauna, and gradually she learns to describe the world in plain words, becoming one of the millions in Japan who lead a haiku life. This is the author's story of her literary and cultural voyage, and more: it is an invitation to readers to form their own neighborhood haiku groups and, like her, learn to see the world anew.

Victorian poetry now,Valentine Cunningham,poetry,First published in 2011,/works/OL16212233W,/authors/OL716847A/Valentine_Cunningham,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Wiley-Blackwell|Language English,"""Poised on the brink of modernism and the twentieth century, the Victorian era was the most productive period of poetry there has ever been, in any language. This book is the definitive guide to the range of Victorian poets and poems, from the famous to the less well known. Approaching the poets and poems in the light of both Victorian and modern critical concerns, this absorbing book places poetry written during the nineteenth century in its personal, aesthetic, historical, and ideological contexts, and considers the poets' major anxieties, such as self, body, and melancholy. The author insists that rhyming and repetition are the major formal features of this (or any) poetry and focuses on the Victorian obsession with small subjects in small poems. The Victorians, at the helm of a global empire, were innovative and ambitious, and the poetry of the age reflects the aspirations and self-consciousness of Victorian society. Esteemed critic, Valentine Cunningham, exhibits encyclopedic knowledge of the poetry produced in this period and, with dazzling close readings of a number of poems, cuts through the often complex Victorian poetic form to reveal the key themes and contexts of the poems and the passions that drove the men and women who wrote them""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I want to linger longer with the poems of David Cavanagh, Theodore Deppe, Melanie Frances and Michael Heffernan.  I want to hear Rory Brennan tell me about a placewhere On past / The smart new housing for the unemployed the diesels / Churn and hiss, trailing a dragon tang out to / The crane-forested docks and the ferry’s leviathan jaw. Want Heffernan to keep on describing a gray abyss the lacy disks / of the wild carrot where my peppers were / stir into spots of incandescent white / between the river meadow and my eyes. Hope to again hear the voice of Richard Tillinghast, much as it begins “A Quiet Pint in Kinvara”: Salt-stung, rain-cleared air, deepened as always / By a smudge of turf smoke. Overhead the white glide / Of seagulls, and in the convent beeches above the road, / Hoarse croak of rooks, throaty chatter of jackdaws.

I have a huge collection of old books, all of which contain hidden gems, this little book, only 159 pages, is 159 pages of little gems from the wonderful William Allingham to W.B. Yeats himself. Of course if you have Allingham you have got to have Alfred Noyes, I think I have every poem of these two valuable assets to reading. The other day I had a wonderful comment about some of my old additions, mainly ones from the 19th century and wow what a great feeling. It is wonderful to have these sites where the world can read what has been gifted to us for centuries.  Great  help was given by Katharine Tynan another great writer, who contributed the first poem to this anthology with DAFFODIL, my garden is full of daffodils and being Welsh myself it is a beautiful poem.

Die Todesfälle liegen Jahrzehnte auseinander, doch es ist der gleiche Todestag: der 16. Januar. Im Winter 1912 ertrank Georg Heym beim Schlittschuhlaufen, 1995 werden die Novizen einer elitären Schauspielschule im gerade wiedervereinten Berlin auf sein verrätseltes Faust-Fragment angesetzt. Angestachelt von ihrem Professor verstricken sie sich immer tiefer in den Gedankenlabyrinthen des genialischen Dichters. Der psychologische Druck steigt, Konkurrenz entflammt, Wahn und Wirklichkeit beginnen zu verschwimmen. Dann wird ein Toter auf der Probebühne der Schule gefunden. War es Mord, Selbstmord - oder doch ein Teufelspakt?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Taking up the subject of divorce and the splintering and re-forming of family that follows it, Zarin, whose work has been compared to that of Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, addresses the passage through a time of guilt and sorrow in an oblique yet precise tone that is unique in contemporary poetry. At the book’s center is a powerful sequence of love poems, in which she asks, “Is it light on the trees / that turns them to pale fire / or is it spring, come without / warning to this town on / stilts . . . ?” Whether taking a brood of children to the swimming pool, contemplating a parrot, or imagining a temperate landscape “where Orion / could shoot the bear along the river, and miss, and miss,” Zarin continually reveals beauty in subtle statements of feeling.  The Watercourse is a gorgeous, mature, and profoundly moving collection.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

""Cecilia Woloch's Sacrifice is an extraordinary debut. These powerful, tender, and compelling poems introduce us to a family album of marvelous and charming figures. And, in the poet's romance of the family, the intoxicating presence of the father is its profound center of gravity. Yet the poet's reverence and affection for the idea of family is inevitably troubled, we discover in later poems, by the unravelling of a marriage... Woloch's poems unveil the wreckage of love after what has been sacramental turns sacrificial. Her poems are by turns reverential, devotional and incantatory--they are prayers spoken to, and on behalf of, a difficult world"" —David St. John.

Rather than discuss the history, the politics, or the theology surrounding Jesus of Nazareth, these poems enter into the human experiences of what it might have been like to walk side-by-side on the dusty roads to Emmaus, Jericho, or Jerusalem, feeling the heat of the day while hearing what this man has to say and watching him perform simple acts of kindness as well as miracles that confounded, confused, and inspired those around him. As you read these poems, you'll also see the struggle the apostles and others felt as they tried to determine just who was this man. Enter into their amazement, hope, despair, and more as they fall in love with a man who gives them hope for a better way to live and for a better world. Enter into the minds, too, of those who opposed and betrayed him to see their struggle. Finally, read these poems as a way to connect your own humanity to Jesus' humanity, in part, to transform him from icon to flesh and blood""--Back cover.

Pure Act tells the story of poet Robert Lax, whose quest to live a true life as both an artist and a spiritual seeker inspired Thomas Merton, Jack Kerouac, William Maxwell and a host of other writers, artists and ordinary people. Known in the U.S. primarily as Merton's best friend and in Europe as a daringly original avant-garde poet, Lax left behind a promising New York writing career to travel with a circus, live among immigrants in post-war Marseilles and settle on a series of remote Greek islands where he learned and recorded the simple wisdom of the local people. Born a Jew, he became a Catholic and found the authentic community he sought in Greek Orthodox fishermen and sponge divers. In his early life, as he alternated working at the New Yorker, writing screenplays in Hollywood and editing a Paris literary journal with studying philosophy, serving the poor in Harlem and living in a sanctuary high in the French Alps, Lax pursued an approach to life he called pure act--a way of living in the moment that was both spontaneous and practiced, God-inspired and self-chosen. By devoting himself to simplicity, poverty and prayer, he expanded his capacity for peace, joy and love while producing distinctive poetry of such stark beauty critics called him ""one of America's greatest experimental poets"" and ""one of the new 'saints' of the avant-garde."" Written by a writer who met Lax in Greece when he was a young seeker himself and visited him regularly over fifteen years, Pure Act is an intimate look at an extraordinary but little-known life. Much more than just a biography, it's a tale of adventure, an exploration of friendship, an anthology of wisdom, and a testament to the liberating power of living an uncommon life""--  ""A biography of experimental poet and spiritual seeker Robert Lax, who inspired Thomas Merton, Jack Kerouac and many others. Using information and stories drawn from journal entries, letters, interviews and the author's personal recollections, the book chronicles the development of Lax's distinctive poetic style and a spontaneous, spiritual approach to life he called pure act""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In The Back Chamber, Donald Hall illuminates the evocative, iconic objects of deep memory--""a cowbell,"" ""a white stone perfectly round,"" ""a three-legged milking stool""--that serve to foreground the rich meditations on time and mortality that run through his remarkable new collection. While Hall's devoted readers will recognize many of his long-standing preoccupations--baseball, the family farm, love, sex, and friendship--what will strike them as new is the fierce, pitiless poignancy he reveals as his own life's end comes into view. The Back Chamber is far from being death-haunted but rather is lively, irreverent, sexy, hilarious, ironic, and sly--full of the life-affirming energy that has made Donald Hall one of America's most popular and enduring poets""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"The essential haiku: versions of Bashō, Buson, and Issa",Robert Hass,poetry,First published in 1994,/works/OL17324740W?edition=ia%3Aessentialhaikuve0000unse,/authors/OL281062A/Robert_Hass,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1428751M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1994|Publisher  Ecco Press|Language English|Pages 329,"The Essential Haiku brings together Robert Hass s beautifully fresh translations of the three great masters of the Japanese haiku tradition: Matsuo Basho (1644-94), the ascetic and seeker, and the haiku poet most familiar to English readers; Yosa Buson (1716-83), the artist, a painter renowned for his visually expressive poetry; and Kobayashi Issa (1763-1827), the humanist, whose haiku are known for their poignant or ironic wit. Each haiku master s section of the book is prefaced with an eloquent and informative introduction by Robert Hass, followed by a selection of over 100 poems and then by other poetry or prose by the poet, including journals and nature writing. Opening with Hass s superb introductory essay on haiku, the book concludes with a section devoted to Basho s writings and conversations on poetry. The seventeen-syllable haiku form is rooted in a Japanese tradition of close observation of nature, of making poetry from subtle suggestion. Each haiku is a meditation, a centring, a crystalline moment of realisation. Reading them has a way of bringing about calm and peace within the reader. The symbolism of the seasons and the Japanese habit of mind blend together in these poems to create an alchemy of reflection that is unsurpassed in literature. Infused by its great practitioners with the spirit of Zen Buddhism, the haiku served as an example of the power of direct observation to the first generation of American modernist poets like Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams as well as an example of spontaneity and Zen alertness to the new poets of post-war America and Britain. Universal in its appeal, Robert Hass s The Essential Haiku is the definitive introduction to haiku and its greatest poets, and has been a bestseller in America for twenty years. I know that for years I didn t see how deeply personal these poems were or, to say it another way, how much they have the flavour - Basho might have said the scent - of particular human life, because I had been told and wanted to believe that haiku were never subjective. I think it was D.H. Lawrence who said the soul can get to heaven in one leap but that, if it does, it leaves a demon in its place. Better to sink down through the level of these poems - their attention to the year, their ideas about it, the particular human consciousness the poems reflect, Basho s profound loneliness and sense of suffering, Buson s evenness of temper, his love for the materials of art and for the colour and shape of things, Issa s pathos and comedy and anger - Robert Hass.

Find the answers, solve the crime. But the Quantico-trained forensic investigator is finding her skills aren't enough when a ferociously intelligent killer strikes Dublin. Themodus operandi is as perplexing as it is macabre. What connects the two seemingly disparate, high-profile victims?

The police are just as frustrated by the crimes' impenetrable nature and it's only when a third murder occurs--equally graphic and elaborate in its execution--that they discover that this particular killer is using a very specific blueprint for his crimes. Who is the killer's next victim, the real target? And what's his endgame?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It draws on animal lore, animal encounters (with grey wolf and manatee), dreams, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and Buddhist ritual to render a text of remarkable sympathy, reciprocity, and power. The poem asks questions as well as urges further engagement with the endangered (including our human selves). Part performance litany, part survival kit, part worried mammalian soundings, Waldman explores, as ever, what it means to inhabit our condition through language and imagination inside a wheel of time. This is the mature work of a philosophical field poet with a shamanic metabolism.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Eliot's masterpiece, and is not only one of the key works of modernism but also one of the greatest poetic achievements of the twentieth century.  A richly allusive pilgrimage of spiritual and psychological torment and redemption, Eliot's poem exerted a revolutionary influence on his contemporaries, summoning forth a rich new poetic language, breaking decisively with Romantic and Victorian poetic traditions.  Kenneth Rexroth was not alone in calling Eliot ""the representative poet of the time, for the same reason that Shakespeare and Pope were of theirs.  He articulated the mind of an epoch in words that seemed its most natural expression.""As influential as his verse, T.S. Eliot's criticism also exerted a transformative effect on twentieth-century letter, and this new edition of The Waste Land and Other Writings includes a selection of Eliot's most important essays. In her new Introduction, Mary Karr dispels some of the myths of the great poem's inaccessibility and sheds fresh light on the ways in which ""The Waste Land"" illuminates contemporary experience.From the Hardcover edition.

Cantos populares de mi tierra,Candelario Obeso,poetry,First published in 1950,/works/OL5879915W,/authors/OL1449272A/Candelario_Obeso,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Alcaldía Mayor de Bogotá, Instituto Distrital de Cultura y Turismo, Observatorio de Cultura Urbana,              Fundación Cultural y Ambiental Candelario Obeso|Language Spanish|Pages 115","A mediados de 1877, en Bogota, Obeso publico en un pequeno y sencillo volumen sus Cantos populares de mi tierra, con un prologo titulado “Dos palabras”, escrito por Venancio Gonzalez Manrique, erudito en lenguas antiguas y modernas y autor de varias obras didacticas. La obra consta de dieciseis poesias y de una version en prosa. De las catorce composiciones que llevan dedicatoria, trece estan dirigidas a escritores e intelectuales o amigos distinguidos del poeta y la otra, a una mujer identificada solamente con las iniciales S. G. L.La obra de Candelario Obeso se enmarca en lo que se ha denominado por parte de los criticos como poesia negra, poesia negrista, poesia negroide, poesia mulata, poesia afrocubana y poesia afroantillana, para mencionar los nombres mas conocidos. En general, los criticos han usado estas denominaciones para referirse a la tendencia hispanoamericana iniciada en las Antillas y derivada de los movimientos de vanguardia y del gusto por lo negro que caracterizaban la literatura y el arte europeos posteriores a la primera guerra mundial, librada entre 1914 y 1918.Los Cantos populares de mi tierra estan construidos con versos cortos, de ocho o menos silabas, de tono ligero y vivo, que prestan al poema la espontaneidad del habla y la vitalidad dinamica de la vida, rasgos caracteristicos de la poesia de Candelario Obeso. La aparicion en la Bogota de la epoca de un libro de poesias en las que el negro costeno —humilde pero orgulloso—, se expresa de si mismo y de sus inquietudes amorosas, sus preocupaciones sociales, su sabiduria popular y sus sentimientos patrioticos, no causo mucha sensacion editorial. Como es de suponer, en su inmensa mayoria los poetas y escritores colombianos no eran ni negros ni mulatos ni indios, sino personas de familias procedentes de un linaje europeo y que se identificaban con la cultura espanola transplantada a America.No extrana, pues, que la vida, los valores y los sentimientos de la poblacion de ascendencia africana no fueran —especialmente en la poesia— asunto comun en la literatura colombiana. Asi, le corresponderia al poeta Candelario Obeso —negro, costeno, de cuna humilde— presentar a Colombia una imagen intima y digna del negro y comunicar —con la voz autentica de este— el dolor, el orgullo y las esperanzas del pueblo negro colombiano.En sus poesias Obeso adhiere al habla del pueblo de su tierra. Trata de captar y de comunicar la belleza, la espontaneidad, la sencillez —el espiritu— inherentes al habla popular, mediante una fiel reproduccion fonetica de ella y una reelaboracion de su contenido folclorico e imaginativo, que es como la savia del habla. De las peculiaridades linguisticas que caracterizan el habla de los personajes de los Cantos populares, varios son fenomenos bastante generalizados entre los habitantes del litoral atlantico, aunque tienden mas a ser caracteristicas de las clases obreras y campesinas que de las capas altas y educadas. A esta habla inculta se la identifica con los grupos negroides, en cuyos ascendientes africanos se origino, debido a las adaptaciones y modificaciones foneticas que tuvieron que hacer al aprender a llevarse bien con una lengua que no les era familiar y que guardaba poca semejanza con las propias.La obra de Candelario Obeso destaca por su originalidad, el profundo sentido de amor a las virtudes de su raza y un acendrado valor estetico y filosofico que lo hacen merecedor de un lugar desatacado en la bibliografia colombiana.

Here, two of our foremost poets provide a lucid, straightforward anthology for those who have always felt that an understanding of form -- sonnet, ballad, villanelle, sestina, etc. -- would enhance their appreciation of poetry. By example and explanation, the anthology traces ""the exuberant history of forms,"" a history that unites poets as manifold as John Keats and Joy Harjo (the Ode) or Geoffrey Chaucer and Jean Toomer (the Stanza). Each chapter is devoted to one form, offering explanation, close reading, and a rich selection of exemplars that amply demonstrate the power and possibility of the form. In the end, Strand and Boland write, ""we hope that the reader will agree that these forms are -- as we believe -- not locks, but keys."" In linking the expressive potential of a poem to its architecture of syllable and rhyme, this collection is as instructive for the novice as it is inspiring for the practiced poet. - Jacket flap.

W. Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 73,"With this her fourth book of poems, Rita Dove expands her role as a leading voice in contemporary American letters.  The title of the collection serves as an umbrella for the intimate concerns expressed in the forty-eight poems; in music, grace notes are those added to the basic melody, the embellishments that—if played or sung at the right moment with just the right touch—can break your heart.  Isn't this what every lyric poem wishes to be, the poet asks as she explored autobiographical events, most from childhood and the cusp of adolescence, and then turns to the shadowy areas of regret and memory. The word as talisman is another of her concerns, and finally, in the section that most typifies the lilt of grace notes, Dove considers the embellishments below the melody of daily life.

To be the person we dream ourselves to be.  Fragile by nature but tough by circumstance, paper girls are shaped by their love and loss.

Spare and intensely-felt, Valentine’s poems present experience as only imperfectly graspable. This volume gathers together all of Valentine’s published poems and includes a new collection, “Door in the Mountain.”  Valentine's poetry is as recognizable as the slant truth of a dream. She is a brave, unshirking poet who speaks with fire on the great subjects—love, and death, and the soul. Her images—strange, canny visions of the unknown self—clang with the authenticity of real experience. This is an urgent art that wants to heal what it touches, a poetry that wants to tell, intimately, the whole life.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Each poem starts up from its own unique occasion and is then conducted through surprising (sometimes unnerving) and self-steadying domains. The result is a daring, delicate, unguarded, and tender collection. After his last three books--Touch, Blackbird and Wolf, and Middle Earth--in which the sonnet was a thrown shape and not merely a template, Cole's buoyant new poems seem trim and terse, with a first-place, last-ditch resonance. In their sorrowful richness, they combine a susceptibility to sensuousness and an awareness of desolation. With precise reliability of detail, a supple wealth of sound, and a speculative truthfulness, Cole transforms the pain of experience into the keen pleasure of expressive language. Nothing to Declare is a rare work, necessary and durable, light in touch but with just enough weight to mark the soul""--  ""A new collection of poems from the author of Touch and Middle Earth""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But among the many writers who have come of age in our fin de siècle, none have succeeded more completely as poet, critic, and translator than Robert Pinsky.""--James Longenbach, The Nation. The poems in Robert Pinsky's At the Foundling Hospital consider personality and culture as improvised from loss: a creative effort so pervasive it is invisible. An extreme example is the abandoned newborn. At the Foundling Hospital of eighteenth-century London, in a benign and oddly bureaucratic process, each new infant was identified by a duly recorded token. A minimal, charged particle of meaning, the token might be a coin or brooch or thimble--or sometimes a poem, such as the one quoted in full in Pinsky's poem ""The Foundling Tokens."" A foundling may inherit less of a past than an orphan, but with a wider set of meanings. The foundling soul needs to be adopted, and it needs to be adaptive. In one poem, French and German appear as originally Creole tongues, invented by the rough needs of conquered peoples and their Roman masters. In another, creators from scorned or excluded groups--among them Irving Berlin, Quintus Horatius Flaccus, and W.E.B. Du Bois--speak, as does the Greek tragic chorus, in the first-person singular. In these poems, a sometimes desperate, perpetual reimagining of identity, on the scale of one life or of human history, is deeply related to music: The quest is lyrical, whether the subject is as specific as ""the emanation of a dead star still alive"" or as personal as the ""pinhole iris of your mortal eye.""

Knopf|Language English|Pages 171,"A splendid new translation of the classic Arthurian tale of enchantment, adventure, and romance, presented alongside the original Middle English text.It is the height of Christmas and New Year's revelry when an enormous knight with brilliant green clothes and skin descends upon King Arthur's court. He presents a sinister challenge: he will endure a blow of the axe to his neck without offering any resistance, but whoever gives the blow must promise to take the same in exactly a year and a day's time. The young Sir Gawain quickly rises to the challenge, and the poem tells of the adventures he finds--an almost irresistible seduction, shockingly brutal hunts, and terrifyingly powerful villains--as he endeavors to fulfill his promise.Capturing the pace, impact, and richly alliterative language of the original text, W. S. Merwin has imparted a new immediacy to a spellbinding narrative, written centuries ago by a poet whose name is now unknown, lost to time. Of the Green Knight, Merwin notes in his foreword: ""We seem to recognize him--his splendor, the awe that surrounds him, his menace and his grace--without being able to place him . . . We will never know who the Green Knight is except in our own response to him.""From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The word ""Rubaiyat"" means quatrains - verses of four lines. These works by Fitzgerald are the best known English translations. This edition contains both the first and fifth editions of the Rubaiyat. This influential translation is seen by many as a zenith of English literature in the nineteenth century. Fitzgerald states that his translation ""will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very unliteral as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him."" And, ""I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can't retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle.""

We scoot along here in a word-RV bound for just about everywhere, from North Carolina, which possesses, so Starkey claims, an atomic peanut (while Texas doesn’t, but provides blowing sage) to D. C., memorable for kids in the backseat who won’t shut up, to Connecticut centered on “publish or perish” at Yale.  The wonders here depend on constant shifts of focus: sometimes the poems inhabit personae—Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, Elvis (not in Tennessee but in Wisconsin)—sometimes they speak for the poet as memoir; always they surprise and thrill with their oddity of attack, their tart-voiced fearlessness, their range of subject as vast as the great country they so fully evoke.  —Barry Spacks, Santa Barbara Poet LaureateThe book is illustrated by Rafael Perea de la Cabada   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Press|Language English|Pages 251,"“I do not love to wed, / Though I do like to woo,” wrote Robert Herrick, who died as a bachelor. His lyrical poetry, though containing many Classical allusions, is fresh and simple. The author of many love poems, he writes advice to virgins and descriptions of the type of mistress he desires.John Donne, in contrast to Herrick, is the type of poet who married the woman he loved even though it meant having to go to jail because of his disapproving father-in-law. Writing most of his evocative love poems in the 1950s, the decade before his marriage, his poems are full of aching passion.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From a harsh, humble background that he himself described so brilliantly, Kavanagh burst through immense constraints to redefine Irish poetry - a poetry appropriate for a fully independent country, both politically and culturally. Moving beyond Irish verse's preoccupation with history, national politics and identity, he turned to the land and scenery of his native Inniskeen, portraying the closely-observed minutiae of everyday rural and urban life in an uninhibited, groundbreaking style. Lucid, various, direct and engaging, Kavanagh's poems have a unique place in the canon and a unique accessibility.This major new edition is the culmination of many years of work by Antoinette Quinn in creating authoritative texts for Kavanagh's poetry - from his early works such as 'Inniskeen Road: July Evening' to his masterpiece, the epic 'The Great Hunger', allowing us to see the development of Kavanagh's genius as never before.

Toklas had rented in the Rhone Valley, Stanzas in Meditation is one of Stein's most abstract and complex works. It is almost as if Stanzas was conceived as a mirror opposite of The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, penned in the same year. The latter, written in a more direct and normative language, brought Stein international acclaim and resulted in the attention she received from 1934 on, while the former remained unavailable until its publication, after her death, in 1956. To Stein readers and admirers, however, this is one of her most important works, a poetic achievement central to her canon. From John Ashbery's groundbreaking essay-review of Stanzas in 1957 to Richard Bridgman's 1970 publication, Gertrude Stein in Pieces, poets and critics have recognized the importance of this masterpiece.

Walks: A Collection of Haiku,Cendrine Marrouat,poetry,First published in 2019,/works/OL24532544W,/authors/OL9242103A/Cendrine_Marrouat,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32516614M-M.jpg,"Publish Date Jul 08, 2019|Publisher  Independently Published|Pages 44","Haiku are unrhymed poems consisting of about 17 syllables spread over three lines. This poetry form started in Japan and has been very popular in many countries around the world for decades.  Haiku force you to be concise. They teach you impactfulness. As such, they are the embodiment of the ""Show don't tell"" technique. A technique that allows readers to experience stories in a more personal and meaningful manner.  ""Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)"" is not just a celebration of Cendrine Marrouat’s love for haiku. It is also an invitation to enjoy the flitting moments that make life beautiful...  Book available at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07....  Advance reviews:  ""While reading I felt like the author took my hand and whispered to me 'come, let me show you the things you are not seeing with true sight'."" - Natalie Brown (Musician, Vlogger & Entrepreneur)  ""Cendrine’s thoughts are lifted constantly by her keen eye for detail, her interactions with her environment and even how she observes the very elements themselves. She distils each scene that plays out in her haiku snapshots with emotional punch, verve and fierce purity of purpose."" - David Ellis (Award Winning Author of 'Life, Sex & Death – A Poetry Collection')  ""I loved 'Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)' for the same reason I love Haiku in general…  To “get” Cendrine’s haiku as for all, you have to stop racing…slow down…read it thought by thought – image by image…pause…contemplate. Each haiku is a time for time to stand still, while your heart and soul touch the moment."" - Lynne McAnulty-Street (Editor and Publishing Consultant at Red Penn Services Ltd)  ""'Walks: A Collection of Haiku (Volume 1)' takes us to a new dimension, but in the world we live in. It captures the true essence of life and feelings. With new eyes. Minimalist, but great, and strong. A new look into details we often lack to see. Or feel. The precious little things that surround us. And the greatest. It awakes the magic and the dreams.  This writing freezes the moments. Like photography does. Moments we can cherish and keep warmly in our heart.  Cendrine’s haiku are the best I’ve read so far. I strongly recommend the book to everyone."" - Isabel Nolasco (Photographer)  ""Haiku are traditionally difficult to write in a meaningful way, because most writers are limited by the rules of the form. Not Marrouat. She uses the form like a master, crafting her own word combinations to dance within the beats of the Haiku."" - Katrina Moody (Writer & Editor)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Prayers of a Heretic: Poems,Yermiyahu Ahron Taub,poetry,First published in 1998,/works/OL16816928W,/authors/OL1425268A/Yermiyahu_Ahron_Taub,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25443380M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1998|Publisher  Plain View Press|Language English|Pages 256,"Prayers of a Heretic explores the ""crime"" of heresy and the condition of existential displacement through the language of prayer and prayerful voice/s. In the first section, ""Visits and Visitations,"" the poet imagines a variety of protoganists in situations of supplication. The second section, ""In the Gleaning,"" examines the life, trangressions, and prayers of the title character and the primacy of books, libraries, and reading for refuge and reconfiguration. Eschewing a secular/religious divide, the book offers an expansive interpretation of the enduring power of prayer. Four poems also have a Yiddish version.  ———  A hiss. An incantation. Fevered kisses. The heretical. In Prayers of a Heretic, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub sings of the daily, domestic, of the fleshy and the mortal. Listen to these words—dirge, meditation, celebration. Through them, Taub brings us closer to being human and to the divine.    —Julie R. Enszer, author of Handmade Love  Piety has a bad name these days.  But in these lyrical wrestlings with the flesh and the spirit, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub reminds us that the pious are often the most passionate, and the heretics often the most holy.    —Dr. Jay Michaelson, author of Another Word for Sky: Poems  Taub is a master of the character study. His poems are crowded with portraits, novels in miniature, of the old, the overlooked, the dispossessed.  Here you will find Aunt Milkah Pesl, taciturn and unsentimental, the volunteer in assisted living who reads books in Yiddish, the patient in an MRI scanner listening to ""a symphony of terror"" like ""John Zorn on Quaaludes."" There are the regulars in a library, and the treasures found hidden in the pages of old books.  There are lonely men in search of ""fleshly glory.""  And over-arching all, there are repentance and atonement, constantly remade anew.    —Kim Roberts, author of Pearl Poetry Prize-winning Animal Magnetism  This book is a feast: sensuous, ironic, political, hilarious, poignant and wise. Intimately Jewish yet embracing of all, its cast of characters includes aged professors, flirtatious landladies, poem-peddlers and the Pied Piper. In ""Credo,"" a stunning poem near the book's end, Taub powerfully defines religion on his own terms, with equal measures of awe, horror and gratitude at the world.    —Ruth L. Schwartz, author of Edgewater  Whether he's writing in English or Yiddish, in poetry or prayer, Yermiyahu Ahron Taub has a firm grasp on the language of the heart. His characters, men (including one named Yermiyahu) and women whose only crimes are that they are human, are as familiar as our own reflections. In Taub's skilled and attentive hands, no judgments are passed; heresy is in the eye of the beholder.    —Gregg Shapiro, author of GREGG SHAPIRO: 77 and Protection  Prayers of a Heretic chronicles the physical and spiritual dimensions on which life itself depends.  In a word: shelter.  When observed by a poet with Taub's skill and generosity, the acts of seeking, erecting and sustaining shelter become memorably praiseworthy.  Readers will be moved by much in this collection, including the sleeping homeless woman in the library ""who surely traversed the city in storm and sun""; and the unnamed schoolchildren, ""united by navy blue knee socks,"" carefully educated at a religious school (""the palace of certainty shielding the unknowable"").  We aver what Taub avers: ""there is no time assigned for prayer the sanctuary never closes.""     —Kevin Simmonds, author of Mad for Meat  Visit the author's website at http://www.yataub.net/home.html  Categories:    Poetry: General    Poetry: Queer Studies    Poetry : Inspirational & Religious    Social Science : Jewish Studies   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His few published volumes of poetry and frequent public readings established his reputation as one of the most distinctive poetic voices of the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoyed a tremendous popularity. His short, imagistic poems, in the tradition of William Carlos Williams and Kenneth Rexroth, distill the essence of the Northwest landscape and in plain speech celebrate themes of family, friendship, work and quiet contemplation. Included here are the poet's award-winning collections, Bunch Grass, which gave literary voice to the rolling wheat country east of the Cascade Mountains in his native Washington State, and Ish River, which celebrated the misty river landscape of the Puget Sound country, a place, in the poet's words, 'between two mountain ranges where many rivers run down to an inland sea.' But the great part of this collection contains poems unpublished during the poet's lifetime or published only in very limited editions. There is also a generous selection of his translations, from Issa, Buson, Basho, and most especially from the Swedish poet Rabbe Enckell, with whom Sund felt a close affinity. This collection was originally published by Shoemaker & Hoard, and Pleasure Boat Studio is extremely proud to be making it available again.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Subject of Crusade,Marisa Galvez,poetry,First published in 2020,/works/OL20746809W,/authors/OL7040307A/Marisa_Galvez,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  The University of Chicago Press|Language English|Pages 323,"""Marisa Galvez challenges received ideas about medieval lyric poetry and Arthurian romance at a time when terms like ""crusade,"" ""medieval,"" and ""holy war"" continue to be tossed about unexamined in popular media in relation to Islamist fundamentalism. ""The Subject of Crusade"" offers a more complex view of crusade and holy war, arguing that vernacular crusade lyric and romance of the twelfth through fourteenth centuries and related visual artworks of the fifteenth century can tell us a different story if we read them as literary texts as much as historical documents. Placing chronicles and knightly handbooks in conversation with confessional and pastoral texts, she identifies a ""crusade idiom"" that emerged out of a conflict between what European poet/crusaders saw as their pious duty as Christian soldiers, on the one hand, and their earthly duties toward their clans, on the other. How, Galvez asks, does a Christian soldier articulate a sincere intention to go on a crusade while responsibilities toward family and fields at home intervene? Put another way: How does one affirm an intention to physically suffer in Syria in order to help save the Holy Land? Or how do courtly concerns differ for a Frankish knight in faraway Cyprus versus a lord in the relative security of Champagne? By placing crusade love lyric and romances in dialogue with pastoral and confessional documents, Galvez is able to read the conventions and tropes across genres usually kept separate as writers and artists respond to historical and moral problems of the day. The book gives a different picture of how lay people of the period thought about crusading""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ever since she was thirteen years old, Ashanti has kept journals of her poetry, thoughts, and ideas about life and love. Now, in this very personal collection, Ashanti presents her poems about love, along with stories about what (or who) moved her to write them. In Foolish/Unfoolish, Ashanti explores such universal themes as falling head-over-heels in love, becoming insanely jealous, feeling broken-hearted, and being single but having hope for the future. In ""No Words,"" she describes being completely addicted to a new boyfriend; in ""Ride Out,"" she captures what it feels like to be joyriding with your man on a hot summer night; in ""Insecure,"" she writes about telling a suspicious boyfriend to stop driving by her house at night to see if her car is there; and in ""Us,"" she delves into the pain of discovering that your man is cheating on you. Spirited, moving and often filled with humor, Ashanti’s poetry and reflections will entertain and surprise as they offer an intimate look into the life of one of today’s most popular performers. These are works that are both lyrical and raw and which tell the truth about love.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Triggering Town  is Hugo’s classic collection of lectures, essays, and reflections, all “directed toward helping with that silly, absurd, maddening, futile, enormously rewarding activity: writing poems.” From pieces that include “Writing off the Subject” and “How Poets Make a Living,” anyone, from the beginning poet to the mature writer to the lover of literature, will benefit greatly from Hugo’s playful and profound insights into the mysteries of literary creation.

Readers new to Lorde's work will meet here a major American poet whose concerns are international, and whose words have left their mark on many lives. Readers of ""The Black Unicorn"", ""Sister Outsider"", ""The Cancer Journals"", ""A Burst of Light"", and ""Our Dead Behind Us"", and the thousands who have attended her poetry readings and speeches, will recognize in this book the roots and the growing-points of a transformative writer.  Never has a poet left so clear and conscious a track of artistic choices made in the trajectory of a life. Far from rewriting old poems to fit a changes historical moment, she has finely rehoned formal elements to illuminate the original poems. Throughout, Lorde's lifelong themes of love and anger, family politics, sexuality, and the body of the city can be seen gathering in power and clarity.

When Daniel sees a sign on the park gate that says  Poetry in the Park, Sunday at 6,  he wonders,  What is poetry?  and is surprised when a spider tells him:  To me, poetry is when morning dew glistens.  This leads the curious little boy to seek out other park animals and pose the same question. After he hears from Squirrel, Chipmunk, Frog, Turtle, Cricket, and Owl, Daniel creates a lovely poem that he recites at Poetry in the Park, in front of a crowd of poetry-lovers, including all his animal friends.

Poetry will save your life,Jill Bialosky,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL19721908W,/authors/OL542284A/Jill_Bialosky,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL33319016M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 315,"An unconventional and inventive coming-of-age memoir organized around forty-three remarkable poems by poets such as Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens and Sylvia Plath, from a critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling author and poet. For Jill Bialosky, certain poems stand out like signposts at pivotal moments in a life: the death of a father, adolescence, first love, leaving home, the suicide of a sister, marriage, the birth of a child, the day in New York City the Twin Towers fell. As Bialosky narrates these moments, she illuminates the ways in which particular poems offered insight, compassion, and connection, and shows how poetry can be a blueprint for living. In Poetry Will Save Your Life,  Bialosky recalls when she encountered each formative poem, and how its importance and meaning evolved over time, allowing new insights and perceptions to emerge. While Bialosky's personal stories animate each poem, they touch on many universal experiences, from the awkwardness of girlhood, to crises of faith and identity, from braving a new life in a foreign city to enduring the loss of a loved one, from becoming a parent to growing creatively as a poet and artist. In Poetry Will Save Your Life, Bialosky has crafted an engaging and entirely original examination of a life while celebrating the enduring value of poetry, not as a purely cerebral activity, but as a means of conveying personal experience and as a source of comfort and intimacy. In doing so she brilliantly illustrates the ways in which poetry can be an integral part of life itself and can, in fact, save your life. --Amazon   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Lovell|Language English|Pages 437,"Preface     the influences which, during the last half century,have modified the rigor of the prevailing creed of christendom have not been few nor fleeting. Theology has relaxed its grim features. and tacitly abandoned or put out of sight, one by one tenets at variance with the advanced intelligence and religious sentiment of the age. The Poets have, with some exceptions, been in advance of the theologians in giving us ideas of providence and a future life, consistent with the wants and analogies of our nature, and not a variance with the teachings of revelation. Poetry, from the time of Job, has been the mother tongue of devotion and prophecy; and the poets, in their highest moods, have generally been true to those inmost assurances of the soul, which represent a God and an after-life in keeping with our best ideas of omnipotent benignity and love. It will require but a casual glance to see that this is no sectarian book. It will have fulfilled its mission if it help to indicate that the highest human conceptions of the Beautiful and the True are in accordance with the faith which, in the spirit of Christ's teaching, can sincerely and consistently address the Omnipotent as ""our Father,"" And which can look through death in the serene assurance that He "" doeth all things well,"" and that justice will, in this and every future stage of being, be ever tempered with mercy.

""I am a poet who knows the social power of poetry, a United States citizen who knows herself irrevocably tangled in her society's hopes, arrogance, and despair,"" Adrienne Rich writes.  The essays in Arts of the Possible search for possibilities beyond a compromised, degraded system, seeking to imagine something else. They call on the fluidity of the imagination, from poetic vision to social justice, from the badlands of political demoralization to an art that might wound, that may open scars when engaged in its work, but will finally suture and not tear apart. This volume collects Rich's essays from the last decade of the twentieth century, including four earlier essays, as well as several conversations that go further than the usual interview. Also included is her essay explaining her reasons for declining the National Medal for the Arts.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Archeophonics, defined as the archeology of lost sound, is one way of understanding the role and the task of poetry: to recover the buried sounds and shapes of languages in the tradition of the art, and the multitude of private connections that lie undisclosed in one's emotional memory. The book takes seriously the opening epigraph by the late great James Schuyler: ""poetry, like music, is not just song."" It recognizes that the poem is not a decorative art object but a means of organizing the world, in the words of anthropologist Clifford Geertz, ""into transient examples of shaped behavior."" Archeophonics is a series of discrete poems that are linked by repeated phrases and words, and its themes are nothing less than joy, outrage, loss, transhistorical thought, and day-to-day life. It is a private book of public and civic concerns.--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This highly-anticipated debut boldly confronts addiction and courses the strenuous path of recovery, beginning in the wilds of the mind. Poems confront craving, control, the constant battle of alcoholism and sobriety, and the questioning of the self and its instincts within the context of this never-ending fight. From 'Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before': Sometimes you just have to leave whatever's real to you, you have to clomp through fields and kick the caps off all the toadstools. Sometimes you have to march all the way to Galilee or the literal foot of God himself before you realize you've already passed the place where you were supposed to die. I can no longer remember the being afraid, only that it came to an end. Kaveh Akbar is the founding editor of Divedapper. His poems appear recently or soon in The New Yorker, Poetry, APR, Tin House, PBS NewsHour, and elsewhere. He is the author of the chapbook Portrait of the Alcoholic (Sibling Rivalry). The recipient of a 2016 Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation and the Lucille Medwick Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, Akbar was born in Tehran, Iran, and currently lives and teaches in Florida""--   Read more Read less",8 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

In 1877 he left home in search of an education, eventually earning a master's degree. In 1896, Booker T. Washington invited Carver to start the agricultural department at the all-black-staffed Tuskegee Institute, where he spent the rest of his life seeking solutions to the poverty among landless black farmers by developing new uses for soil-replenishing crops such as peanuts, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes. Carver's achievements as a botanist and inventor were balanced by his gifts as a painter, musician, and teacher. This Newbery Honor Book and Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book by Marilyn Nelson provides a compelling and revealing portrait of Carver's complex, richly interior, profoundly devout life.

Heaven,Rowan Ricardo Phillips,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL20006249W?edition=ia%3Aheaven0000phil,/authors/OL7005311A/Rowan_Ricardo_Phillips,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27186338M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 61,"""A spectacularly vibrant and continually surprising collection from one of the poetry world's rising young stars ""Who the hell's heaven is this?"" Rowan Ricardo Phillips offers many answers, and none at all, in Heaven, the piercing and revelatory encore to his award-winning debut, The Ground. Swerving elegantly from humor to heartbreak, from Colorado to Florida, from Dante's Paradise to Homer's Illiad, from knowledge to ignorance to awe, Phillips turns his gaze upward and outward, probing and upending notions of the beyond. ""Feeling, real feeling / with all its faulty / Architecture, is / Beyond a god's touch""--but it does not elude Phillips. Meditating on feverish boyhood, on two paintings by Chuck Close, on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, on a dead rooster by the side of the road in Ohio, on an elk grazing outside his window, his language remains eternally intoxicating, full of play, pathos, and surprise. ""The end,"" he writes, ""like / All I've ever told you, is uncertain."" Or, elsewhere: ""The only way then to know a truth / Is to squint in its direction and poke."" Phillips--who received a 2013 Whiting Writers' Award as well as the PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award--may not be certain, but as he squints and pokes in the direction of truth, his power of perception and elegance of expression create a place where beauty and truth come together and drift apart like a planet orbiting its star. The result is a book whose lush and wounding beauty will leave its mark on readers long after they've turned the last page""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Además que han sido unos meses difíciles: hemos estado huyendo de los compromisos fuera de Ia poesía y eso que la ""tarea poética"" nos puntualiza siempre sus planes, mientras nosotros seguimos soñando, seguimos buscando que alguien nos ayude, que alguien nos de la mano, que no nos dejen ahogarnos en las arenosas piedras de la burocracia cultural. Por suerte hemos ganado por cuarta ocasión, ya, el Fondo de Festivales del Ministerio de Cultura del Ecuador. Esto es prácticamente lo que nos hace estar vivos este año. Llegamos al número ocho casi sin aliento y casi al mismo tiempo del anterior. Literalmente, antes de acabar con el séptimo encuentro teníamos ya la lista del octavo. La vida de algunos de nosotros es casi dependiente del ""Paralelo Cero"", la organizamos pensando en ese cronograma: hermosa magia vital Ia de vivir auscultando la poesía en nuestra lengua para dársela de comer al habitante promedio de nuestro mundillo literario y decirle a cada momento que creemos en Ia poesía, que creemos en Ia vida, que creemos en el arte y que creemos... (Léase la época de crisis a la hora de creer en cualquier cosa). Pero, para algunos, eso es como ver llover. No es nada. Y nada es nada.  La gente sigue diciendo que qué bonito es esto del poema, que qué lindos los poetas, que qué maravilla el trabajo de la gestión literaria, que qué preciosidad ver ese empuje, esa labor, esa tenacidad, esa valentía. Pero luego, lueguito no mas, el discurso de siempre: ""ahorita sí que no se puede"", ""ahorita sí que es bien difícil"", ""ahora mismo no podría ser"", ""ahorita vino a visitarnos la crisis"", ""ahora mismo estamos hecho pedazos"", ""en este momento si que no se puede porque han venido a vernos los heraldos negros, esos de Vallejo, esos mismos, han venido. Que qué duro esta, que qué terrible esta, que qué monstruoso esta. Pero, por el otro lado, que qué lindo esta que trabajes en/con/para/ por Ia poesía. Tal vez te podamos ayudar con, por ejemplo... publico; con, por ejemplo, aplausos; con por ejemplo, barras; con por ejemplo, ánimos; con, por ejemplo, un me gusta en Facebook; con, por ejemplo, una foto compartida; con, por ejemplo, una sonrisita para la selfie; con alguito hemos de apoyar. Aunque, la verdad sea dicha —dicen- no me gusta Ia poesía y, además, que también será: a mí me gusta el arte más cache, más nice, más in, más cool, más fashion. A mí me gusta el arte más de Messi, a mi me gusta el arte más de museo de banco. A mí me gusta el arte así de Teatro bien puesto, de Opera, pero un poco alas cantada, como te diré, de operita, de operita, así de, como te diré, de operar no más mi pc para ver si sale algo bonito, alg6n dibujito, alguna cosita. Ese arte es el mío, porque Ia poesía es bien difícil, ve; bien complicada: yo me acuerdo en el colegio con los poetas Decapitados, que eran unos capos, pero que dolor, oye; que tortura, oye; que tristeza, oye; que melancólicos esos manes, oye. Razón se mataron. ¿Y vos no te vas a matar? No creo no, porque vos ya eres más moderno, vos ya eres más de otra onda, no ve. Vos ya no eres como esos manes. Yo, lo que si prefiero son los pasillos, pero solo cuando ""chupo"". Se siente pleno estar alcoholizado, mientras se escucha esos pasillos de J.J que, según dicen, no han sido ni pasillos, ni ecuatorianos, como nuestra hermosa y popular ""No puedo verte triste porque me matas/ tu carita de pena mi dulce amor..."", dicen que es bolero y que no es escrita por aquí, pero igual eso es poesía, ele.  Cuando uno se siente estar solo y caminar solo, entonces le queda la compañía de la misma poesía. La sombra del poema adentrándose en uno. Saber que los poetas son unos cómplices. La fe que tengo en la poesía es Ia misma que tienen millones en las vírgenes y los santos, en las nubes, en las cosechas, en las herencia, en las tías ricas, en los hijos triunfadores, en los divorcios, en las tierras des-habitadas, en los nuevos amigos, en las canciones nuevas del artista que aman o en el amor a secas.  Con Ia misma rapidez con la que me juego las tardes para trabajar por la poesía, con esa misma atracción, con ese mismo desafío, estamos aquí otro año más para enseñarle al mundo que, pese a todo seguimos siendo amigos de lo imposible.

After her father died in the mines and her mother ran off, he was her last caretaker. They'd always dreamed of leaving Caboose, West Virginia together someday, but instead she's in foster care, feeling more stuck and broken than ever. But then hen Sasha discovers family she didn't know she had, and she finally has something to hold onto, especially sweet little Mikey, who's just as broken as she is. Sasha even makes her first friend at school, and is slowly learning to cope with her brother's death through writing poetry, finding a new way to express herself when spoken words just won't do. But when tragedy strikes the mine her cousin works in, Sasha fears the worst and takes Mikey and runs, with no plans to return. In this sensitive and poignant portrayal, Sarah Dooley shows us that life, like poetry, doesn’t always take the form you intend."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Gay Awareness Week was beginning at the University of Wyoming, and the keynote speaker was Lesléa Newman, discussing her book Heather Has Two Mommies. Shaken, the author addressed the large audience that gathered, but she remained haunted by Matthew’s murder. October Mourning, a novel in verse, is her deeply felt response to the events of that tragic day.  Using her poetic imagination, the author creates fictitious monologues from various points of view, including the fence Matthew was tied to, the stars that watched over him, the deer that kept him company, and Matthew himself. More than a decade later, this stunning cycle of sixty-eight poems serves as an illumination for readers too young to remember, and as a powerful, enduring tribute to Matthew Shepard’s life.

Valerius Flaccus lent sharp Roman refinements and erotic passion to the tale, which are skillfully sustained in this careful and appealing modern translation in English verse.  Apollonius Rhodius’ epic poem Argonautica, written in Greek during the 3rd century BC, has become the de facto standard version of the story of Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. Valerius Flaccus’ Latin epic of the last 1st century AD is by contrast little known, even to those well-read in ancient literature. This translation offers an accurate and appealing version in English verse.  Flaccus’ Argonautica lends keen Roman touches to the tale, amplifying the sense of adventure and the erotic passion found in the Greek. It offers vicarious travel to exotic lands, gripping heroism before wondrous monsters and a dream team of famous Greek heroes. The stirring sea voyage is spiced by the blossoming love of Jason and Medea, young passion not yet gone sour. Michael Barich’s deft translation and lyrical grace notes will delight devotees and newcomers to this timeless classic.  Many know of this tale via the 1963 Columbia Pictures film, with its stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With uncanny insight, Hafiz captures the many forms and stages of love. His poetry outlines the stages of the mystic's ""path of love""-a journey in which love dissolves personal boundaries and limitations to join larger processes of growth and transformation.With this stunning collection, Ladinsky has succeeded brilliantly in translating the essence of one of Islam's greatest poetic and spiritual voices.

W. Norton & Company,              W.W. Norton|Language English|Pages 122","One of our strongest poets of conscience confronts the dangerous new century with intelligence, urbanity, and elegiac humor.  Marilyn Hacker's voice is unique in its intelligence, urbanity, its deployment of an elegiac humor, its weaving of literary sources into the fabric and vocabulary of ordinary life, its archaeology of memory. Desesperanto refines the themes of loss, exile, and return that have consistently informed her work. The title itself is a wordplay combining the Spanish word esperanto, signifying ""hope,"" and the French desespoir, meaning ""to lose heart."" Des-esperanto, then, is a universal language of despair ―despair of the possibility of a universal language. As always in Hacker's poetry, prosodic measure is a catalyst for profound feeling and accurate thought, and she employs it with a wit and brio that at once stem from and counteract despair. Guillaume Apollinaire, June Jordan, and Joseph Roth are among this book's tutelary spirits, to whom the poet pays homage as she confronts a new, dangerous century.

Larry is determined to escape a life of thrifty drudgery and intellectual poverty working for his parents' motel and mini-golf business on Prince Edward Island. Jim appears to the young poet as a beacon of authenticity - mercurial, endlessly creative, fearless in his confrontations with the forces of conformity. And he drinks a lot.  Jim's magnetic personality soon draws Larry's entire poetry composition class into his orbit. Among the other literary acolytes are Sherrie Mitten, with her ringletted blonde hair and guileless blue eyes, the turtlenecked, urbane Claude who writes villanelles, and the champion of rhyming couplets about the heroic struggles of the Maritime proletariat, Todd. Casting a huge shadow over the group is the varsity football player and recreational drug user Chuck Slaughter - titanically strong, capriciously violent, hilariously indifferent to the charms of the poetic life - who has nearly given up terrifying Larry in order to pursue an awkward romantic interest in Sherrie.  Drawn by ambition and fascination, the group assembles itself fawningly around Jim, tagging along to bars, showing up at readings, thrilled to be invited to Jim's home, a shambling farmhouse in the woods where he lives with Moira, his shrewish backwoods muse. Lost in adulation, Larry is so delighted to be singled out for Jim's attention that he does not pause to wonder what Jim expects from his increasingly close relationship with the young poet.

Family connections resurface as she imagines a letter to her mother, long dead, or assesses the shift of responsibility between generations (""...they still love us who overtake us""). Her dialogue with the natural world - especially with the narrow divide between human and animal - continues, most notably in ""Deja Vu"", where she pays homage to her personal totem, the bear. Change and the things that never change attract Kumin's attention equally. Whether chronicling the bounty of summer, the cycle of seasons, or memories of youthful parties and lost friends, her voice is wise, clear, and compelling.

The Complete Poems of John Keats,John Keats,poetry,First published in 1994,/works/OL1455194W?edition=ia%3Acompletepoemsofj00keat,/authors/OL153488A/John_Keats,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1080832M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1994|Publisher  Modern Library|Language English|Pages 398,"'I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death,' John Keats soberly prophesied in 1818 as he started writing the blankverse epic Hyperion. Today he endures as the archetypal Romantic genius who explored the limits of the imagination and celebrated the pleasures of the senses but suffered a tragic early death. Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance Endymion; and the five-act poetic tragedy Otho the Great. Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language. 'No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perception of loveliness,' said Matthew Arnold. 'In the faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in what we call natural magic, he ranks with Shakespeare.'   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

Tolides was born in a tiny village in Greece and his work is rooted in the mountains and wind and the deep interior of that place; his poems express a longing and a searching for peace, for home, for beauty, for escape. These poems constitute a lament, whether they concern themselves with the difficulties of assimilation or the question of whether it is possible for people to live with one another in a spirit of true understanding. They prove that the physical and the metaphysical can share residence, can even be one and the same.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When two sentences collide, a new relationship begins, and Lewis's poems bring sense to these complex and disparate juxtapositions.

This book includes the already famous poem against the Iraq War, ""Call and Answer"": ""Tell me why it is we don't lift our voices these days / And cry over what is happening.""The poems are intimate and yet reach out toward the world: the paintings of Robert Motherwell, the intensity of flamenco singers, the sadness of the gnostics, the delight of high spirits and wit. Robert Bly is writing the best poems of his life, and this book reestablishes his position as one of the greatest poets of our era.

Out-of-the-body travel,Stanley Plumly,poetry,First published in 1977,/works/OL510036W?edition=ia%3Aoutofthebodytrav0000plum,/authors/OL33845A/Stanley_Plumly,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL4901502M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1977|Publisher  Ecco Press|Language English|Pages 48,"Stanley Plumly won the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award for poetry with his last book, In the Outer Dark. This one, a long sojourn into the poet's Ohio childhood in the 1940s, is equally well-crafted. Most of the poems are written in distilled vernacular, and if they are sometimes slightly prosy, they're accessible and never pedestrian. On the contrary, the poems shake up images fixed in memory, and probe them: the picture of Plumly's mother, for example--standing in the doorway in summer, calling his name--recurs compulsively, evoking sometimes terror, sometimes a suffocating sense that the past can't be relived. The same is true of other memories of his family: the poet records a long-gone moment when his father fell drunk to his knees on the porch, and, in a poem called """"Iron Lung,"""" imagines that he himself is forever trapped in that position. Plumly is sentimentally attached to these atmospheric scenes from childhood, but he is also repelled by the larger-than-life, enshrouding quality their particular images possess: """"My whole body is a lung; I am floating/ above a doorway or a grave."""" The poems are not spectacular; when they stop being descriptive, they often take the tone and diction of an incantation or a prayer. But they are sustained in thrust and skillful, and merit a careful reading.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

There are more beautiful things than Beyoncé,Morgan Parker,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL20048237W,/authors/OL7613045A/Morgan_Parker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 85,"""There Are More Beautiful Things Than Beyoncé uses political and pop-cultural references as a framework to explore 21st century black American womanhood and its complexities: performance, depression, isolation, exoticism, racism, femininity, and politics. The poems weave between personal narrative and pop-cultural criticism, examining and confronting modern media, consumption, feminism, and Blackness. This collection explores femininity and race in the contemporary American political climate, folding in references from jazz standards, visual art, personal family history, and Hip Hop. The voice of this book is a multifarious one: writing and rewriting bodies, stories, and histories of the past, as well as uttering and bearing witness to the truth of the present, and actively probing toward a new self, an actualized self. This is a book at the intersections of mythology and sorrow, of vulnerability and posturing, of desire and disgust, of tragedy and excellence""--Publisher.

Stuff I've been feeling lately,Alicia Cook,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL20048233W,/authors/OL3752758A/Alicia_Cook,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English,"In Alicia Cook's second poetic effort, designed in the style of an old mixtape, she sets her thoughts to a nostalgic tune. There is no Table of Contents. Instead, there is a ""Track List,"" making it easy to refer to them to your friends with a, ""Hey did you read track seven?!"" There are no chapters. Instead, the book is divided into two parts, or as one would say in the 90's, two ""sides."" Side A holds poetry that touches on all aspects of the human condition like life, death, love, moving on, evolving, growing up, hometowns, family dynamic, life after trauma, and make-ups and breakups. Side B holds the ""remixes"" of these poems, in the form of blackout poetry, also known as ""found poetry."" Side B gives the material a fresh twist by creating new poetry out of Side A. There is also a very special surprise at the end of each track. Alicia decided to self publish this effort after leaving her publishing house. She views this book as her ""independence"" and official separation from that venture. She also drew the front and back cover herself. Alicia is a contributing writer for many blogs and news outlets, including the Huffington Post and multiple Gannett Publications. She writes regularly on drug addiction and how it directly affects families.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf|Language English|Pages 80","In Special Orders, the renowned poet Edward Hirsch brings us a new series of tightly crafted poems, work that demonstrates a thrilling expansion of his tone and subject matter. It is with a mixture of grief and joy that Hirsch examines what he calls ""the minor triumphs, the major failures"" of his life so far, in lines that reveal a startling frankness in the man composing them, a fearlessness in confronting his own internal divisions: ""I lived between my heart and my head, / like a married couple who can't get along,"" he writes in ""Self-portrait."" These poems constitute a profound, sometimes painful self-examination, by the end of which the poet marvels at the sense of expectancy and transformation he feels. His fifteen-year-old son walking on Broadway is a fledgling about to sail out over the treetops; he has a new love, passionately described in ""I Wish I Could Paint You""; he is ready to live, he tells us, ""solitary, bittersweet, and utterly free.""  More personal than any of his previous collections, Special Orders is Edward Hirsch's most significant book to date.The highway signs pointed to our happiness;the greasy spoons and gleaming truck stopswere the stations of our pilgrimage. Wasn't that us staggering past the riverboats,eating homemade fudge at the county fairand devouring each other's body?They come back to me now, delicious love,the times my sad heart knew a little sweetness.from ""The Sweetness""From the Hardcover edition.

Bishop's poems combine humor and sadness, pain and acceptance, and observe nature and lives in perfect miniaturist close-up. The themes central to her poetry are geography and landscape―from New England, where she grew up, to Brazil and Florida, where she later lived―human connection with the natural world, questions of knowledge and perception, and the ability or inability of form to control chaos.  This new edition offers readers the opportunity to take in, entire, one of the great careers in twentieth century poetry.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Chosen by the author himself, the poems in Notes from the Air represent John Ashbery's best work from the past two decades, from the critically acclaimed April Galleons and Flow Chart to the 2005 National Book Award finalist Where Shall I Wander.While Ashbery has long been considered a powerful force in twentieth-century culture, Notes from the Air demonstrates clearly how important and relevant his writing continues to be, well into the twenty-first century. Many of the books from which these poems are drawn are regularly taught in university classrooms across the country, and critics and scholars vigorously debate his newest works as well as his classics. He has already published four major books since the turn of the new millennium, and, although 2007 marks his eightieth birthday, this legendary literary figure continues to write fresh, new, and vibrant poetry that remains as stimulating, provocative, and controversial as ever.Notes from the Air reveals, for the first time in one volume, the remarkable evolution of Ashbery's poetry from the mid-1980s into the new century, and offers an irresistible sampling of some of the finest work by this ""national treasure.""

Moving through iconic and imagined landscapes, Anybody confronts the strangeness of being alive and of being a restlessly gendered, queer, emotive body. Wherever the poet turns--the cruising spaces of Fire Island, a city lake, a Greek island, a bodega-turned-coffee-shop--he finds the charge of boundedness and signification, the implications of what it means to be a this instead of a that. Witty, tender, and original, these poems pierce the constructs that define our lives"" --   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At the center of the book is a series of seven essays, by turns meditative and polemical, that articulate the interstices between Lauterbach's poetics and her experience. She advocates an active encounter with language, at once imaginative and practical, and argues for the importance of art to the well- being of a democratic society. Lauterbach's ""nimble and glittering"" (Booklist) writings bring us to a new understanding of the relationship between self-knowledge and cultural meaning, as well as demonstrating the ways in which contemporary philosophy and theory might be integrated with practical knowledge.

As he watches the ""Resurrection of the little apple tree outside / my window,"" he shakes off his fear of mortality, concluding ""what death . . . There is only / mine / or yours,-- / but the world / will be filled with the living."" In prayerlike poems he invokes the one ""who spoke the world / into being"" and celebrates a dazzling universe--snowflakes descending at nightfall, the intense yellow petals of the September sunflower, the planet adrift in a blizzard of stars, the simple mystery of loving other people. As Wright overcomes a natural tendency toward loneliness and isolation, he gives voice to his hope for ""the only animal that commits suicide,"" and, to our deep pleasure, he arrives at a place of gratitude that is grounded in the earth and its moods.From the Hardcover edition.

In his new book, Touch, written with an almost invisible but ever-present art, he continues to render his human topics―a mother's death, a lover's addiction, war―with a startling clarity. Cole's new poems are impelled by a dark knowledge of the body―both its pleasures and its discontents―and they are written with an aesthetic asceticism in the service of truth.  Alternating between innocence and violent self-condemnation, between the erotic and the elegiac, and between thought and emotion, these poems represent a kind of mid-life selving that chooses life. With his simultaneous impulses to privacy and to connection, Cole neutralizes pain with understatement, masterful cadences, precise descriptions of the external world, and a formal dexterity rarely found in contemporary American poetry.

The title piece, a folksong-like lament, makes a unified tale out of many stories of many people; the middle section, ""The Black Trailor,"" is a compilation of noir fictions and reflections; while the shorter poems of ""Hemostatic"" range from tough lyrics to sung dramas.

Number Five in the Keystone Chapbook Series, selected as co-winner of the 2009 Keystone Chapbook Prize by Karen J. Weyant:  ""Jeff Walt's collection is filled with dirt, grit and dust. These tough poems squint in the bright light but focus, fear both real and imaginary dangers but still face the day, fall but get up to brush themselves off and move on. Make no mistake. This is not a collection of love poems, but there's love here, hidden in the cracks of sidewalks, in the fur of an old alley cat, even in the aisles of an adult store . . .""  Jeff Walt was born and raised in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. His poems have appeared in numerous journals, including The Gay & Lesbian Review, Inkwell, New Millenium Writings, Clackamas Literary Review, Bamboo Ridge, Bay Windows, and Connecticut Review; in several anthologies, including Gents, Bad Boys, & Barbarians and The Poets' Grimm. He has one previous chapbook, What I Didn't Know (1998), and his full-length collection, The Danger in Everything, was published in 2001 by Mad River Books.

Gedichte Schreiben in Zeiten der Umbrueche,Henrieke Stahl,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL21349900W,/authors/OL8180060A/Henrieke_Stahl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 676,"Gedichte schreiben in Zeiten der Umbrüche - wie reagieren Lyrikerinnen und Lyriker auf die Transformationsprozesse seit 1990? Das interkulturelle und interdisziplinäre Forschungsprojekt soll neue Perspektiven auf die russische wie die deutsche Gegenwartsliteratur eröffnen, fokussiert auf eine literarische Gattung, die traditionell am ehesten und am sensibelsten seismographische Funktionen des Wandels anzeigt: die Lyrik. Der Band fragt nicht nur nach der Bedeutung der politischen Konstellationen des Umbruchs von Sowjetunion zur russischen Föderation und der Wende in Deutschland für die Lyrik, sondern bezieht weitere Diskurse mit ein, die im transnationalen Kontext die Gegenwart seit 1990 bestimmen: Gibt es in Russland und Deutschland parallele Entwicklungen? Welche Differenzen prägen die Gegenwartslyrik beider Länder? Welche Auswirkung haben die seit 2000 verstärkt einsetzende Globalisierung und Digitalisierung sowie die ökonomisch und politisch bedingten Krisen auf die Lyrik? Haben die politischen sowie medialen und technologischen Umbrüche Bedeutung für die Themenwahl, die kommunikativen und ästhetischen Funktionen, die poetischen Verfahren und Strategien? Können für die letzten 25 Jahre poetische und auch poetologisch reflektierte Veränderungen ausgemacht werden? Die Beiträge des Bandes zeigen, dass die neuere russisch- und deutschsprachige Lyrik eine hochgradige Heterogenität und Ungleichzeitigkeit im Hinblick auf Poetik, Stile und Milieus prägen. Hybridität, Experimente mit Grenzen der Gattungen, Sprachen, Medien oder auch zwischen Soziolekten, Kulturen und sozialen Milieus gehen zusammen mit einem hohen Bewusstsein für die Sprachlichkeit, Diskurszugehörigkeit und Performativität von Lyrik. Politisches Bewusstsein in der Lyrik und Radikalität in Tabubruch und Experimenten mit Genre und Sprache, paradox gepaart mit einem hohen poetischen Traditionsbewusstsein, charakterisieren besonders die russische Lyrik der Gegenwart.

This work is breathtakingly immediate, stylistically varied, redemptive, and wise.His familiar landscapes are here—San Francisco, the Northern California coast, the Sierra high country—in addition to some of his oft-explored themes: art; the natural world; the nature of desire; the violence of history; the power and limits of language; and, as in his other books, domestic life and the conversation between men and women. New themes emerge as well, perhaps: the essence of memory and of time.The works here look at paintings, at Gerhard Richter as well as Vermeer, and pay tribute to his particular literary masters, friend Czeslaw Milosz, the great Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer, Horace, Whitman, Stevens, Nietszche, and Lucretius. We are offered glimpses of a surpris­ingly green and vibrant twenty-first-century Berlin; of the demilitarized zone between the Koreas; of a Bangkok night, a Mexican desert, and an early summer morning in Paris, all brought into a vivid present and with a passionate meditation on what it is and has been to be alive. ""It has always been Mr. Hass's aim,"" the New York Times Book Review wrote, ""to get the whole man, head and heart and hands and every­thing else, into his poetry.""Every new volume by Robert Hass is a major event in poetry, and this beautiful collection is no exception.

The artistry that unifies Jubilee is so perfect it is almost invisible. Altogether an amazing debut . . .""    —Philip Levine.  ""In Jubilee, the effects of gravity are reversed in order to capture how the world weighs on the mind . . . These often deceptively measured prose poems critique not only their own form, but the structures, the foundations, of family, spirituality, and identity which we often fail to examine. Each self-portrait tells us as much about the environment as it reveals about the subject occupying them--the poet creating with a small mirror in one hand, a pen/camera/brush/etching knife in the other. . .""    —Kyle G.

A selection of poems chosen from four collections of one of France's authors, Unreconciled shines a fresh light on Michel Houellebecq and reveals the radical singularity of his work. Drawing on themes that are similar to the ones in his novels, these poems are a journey into the depths of individual experience and universal passions. Divided into five parts, Unreconciled forms a narrative of love, hopelessness, catastrophe, dedication, and--ultimately--redemption. In a world of supermarkets and public transportation, indifferent landscapes and lonely nights, Houellebecq manages to find traces of divine grace even as he exposes our inexorable decline into chaos. Told through forms and rhythms that are both ancient and new, with language steeped in the everyday, Unreconciled stands in the tradition of Baudelaire while making a bold new claim on contemporary verse. It reveals that in addition to his work as an incisive novelist, Houellebecq is one of our most perceptive poets with a vision of our era that brims with tensions that cannot--and will not--be reconciled.

In Sea Change, Graham brings us to the once-unimaginable threshold at which civilization as we know it becomes unsustainable. How might the human spirit persist, caught between its abiding love of beauty, its acknowledgment of continuing injury and damage done, and the realization that the existence of a ""future"" itself may no longer be assured?There is no better writer to confront such crucial matters than Jorie Graham. In addition to her recognized achievements as a poet of philosophical, aesthetic, and moral concerns, Graham has also been acknowledged as ""our most formidable nature poet"" (Publishers Weekly). As gorgeous and formally inventive as anything she has written, Sea Change is an essential work speaking out for our planet and the world we have known.

These poems range from personal memory to cultural history to human personae: John Coltrane, Frida Kahlo, Nelson Mandela, and ""The Venus Hottentot,"" a nineteenth-century African woman who was made into a carnival sideshow exhibit.  In language as vibrant within traditional forms as it is within improvisational lyrics, the poems in The Venus Hottentot demonstrate why Alexander is among our most dazzling and important contemporary poets and cultural critics.

Coggeshall (1824-1867) was a journalist and publisher, and editor of The Genius of the West, a literary magazine in Cincinnati. He served as State Librarian of Ohio from 1856 to 1862.  The editor wrote in his Preface that it was his intention to include in the collection every person “…legitimately belonging to the West, who has gained recognition as a writer of reputable verse.” It contains selections, with biographical notices, from the writings of 97 men and 55 women. 60 were residents of Ohio, 23 of Indiana, 14 of Kentucky, 13 of Illinois, 5 of Michigan and 4 of Wisconsin. Not more than 10 of these poets pursued literature as a profession. The volume contains poems from about 1815 to the early 1860s.  The book is very substantial in size and the biographies are sometimes surprisingly detailed. Entries are in chronological order, and the first ones contain valuable background detail about the early literary life of Cincinnati.

Three homeric hymns,N. J. Richardson,poetry,First published in 2009,/works/OL18648444W,/authors/OL1972374A/N._J._Richardson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""These lively narrative poems, attributed in antiquity to Homer, are works of great charm. Composed for recitation at festivals in honour of the gods, they tell of Apollo's birth on the island of Delos and his foundation of the Delphic oracle; Hermes' invention of the lyre and theft of his brother Apollo's cattle; and Aphrodite's love affair with the mortal Anchises. This edition offers a new text of these poems. The Introduction discusses among other things the nature and purpose of the poems in general, their origins, their structure and themes. The Commentary brings out the individual character of each Hymn, by analyzing in depth its language and literary qualities, and also its religious and historical aspects. The aim is to make these Hymns more accessible to students of Greek literature, and help them to appreciate the poems more fully as major works of early Greek poetry""--Provided by publisher.  ""Most of these poems probably belong to the 'Archaic' period, but some appear to be later in date. An Attic vase painting shows a boy holding a papyrus-roll, on which are written what appear to be the opening two words of Hymn. It has been inferred that some at least of the hymns could have already been used as school texts at this time. Our earliest explicit reference to one of the hymns is by Thucydides, who quotes two passages from the Hymn to Apollo,ascribes it to Homer. Later writers, however,from the second century onwards, express doubts about Homer's authorship of the Hymns. Athenaeus attributes the Hymn to Apollo to 'Homer or one of the Homeridae', and a scholiast to Pindar, Nemean ascribes it to a rhapsode named Cynaethus . Hymn is quoted by a scholiast to Nicander as 'among the hymns ascribed to Homer', and some of the Lives of Homer assert that only the Iliad and Odyssey are definitely Homer's own work. Alexandrian scholarship does not often refer to the Hymns, and this suggests that by the Hellenistic period, if not before, their authenticity as Homeric was questioned""--Provided by publisher.

She's starting seventh grade newly friendless and facing big changes at home, where she is about to go from only child to big sister. Feeling alone and adrift, and like her words don't deserve to be seen, Bea takes solace in writing haiku in invisible ink and hiding them in a secret spot. But then something incredible happens, someone writes back. And Bea begins to connect with new friends, including a classmate obsessed with a nearby labyrinth and determined to get inside. As she decides where her next path will lead, she just might discover that her words, and herself, have found a new way to belong.

Sometimes controversial, sometimes ethereal, but always beautiful, her poems move readers of all hues and generations. With Bicycles, she's collected poems that serve as a companion to her 1997 Love Poems. An instant classic, that book — romantic, bold, and erotic — expressed notions of love in ways that were delightfully unexpected. In the years that followed, Giovanni experienced losses both public and private. A mother's passing, a sister's, too. A massacre on the campus at which she teaches. And just when it seemed life was spinning out of control, Giovanni redis-covered love — what she calls the antidote. Here romantic love — and all its manifestations, the physical touch, the emotional pull, the hungry heart — is distilled as never before by one of our most talented poets.

Now, Giovanni continues to stand as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.In a career spanning over thirty years, Giovanni has created a body of work that's become vital and essential to our American consciousness. This collection of new poems is a masterpiece that explores the ecstatic union between self and community. Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea is an extraordinarily intimate collection. Each poem bears our revered cultural icon's trademark of the unfalteringly political and the intensely personal: The elegant ""What We Miss"" exalts the might and grace of women, while ""Swinging on a Rainbow"" rejoices about the spaces in which we read; Giovanni commemorates Africa and her family legacy in the majestic ""Symphony of the Sphinx"" and contemplates our America in the heartbreaking ""Desperate Acts"" and ""9:11:01 He Blew It."" And in the dreamy ""Making James Baldwin"" and dazzling ""Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea,"" Giovanni gives us reason to comfort, to share, to love, to change and to be human. Quilting the Black-Eyed Pea is Nikki Giovanni's meditation on humanity and soul. It's her revelatory gaze at the world in which we live -- and her confession on the world she dreams we will one day call home. Nikki Giovanni is a national treasure as she once again confirms her place as one of America's most powerful truth tellers and beloved daughters.

Is America going down on Canada? What happens when Niagara Falls gets drunk at a wedding? Is it legal to marry a stuffed owl exhibit? What would Walt Whitman's tit-pics look like? Why isn't anyone named Gary anymore? Did the Hatfield and McCoy babies ever fall in love? The steep tilt of Lockwood's lines sends the reader snowballing downhill, accumulating pieces of the scenery with every turn. The poems' subject is the natural world, but their images would never occur in nature. This book is serious and funny at the same time, like a big grave with a clown lying in it.

R.S.

S. Thomas, considered to be one of the leading writers of the twentieth century. This is the first book to treat Thomas's entire oeuvre and will prove to be an indispensible guide and companion to the complete poems. Morgan not only recontextualises and reinterprets the poet's major themes of self, nature, and the search for deity; he breaks new ground with a penetrating investigation of Thomas's long preoccupation with the philosophical and practical implications of science and technology. The book is divided into three parts, each of which interprets the development of a major theme over Thomas's twenty-seven volumes, probing these particular themes and particular poems, with a meticulous insight. The book also treats Thomas's work as a complex and interrelated whole, as a body of work that comprises a single artistic achievement, and assesses that achievement within the context of an array of major literary figures from Montaigne to Seamus Heaney and Wallace Stevens. 'R. S. Thomas: Identity, environment, deity' proves invaluable as a beginner's introduction to the Welsh poet, as a student's guide to critical thinking about the poet's work, and as a provocative new step in scholarly studies.

Snowline,Donato Mancini,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL20928186W,/authors/OL3024389A/Donato_Mancini,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  punctum books|Language English|Pages 102,"?Mais où sont les neiges d?antan?? François Villon?s most famous line is a kind of translation, a variation of the old ?ubi sunt? trope: Where are the things that used to be? But Villon specifically asks: Where are the snows? Even in the thick of a snowy winter, this snow is not the same as the remembered snows. The difference is affective, but it is also ecological: the world?s climate is dramatically changing. Winter itself is changing.  Donato Mancini has collected over eighty translations of Villon?s line, from Thomas Urquhart?s 1653 translation of Rabelais?s quotation of the line, all the way up to translations by Florence Dujarric (2013) and Michael Barnholden (2014). From these he has arranged forty ? a number that once stood for a countless number, like the forty thieves or the forty years of the biblical flood ? into a booklength poem.  Taking a cue from Caroline Bergvall?s ?Via,? but deviating from it in significant ways, snowline traces how Villon?s line has changed and yet stubbornly stayed the same over six hundred years. It is a meditative and pointedly nostalgiac book: You will grow older as you read it, and the world around you will continue to melt into air.

Vertical Readings in Dante's Comedy,Heather Webb,poetry,First published in 2015,/works/OL23498773W,/authors/OL7619951A/Heather_Webb,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 264,"""Vertical Readings in Dante’s Comedy is a reappraisal of the poem by an international team of thirty-four scholars. Each vertical reading analyses three same-numbered cantos from the three canticles: Inferno i, Purgatorio i and Paradiso i; Inferno ii, Purgatorio ii and Paradiso ii; etc. Although scholars have suggested before that there are correspondences between same-numbered cantos that beg to be explored, this is the first time that the approach has been pursued in a systematic fashion across the poem. This collection in three volumes offers an unprecedented repertoire of vertical readings for the whole poem. As the first volume exemplifies, vertical reading not only articulates unexamined connections between the three canticles but also unlocks engaging new ways to enter into core concerns of the poem. The three volumes thereby provide an indispensable resource for scholars, students and enthusiasts of Dante.    The volume has its origin in a series of thirty-three public lectures held in Trinity College, the University of Cambridge (2012-2016) which can be accessed at the Cambridge Vertical Readings in Dante’s Comedy website.""

Yeats's Legacies,Warwick Gould,poetry,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500967W,/authors/OL1483577A/Warwick_Gould,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL46532922M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 684,"""The two great Yeats Family Sales of 2017 and the legacy of the Yeats family’s 80-year tradition of generosity to Ireland’s great cultural institutions provide the kaleidoscope through which these advanced research essays find their theme. Hannah Sullivan’s brilliant history of Yeats’s versecraft challenges Poundian definitions of Modernism; Denis Donoghue offers unique family memories of 1916 whilst tracing the political significance of the Easter Rising; Anita Feldman addresses Yeats’s responses to the Rising’s appropriation of his symbols and myths, the daring artistry of his ritual drama developed from Noh, his poetry of personal utterance, and his vision of art as a body reborn rather than a treasure preserved amid the testing of the illusions that hold civilizations together in ensuing wars. Warwick Gould looks at Yeats as founding Senator in the new Free State, and his valiant struggle against the literary censorship law of 1929 (with its present-day legacy of Irish anti-blasphemy law still presenting a constitutional challenge). Drawing on Gregory Estate documents, James Pethica looks at the evictions which preceded Yeats’s purchase of Thoor Ballylee in Galway; Lauren Arrington looks back at Yeats, Ezra Pound, and the Ghosts of The Winding Stair (1929) in Rapallo. Having co-edited both versions of A Vision, Catherine Paul offers some profound reflections on ‘Yeats and Belief’. Grevel Lindop provides a pioneering view of Yeats’s impact on English mystical verse and on Charles Williams who, while at Oxford University Press, helped publish the Oxford Book of Modern Verse. Stanley van der Ziel looks at the presence of Shakespeare in Yeats’s Purgatory. William H. O’Donnell examines the vexed textual legacy of his late work, On the Boiler while Gould considers the challenge Yeats’s intentionalism posed for once-fashionable post-structuralist editorial theory. John Kelly recovers a startling autobiographical short story by Maud Gonne. While nine works of current biographical, textual and literary scholarship are reviewed, Maud Gonne is the focus of debate for two reviewers, as are Eva Gore-Booth, Constance and Casimir Markievicz, Rudyard Kipling, David Jones, T. S. Eliot and his presence on the radio. ""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The essays, written by a new generation of Longfellow scholars, cover the entire range of Longfellow’s work, from the early poetry to the wildly successful epics of his middle period (Evangeline, The Song of Hiawatha) to his Chaucerian collection of stories published after the Civil War, Tales of a Wayside Inn. Separate contributions discuss Longfellow’s financial dealings, his preoccupation with his children, and his interest in the visual arts, as well as the tremendous role his poetry did and will once again play in American literature classrooms in the U.S. All essays were written specifically for the volume. Many of them rely on unpublished archival sources from the Longfellow collections at the Longfellow House-George Washington National Historic Site and at Houghton Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Purdy's exquisitely surreal fiction has been populated for more than 40 years by social outcasts living in crisis and longing for love. However, Purdy was also among the first novelists to incorporate transgressive renderings of gay life into his work, including unapologetic, sexually explicit material. Narrow Rooms—his 1978 classic that ranks among his most masterful novels—is a passionate and sometimes bloody love story about adolescent obsession and revenge.

But it took the inspired generosity of Oprah Winfrey to honor fully the many gifts of sisterhood. For three amazing days--from May 13 to 15, 2005--a distinguished group of women was invited to celebrate the enduring achievements of twenty-five of their mentors and role models--and in the process pay tribute to the long, glorious tradition of African American accomplishment.The brilliant centerpiece of the weekend was the reading aloud of Pearl Cleage's poem ""We Speak Your Names,"" written especially for the occasion and appearing here for the first time in this beautiful keepsake book. As deeply moving in print as it was during that weekend of love and praise, the poem names each of the women honored: Dr. Maya Angelou, Coretta Scott King, Diahann Carroll, Toni Morrison, Nikki Giovanni, Rosa Parks, Katherine Dunham, and other legends of the brightest magnitude. With heartfelt eloquence, Pearl Cleage (herself a luminary of the younger generation) celebrates her distinguished elders' strength, their magic, their sensuality, their loving kindness, their faith in themselves, and the priceless example of their lives. In her introduction, the poet shares: ""My sisters, here, there, and everywhere, this poem is for you. Use it, adapt it, pass it on. . . ."" Destined to become a classic, We Speak Your Names is a treasure to keep forever and a precious, inspiring gift for the ones you love.From the Hardcover edition.

Heart-wrenching and eye-opening, the ballad also expresses perfectly Wilde's belief that humanity is made up only of offenders, each of us deserving a greater charity for the severity of our crimes.

Know for its iconic revolutionary phrases, it is heralded as one of the most important volumes of modern African–American poetry and is considered the seminal volume of Nikki's body of work.My House (Morrow 1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosphy––This is Giovanni's first foray into the autobiographical.In The Women and the Men (Morrow 1975), Nikki displays her compassion for the people, things and places she has encountered––She reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary.Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (Morrow 1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective of all Giovanni's collections. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s––when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated.Those Who Ride the Night Winds (Morrow 1983) is devoted to ""the day trippers and midnight cowboys,"" the ones who have devoted their lives to pushing the limits of the human condition and shattered the constraints of the stautus quo.

Here, Divakaruni is particularly interested in how different art forms can influence and inspire each other. One section, entitled Indian Miniatures, is based on and named after a series of paintings by Francesco Clemente. Another, called Moving Pictures, is based on Indian films, including Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" and Satyajit Ray's ""Ghare Baire."" Photographs by Raghubir Singh inspired the section entitled Rajasthani. The trials and tribulations of growing up and immigration are also considered here and, as with all of Divakaruni's writing, these poems deal with the experience of women and their struggle to find identities for themselves.This collection is touched with the same magic and universal appeal that excited readers of Arranged Marriage. In Leaving Yuba City, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni proves once again her remarkable literary talents.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From revved-up battle-cry to nervous whisper, these lyrical poems praise intricate abundance. Assured in its rhymes and cadences, Full Volume is often attentive to poetry in other tongues, not least Gaelic. As their tones and forms shift from the spiritual to the wry, from haiku to brosnachadh, the poems' resonance and music build into a sustained sounding of what it means to live, love, and listen in a world where 'Nothing is ever single'.

"The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni, 1968–1998",Nikki Giovanni,poetry,First published in 2003,/works/OL2001558W?edition=ia%3Acollectedpoetryo00giov,/authors/OL241042A/Nikki_Giovanni,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23271529M-M.jpg,"Publish Date November 25, 2003|Publisher  William Morrow|Language English|Pages 452","For the first time ever, the complete poetry collection spanning three decades from Nikki Giovanni, renowned poet and one of America's national treasures.When her poems first emerged during the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, Nikki Giovanni immediately took her place among the most celebrated, controversial, and influential poets of the era. Now, more than thirty years later, Giovanni still stands as one of the most commanding, luminous voices to grace America's political and poetic landscape.The first of its kind, this omnibus collection covers Nikki Giovanni's complete work of poetry from three decades, 1968–1998. The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni contains Giovanni's first seven volumes of poetry: Black Feeling Black Talk, Black Judgement, Re: Creation, My House, The Women and the Men, Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day, and Those Who Ride the Night Winds. Arranged chronologically with a biographical timeline and introduction, a new afterword from the author, title and first-line indexes, and extensive notes to the poems, this collection is the testimony of a life's work -- from one of America's most beloved daughters and powerful poets.Known for their iconic revolutionary phrases, Black Feeling Black Talk (1968), Black Judgement (1968), and Re: Creation (1970) are heralded as being among the most important volumes of contemporary poetry. My House (1972) marks a new dimension in tone and philosophy -- it signifies a new self-confidence and maturity as Giovanni artfully connects the private and the public, the personal and the political. In The Women and the Men (1975), Giovanni displays her compassion for the people, things, and places she has encountered -- she reveres the ordinary and is in search of the extraordinary. Cotton Candy on a Rainy Day (1978) is one of the most poignant and introspective. These poems chronicle the drastic change that took place during the 1970s -- in both the consciousness of the nation and in the soul of the poet -- when the dreams of the Civil Rights era seemed to have evaporated. Those Who Ride the Night Winds (1983) is devoted to ""the day trippers and midnight cowboys,"" the ones who have devoted their lives to pushing the limits of the human condition and shattering the constraints of the status quo.Each volume reflects the changes Giovanni has endured as a Black woman, lover, mother, teacher, and poet. A timeless classic, The Collected Poetry of Nikki Giovanni is the evocation of a nation's past and present -- intensely personal and fiercely political -- from one of our most compassionate, vibrant observers.

Her last collection, Mysteries of Small Houses, was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize in poetry and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Structured as a long series of interconnected poems in which one of the main elements is an ongoing dialogue with a seedy detective, Disobedience sets out to explore the visible as well as the unconscious. These poems, composed during a fifteen-month period, also deal with being a woman in France, with turning fifty, and with being a poet, and thus seemingly despised or at least ignored.

Jafar ibn Mohammad Rudaki (c. 880 CE-941 CE) was a poet to the Samanid court which ruled much of Khorâsân (northeastern Persia) from its seat in Bukhara. He is widely regarded as the father of Persian poetry, for he was the first major poet to write in New Persian language, following the Arab conquest in the seventh and eighth centuries, which established Islam as the official religion, and made Arabic the predominant literary language in Persian-speaking lands for some two centuries. This book presents Rudaki as the founder of a new poetic aesthetic, which was adopted by subsequent generations of Persian poets. Rudaki is credited with being the first to write in the rubâi form; and many of the images we first encounter in Rudaki?s lines have become staples of Persian poetry.

الشعر والدين: فاعلية الرمز الديني المقدس في الشعر العربي,Kāmil Ṣāliḥ,poetry,First published in 2005,/works/OL12391297W,/authors/OL5452639A/Kāmil_Ṣāliḥ,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22848338M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Dār al-Ḥadāthah|Language Arabic|Pages 416,كتاب الشعر والدين : فاعلية الرمز الديني في الشعر العربي،    هو للكاتب والأكاديمي اللبناني كامل فرحان صالح - kamel farhan saleh    صدر في طبعته الأولى عن دار الحداثة في بيروت، ولدى المجلس الأعلى للثقافة، القاهرة في العام 2010، في طبعة ثانية.    الكتاب يقع في 416 صفحة من القطع الكبير، ويضم ثلاثة أبواب، وكل باب ينقسم إلى فصول عدة:    الباب الأول ويضم فصلين: قرأ الكتاب فيه فاعلية النص الديني في الشعر العربي في أبرز محطاتها. واستهل بمدخل بحث في العلاقة بين الدين والشعر.    الفصل الأول تناول الدين والشعر في المجتمع العربي القديم، من خلال النصوص المتأثرة بالوثنية والحنيفية، الفصل الثاني خصص للرموز الدينية في الشعر العربي ما قبل الحديث،    أما الباب الثاني فبحث في إرهاصات الهوية العربية في بدايات القرن العشرين، كذلك تناول المؤثرات الغربية في الشعر العربي، واشتمل على فصلين:الفصل الأول، بحث في صراعات الذات الثقافية العربية، وخصص جانبًا لقراءة النظرة السلفية للتجديد في الشعر العربي.    الفصل الثاني بحث في المؤثرات الأجنبية في الشعر العربي الحديث، ولاسيما من خلال تأثير الأرض الخراب The Waste Land لـ ت. س. إليوت. وركّز في هذا الإطار على تأثير إليوت في    شعر بدر شاكر السياب ويوسف الخال وخليل حاوي. كذلك حاول الكتاب تقديم قراءة في دور مجلة شعر، لاسيما صراع الهوية وتفعيل حضور الآخر فيها.أما الباب الثالث والأخير فخصص لبحث فاعلية الرمز الديني في الشعر العربي الحديث، وضمّ فصلين: الفصل الأول قرأ سعيَ الشعراء العرب المعاصرين لإيجاد صيغة جديدة للشعر، وعلاقة هؤلاء الشعراء بالتراث والمجتمع، والنظرة للغة العربية. ولم ينس أن يبحث في محاولاتهم لاختراق النظام الشعري المتوارث.    الفصل الثاني تناول حضور التأثير الديني في الشعر العربي الحديث، ولاسيما من خلال فاعلية الحضور والتحول. واشتمل كذلك على تأثير الأسطورة في الشعر، والعلاقة الإشكالية وحضور هذا التشابك في الشعر.كما بحث هذا الفصل في جوانب أكثر تحديدًا في مفاصل فاعلية التأثير الديني في الشعر، فتناول البحث في أبعاد دينية متنوعة ومختلفة في الشعر، ولاسيما حضور الخبز أو العشاء الأخير، كذلك حاول أن يتناول عددًا من الأماكن والاشارات الدينية في الشعر العربي المعاصر.    أما المنهج الذي اتبعه الكتاب، فيوضح المؤلف في المقدمة ان منهج دراسته اتصف بقدر كبير من المرونة التي يمكن أن تتسع، وتلم بحدوده المتشعبة، لذا، المنهج الذي اعتمده زاوج فيه بين منهجين، وهما:    أ- المنهج التاريخي، لملاحقة تطورِ مسارِ العلاقةِ بين الشعرِ والدين، وعلاقات التأثير والتأثر .    ب- المنهج التحليلي، لرصد مدى تأثير النصِّ في إنجازات النص الشعري، ومستوياتِ هذا التأثيرِ على الشكل والمضمون الشعري، ثم القراءة التحليلية المقارنة الموضوعية للامساك بما تناثر من اللاوعي الشعري من الرموز الدينية في متنِ المنجزِ الشعري وحوافيه.    يستهل الكاتب كتابه بالقول انه عندما أراد الشعراء العرب المعاصرون التعبيرَ عن أزمة ما تعصف بمجتمعاتِهم أو بكيانِهم، اختارَ قسم منهم، أن يتكئَ على بعدٍ دينيٍّ في شعره، ليطلَ من خلاله على ما يريد قوله، موظفًا لذلك لفظةً تحسب على هذا النص الديني أو رمزًا ينسب إليه أو حالةً تجد مساحتَها الخصبة فيه ومنه.    واضاف قائلا: إن ركون الشعراء العرب المعاصرين للنص الديني ، حضر بعمقٍ، ليعبّر عن قلقٍ وجوديٍّ إنسانيٍّ مجتمعيّ يعيشه الشاعر بكيانِه كلِّه؛ فالشاعر خليل حاوي على سبيل المثال كتب قصيدتَه 1962، عندما أراد إعلان رفضهِ، والتعبير عن حال الإحباط، التي يشعر بها هو والمجتمع العربي كلُّه، بسببِ الانفصال بين مصر وسوريا، كذلك لجأَ الشاعر بدر شاكر السياب ، ليكتبَ قصيدتَه: عندما أرادَ التعبير عن قلقِه مما يتخبط به الواقع العربي عامةً والعراقي خاصةً، ولم يبتعد الشعراءُ أمثال أدونيس ويوسف الخال وأنسي الحاج وأمل دنقل وعبد الوهاب البياتي ومحمد الماغوط عن ذلك المسار، حيث أخذ كلُّ واحدٍ منهم من التربة الدينية ما يتناسبُ وزرعَهُ، أي قصيدتَه، موظفًا رمزًا دينيًّا يشق من خلاله حجب مشاعره ورؤاه وهواجسه ويأسه ومأزقه الوجودي.هذا الأخذ من النصِّ الديني ، لم يكن وليدَ هؤلاء الشعراء آنذاك،- حسبما يوضح الكاتب - إنما تتناثر جذوره عميقًا في التاريخِ العربي والعالمي على السواء، إذ كان الشعر يتلبس الدين للخروج إلى مساحاتٍ أوسعَ من الواقع المباشر إلى مسافةٍ تمتد بين الأرضِ والسماء، كما أن الدينََ كان يجد حضوره الخصب ، في التعبير الشعري.أمام هذه العلاقة التشابكية بين الشعر والدين، شرع الكاتب العمل في هذا البحث، محاولاً رصد هذا الحضور الإبداعي، وتلمسَهُ، عبر نماذجَ من الشعرِ العربي عامةً والحديثِ خاصةً، واقفًا على آفاقه الرحبة والغنية والملتبسة.وقد جمع مادته البحثية على مراحل - كما يقول- بدأت من دواوين الشعراء القدامى والمعاصرين، حيث جرى ما يُشبه الرصدَ للنصوص الخاضعة لشروط البحث، ترافق ذلك بقراءة للنصوص الدينية ، ثم مقاربة الدراسات التاريخية والإنسانية والانثربولجية والنقدية التي كانت تتعارض أو تلامس بشكل أو بآخرَ مسار بحثه.أما بالنسبة إلى تحديدِ الشعراء، فركّز الكتاب على بعض الشعراء الذين طبعُوا زمنَهم بإسهامات شعرية مميزة، كان لها الأثر البارز والواضح في حركة الشعر العربي الحديث، أمثال: بدر شاكر السياب، خليل حاوي، أدونيس، يوسف الخال، أنسي الحاج، أمل دنقل، محمد الماغوط.    وكانت دراسته لنماذجَ من شعرهم الذي خضع لشروط الموضوعات المبنية على المؤثرات الدينية.    كامل صالح يخلص في كتابه للقول ان العلاقة بين الدين والشعر واضحة في المجتمعات العربية القديمة -قبل الإسلام- من خلال العديد من النماذج الشعرية التي قاربت القضايا الدينية، وكانت - بهذه الدرجة أو تلك - تعبر عن القناعات والآراء والتعاليم والحكم الدينية، وذهب بعض الدارسين إلى القول إن الشعر العربي نشأ في حضن الدين، وإن هذه البدايات تبدو واضحة في أنماط الأهازيج الشعرية ذات الطابع الديني، ولاسيما تلك التي تستخدم في بعض الممارسات الدينية.وقد بدا واضحًا تأثر النص الشعري بالنصوص الدينية - قبل الإسلام - في العديد من النصوص الشعرية التي تؤكد تأثر واضعيها حيث ظهرت بوضوح في بعض النماذج الشعرية العربية قبل الإسلام.    ويلحظ الكاتب ان الشاعر العربي - قبل الإسلام - كان حرًا في علاقته بالنصوص المقدسة، إلا أنه ظل يحتفظ بمسافة بين: الشعري والنص ، حيث لم يكن يعارضه، أو يحاول محاذاته، إلا أنه أعطى نفسه هامش التعبير عن القيم الدينية بلغته، وبطريقته الخاصة، لكن لم يقارب هذه النصوص المقدسة بأي شكل من الأشكال، بل ظل صدى لها، يعبر عن قيمها وتعاليمها.بالمقابل يرى الكاتب ان الشعر تراجع مع الإسلام، الذي أبدى شيئًا من التحفظ على الممارسة الشعرية، ووضع لها شروطًا، وحدد لها حدودًا، فسادت وسيطرت سلطة النص القرآني بصورة مطلقة على كل قول، حيث إنه اختزل صور القول الحق كلها، واكتفى الشعر بهامش ترديد صدى التعاليم الإسلامية، أو لاذ بهامش الهرطقة والمجون ليعبر عن نفسه.    وخلال القرون ما بعد العصر العباسي وإلى بدايات الخلافة العثمانية، لاحظ الكاتب إن حركة الشعر تجمّدت شكلاً في البحور الخليلية، ومضمونًا في الأغراض التعليمية والاخوانيات والغزل المبتذل، والتقريظ والمدح والهجاء المكرر الخالي من الإبداع والتجديد، إلى أن تعرض العالم العربي لصدمة اتصاله بالغرب، فاتضح له مدى تخلفه وضعفه ، فكان أن نشأت - نتيجة لهذا الغزو - بعض التيارات التي تراوحت ردود فعلها في ثلاثة اتجاهات: اتجاه ينادي بضرورة اتباع الغرب في كل شيء، والأخذ منه بلا قيد ولا شرط. واتجاه ينادي برفض كل ما هو غربي ومقاطعته، ورفض الغرب ذاته، متمسكًا ومتخندقًا في هويته الذاتية السلفية. أما الاتجاه الثالث فحاول التوفيق بين الاتجاهين، فسعى يبحث عن جذور ما أنتجه الغرب في ثقافته العربية/ الإسلامية.    بناء على ذلك، صنف الكاتب هذه الاتجاهات في ثلاثة تيارات: حداثية، وسلفية، وتوفيقية، مؤكدا ان صدمة الاتصال بالغرب (الغازي) أحدثت شروخًا في الذات العربية، هي التي حددت اتجاهاته الفكرية/ الانفعالية في الحدود والتيارات التي حددت سابقًا.واضاف قائلا بدا تأثير هذا الاتصال/ الصدمة واضحًا في حركات التجديد الشعري منذ أوائل القرن الماضي، سواء في المهجر أو في مصر - مدرسة الديوان-، إلا أن إرهاصات هذا التأثير بدت واضحة في المدارس الشعرية التي تأثرت بالمدرسة الرومانطيقية - أبولو -، وفي بعض محاولات الخروج الشعرية الفردية.    إزاء هذه المحاولات التجديدية المتأثرة بالثقافة الغربية، يتناول الكاتب نشاط حركة النقد السلفي، التي حاولت التصدي لهذا التيار التغريبي، حسب رأيها. إلا أن ردة فعلها العاطفية في مواجهة محاولات التجديد دفعتها إلى حد المقاومة القصوى، حين تعاملت مع هذه الحركة باعتبارها مؤامرة ثقافية تستهدف وجود الأمة، ودينها وتاريخها، من هنا راحت تحاكم هذه الحركة التجديدية بهذا المعيار السياسي والأخلاقي، والمعيار الديني بشكل أساس.ويضيف قائلا ان النقد السلفي تأسس على رؤية تمازج ما بين الديني والتقليدي، لذا، اقتصرت مرجعياته النقدية على خطين متقاطعين بالضرورة: من حيث الشكل، التقنية الخليلية هي المرجع لـ form القصيدة، والقصيدة الجاهلية هي المعيار الفني المتكامل، حسب رأي هذا الاتجاه، أما من حيث المضمون فالإسلام وتعاليمه هو المصدر والمرجع لمضمون القصيدة.    إلا أن المسيرة التجديدية في الثقافة العربية عامة، والشعر خاصة، أخذت تشق طريقها، كما يقول الكاتب، تحت تأثير الاتصال المباشر بالثقافة الغربية، ليلاحظ الباحث أن تيار التجديد تجاوز - في الهزيع الأخير من أربعينيات القرن الماضي - الأطر التقنية الشكلية للقصيدة العربية، ليلامس - بالتجاوز - أطرًا أعمق وأكثر جذرية: اجتماعية وثقافية ودينية وفكرية، ويمكن القول إن التيار الحداثي أخذ يرسخ رؤيا شاملة مغايرة للكون والحياة والإنسان.    ويلاحظ الباحث أن شعراء الحداثة العربية انطلقوا في حركتهم الثورية تلك، ليس نتيجة حراكٍ تاريخي ثقافيٍ عربي محض، إنما تحت مظلة التأثير الشعري لكل من عزرا باوند وإليوت وسوزان برنار وبودلير ورامبو ولوتريامون واديث ستويل وغيرهم من شعراء الغرب ونقاده، وقد توالت اعترافات شعراء الحداثة بهذا التأثير بصراحة ووضوح.    كذلك يمكن القول، إن الاتكاءَ على المساحةِ الإبداعيةِ الغربية هي التي دفعت الى بروزِ الرموزِ في الشعرِ العربي المعاصر، ويعني هذا بالتالي، أن التأثرَ بالنصوصِ كانت هي بدورِها، نتيجةَ التأثرِ بالآخرِ .    ويمضي الكاتب قائلا: الشاعر العربي أخذ يحاول أن يستعيد مكانته ككائن رؤيوي، وأخذ الشعر يستعيد وظيفته الرؤيوية/ ولعل من هنا انفتح الباب على علاقة مختلفة بين الشعر والدين.    اما أبرز مميزات التجربة الشعرية الحداثية العربية التي اشار اليها الكاتب فهي الخروج عن الذاتية التي وسمت القصيدة الرومنطيقية، وسعيها الحثيث للتعبير عن قضايا الإنسان المعاصر، وأزمته الروحية العميقة.    ولعل هذا ما دفع الشاعر الحداثي للعودة إلى لعب الدور الذي برز فيه في بداية الحضارة الإنسانية. كذلك عاد الشعر إلى مكانته الحقيقية في التراث البشري بما هو كشف ورؤيا تنير آفاقًا جديدة وتكشف حقائق الحياة وتلامس كبد الوجود.    ويرى الكاتب ان الشعر العربي الحديث لم يستخدم في بعضِ نماذجه التي تناولها البحث، الرمز الديني بشكلٍ عابرٍ أو بسيط، بل صهر هذه الرموز ضمن حدس واعٍ يتوسد الرؤية الاستشرافية والاستيعاب النقدي للماضي، قوامه الرؤية التي تنفذ عبر مظاهر الواقع إلى الحقائق الجوهرية للوجود، وتعبر عن نفسها تعبيرًا مجازيًا يصل ذروته بالنموذج الأصلي والقصص الأسطورية.    ويؤكد الكاتب ان المعادلة انقلبت مع الشعر الحداثي. وانفلت الشاعر من سطوة النص وسلطته، وحاول إنتاج نصٍ شعريٍّ يعكس فيه آلام الإنسان، وعذابه الوجودي، واحتجاجاته الأخلاقية على الظلم والاضطهاد، مشيرا الى ان الشاعر الحديث سعى جاهدًا - من خلال بناء عالم قصيدته - إلى أن يكون مركزها الإنسان وسعى للتعبير عن وضعِه المأساوي السوداوي إزاء اشتراطاتٍ اجتماعيةٍ وسياسية قاسية، وللتعبير عن غربته وضياعه في هذا العالم، فبعد أن كانت القصيدة في السابق تتمحور حول الأعلى، وتدور في فلكه، أو تهرب من الواقع نحو الطبيعة والسكينة والرتابة، جاء الشاعر الحديث ليعكس الاتجاه، وبدل أن يتجه من الأسفل إلى الأعلى، أو من الذات إلى الأمام - الوراء، بات الاتجاه من الأعلى إلى الأسفل، ومن الأمام إلى الذات - الـ نحن.    لكن السؤال الذي طرحه البحث: لمَ كان التركيز على أسطورة أدونيس في الشعر العربي المعاصر،؟. إذا كان من الصعوبةِ بمكان مساءلة الشاعر الحديث لمَ اعتمد هذا، وركن ذاك جانبًا؟ إلا أنّ دارسي الأدب العربي الحديث وضعوا هذا في خانة الأسطورة، وغضّوا الطرف عن كون هذا رمزا .    وهذا ما أدى، بالتالي، إلى نسبة فاعلية هذه الرموز الدينية في النص الشعري على أساس أنها أسطورة وليست دينية، مما يعني انزياحًا مقصودًا لهذه الرموز، وتوظيفًا لها ضمن أطرٍ غير واضحة الحدود.    لكن، يقول كامل صالح في كتابه، انه يمكن فهم ارتكاز الشاعر العربي الحداثي على الرمز أو الأسطوري، بمقاربة الوضع الذي كان يمرّ على العالم العربي، ولا يزال، من ضياع فلسطين إلى استبداد السلطة، إلى الفقر والحروب، ويمكن الوقوف على أهمية هذه الرموزِ وإيحاءاتها في شعرٍ عربي يحاول أن يبثّ خطابه الرافض من خلال القصيدة، إذ تماهى الشاعر الحديث متمثلاً دوره لإنقاذ شعبه، جاعلاً من قصيدته درب جلجلة تحتضر الحياة فيها لتعودَ من جديدٍ نضرةً خالية من الشر، وتحملُ الخلاص للجميع. فالإنسانُ المعاصرُ يعيشُ في حالةِ عقمٍ وجدب، لذا على الشاعر أن يكونَ هو الجديد الذي يفدي بنقائه الأمثل انحطاط القرن العشرين، كما يقول الناقد غالي شكري، ذلك بعد أن انبحّ فينا الصوت ، على حد تعبير يوسف الخال.

In thirty-seven poems, using a variety of dramatic voices and visual techniques, she finds meaning in unexpected places, from a tour of a doll hospital to an ad for a CD of Beethoven symphonies to an earthy exploration of toast. Gerstler's abiding interests-in love and mourning, in science and pseudoscience, in the idea of an afterlife, in seances and magic-are all represented here. Entertaining and erudite, complex yet accessible, these poems will enhance Gerstler's reputation as an important contemporary poet.

The influence of Hafez and Rumi is clear, and yet the poems descend into the wealth of Western history, referring at times to Monet, Giordano Bruno,Emerson, St. Francis, Newton, and Chekhov, as well as to events in Bly's own life. The leaping between joy and ""ruin"" produces a poetry which makes him, as Kenneth Rexroth noted, ""one of the leaders in a poetic revival which has returned American literature to the world community.""

Most of us started out loving poetry because it filled our beloved children's books from Dr. Seuss to Robert Louis Stevenson. Eventually, our reading shifted to prose and later when we encountered poetry again, we had no recent experience to make it feel familiar. But reading poetry doesn't need to be so overwhelming. In an entertaining and engaging voice, Thomas C. Foster shows readers how to overcome their fear of poetry and learn to enjoy it once more.""--Back cover.

The hot house: life inside Leavenworth Prison,Pete Earley,poetry,First published in 1992,/works/OL15103507W?edition=ia%3Ahothouselifeinsi00earl,/authors/OL27852A/Pete_Earley,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1546154M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1992|Publisher  Bantam Books|Language English|Pages 383,"Author of the acclaimed Family of Spies, Pete Earley is the first writer ever permitted unlimited access to America's oldest federal prison. Out of the iron belly of this maximum-security penitentiary comes his stunning account of life behind bars--the nation's hardest criminals doing hard time... It's a self-contained metropolis behind vast walls built in 1895; a lethal place governed by ruthless clans competing for dominance. Murder is frequent, rape is less for sex than for power, and respect is the coin of the realm. Once disrespected, a Leavenworth inmate has two choices: he can submit to virtual slavery--or he can fight his antagonist until one of them dies.  Nicknamed ""the Hot House"" because of the sweltering conditions of its cellblocks, the federal penitentiary in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, seethes with the pervasive threat of riot. It is the most dreaded facility in the system--not because of its maximum-security rating, but because of its fierce population: sociopathic gangsters, Aryan Nation neo-Nazi killers, muscle toughs, ruthless narcotics profiteers, and heavyset bikers pockmarked with bullet wounds like acne scars. Even the shaven-legged ""punks,"" the drunks, and the junkies may be carrying homemade ""shank"" knives under their shirts.  Pete Earley, celebrated investigative reporter, conducted literally hundreds of hours of interviews, all but living inside the primordial world of Leavenworth. Out of this extraordinary firsthand access, as well as essential documents, telephone transcripts, and prison files, comes the riveting story of what life is actually like inside this most famous of prisons. The Hot House depicts the gulf between the thinking of us ""Square Johns"" and the inmates--people a Hot House prison psychologist termed as having ""only two emotions, fear and anger. Everything these inmates do revolves around those two emotions and nothing else."".  The Hot House focuses on a few of the ""star"" players in Leavenworth: among them Carl Cletus Bowles, the sexual predator with a talent for murder; Dallas Scott, a gang member who, at age forty-two, has spent almost thirty of those years behind bars; Warden Robert Matthews, who put his shoulder against his prison's immovable grim reality; Thomas Silverstein, a sociopath confined in ""no human contact status"" since 1983; and William Post, a bank robber with a criminal record going back to when he was eight years old, and the nickname ""Catman"" because he takes devoted care of the cats that live inside Leavenworth. The inmates are kept under control by an enormous staff of guards, whose main job is to keep the turf wars at bay and quell riots before they erupt.  Not only a gripping account of real men behind bars and those who control them, Pete Earley's book is also a startling meditation on national prison policy. The United States has the dubious distinction of locking up the highest percentage of its population of any country in the world. The subject matter of The Hot House: Life Inside Leavenworth Prison colors our daily lives and fills every night's newscasts. This disquieting book compels wide attention.

Curiously, this labor of love started with the author's signature: Faced with the daunting task of providing autographs for multiple copies of one of her poetry collections, Absolute Trust in the Goodness of the Earth, Walker turned an act of repetition into an act of inspiration. For each autograph became something more than a name: a thoughtful reflection, an impromptu sketch, a heartfelt poem. The result is this spontaneous burst of the unexpected. A Poem Traveled Down My Arm is a lovely collection of insights and drawings--by turns charming and humorous, provocative and profound--that represent the wisdom of one of today's most beloved writers.  The essence of Walker's independent spirit emanates from words and images that are simple but deep in meaning. An empowering approach to life...the inspiration to live completely in the moment...the chance to nurture one's creativity and peace of mind--all these beautiful elements are evoked by this unusual and original book.From the Hardcover edition.

Valjean Publishing|Language English, French|Pages 126","Bilingual Edition: French-English / Edition Bilingue : Français-Anglais  In Springtime’s Odyssey, the reader finds themselves immersed in a dream where they can sketch out their own desires for liberty. They move through a world both enchanting and nightmarish, one which they can choose to make real or leave to the imagination by only lifting their eyes from the last lines to pursue other avenues of escape.    Each poem has a kind of lightheartedness that enables it to be picked out at random and savored like a piece of candy, which affords the reader the pleasure of possessing their passions, right down to the shivers on their skin.  “With my gaze    I will reveal to you    My most surprising thoughts,    My most ambiguous joys,    My most ardent desires.    And if you know what to make of them,    You will know how to bring me to death    And bring me to life in your hands.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Uniquely, the book is divided by genre, allowing readers to make connections between texts usually presented individually.  This anthology offers a fruitful exploration of the boundary between literary and popular culture, and showcases an impressive breadth of literature, including songs, drama, and ballads. Familiar texts such as the visions of Margery Kempe and the Paston family letters are featured alongside lesser-known works, often oral. This striking diversity extends to the language: the anthology includes Scottish literature and original translations of Latin and French texts.  The illuminating introduction offers essential information that will enhance the reader’s enjoyment of the chosen texts. Each of the chapters is accompanied by a clear summary explaining the particular delights of the literature selected and the rationale behind the choices made. An invaluable resource to gain an in-depth understanding of the culture of the period, this is essential reading for any student or scholar of medieval English literature, and for anyone interested in folklore or popular material of the time.    The book was left unfinished at Gray's death; it is here edited by Jane Bliss.    The Faculty of English, University of Oxford, has generously contributed to this publication.""

The collector of bodies,Diane Glancy,poetry,First published in 2016,/works/OL19714681W,/authors/OL22981A/Diane_Glancy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 86,"A 1994 trip to Syria and Jordan as an Arts America Speaker for the United States Information Agency began the group of poems for The Collector of Bodies. The manuscript stayed in a file until the Civil War began in Syria, March 18, 2011, the author's 70th birthday. The poems were retrieved, and the manuscript continued. Glancy wrote as an observer--as someone who had talked to the students in the universities--who had experienced a foreboding of what was ahead for Syria, especially after listening to the unrest of the students. In the bright sunlight, as they walked toward her, smiling, she felt an inexplicable point of grief. She heard the desire of the people to be free. Later, following the uprising of civil war on the news, she knew she was seeing the price the Syrians would pay for that desire. A visit to a foreign country leaves part of oneself in that place. But something in return is taken. This collection of poems explores the ""something that is taken"" with implications for the Christian believer and the issues involved. What can be done in a world full of refugees? Is there anything to do other than stand back and watch? -- back cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

She was a musical genius who devoted her life to composing and performing songs. Of the nine books of lyrics Sappho is said to have composed, none of the music is extant and only one poem has survived complete. All the rest are fragments. In If Not, Winter Carson presents all of Sappho's fragments in Greek and in English. Brackets and space give the reader a sense of what is absent as well as what is present on the papyrus. Carson's translation illuminates Sappho's reflections on love, desire, marriage, exile, cushions, bees, old age, shame, time, chickpeas and many other aspects of the human situation.From the Hardcover edition.

Marriage, family, home all come crashing down, but Todd Boss rebuilds with his trademark musicality and ""a reverent gusto for representing the tactile aspects of human life"" (Tony Hoagland).From ""In the End a Gardener"":is what we want in our corner of paradise.

There is a wide range of pastoral lyrics, weightier allusive pieces, and translations from classical and vernacular pastoral poetry; also, more unusually, pastoral ballads and poems set in all kinds of prose works. Each piece has been freshly edited from the original sources, with full apparatus and commentary.

Arabic|Pages 369,"ديوان القرن السابع:  هجرة القوافي العربية إلى ضفتي البحر المتوسط د. نضير الخزرجي  تختلف الأغراض الشعرية وتتنوع مقاصده من جيل الى آخر ومن حقبة الى أخرى، ويترك النظام السياسي الحاكم أثره الكبير في عناوين الشعر ومساحاته وفضاءاته، كما يترك الزمن بصماته على الشعر فيتلمسه بحنان او ينشب أظافره فيه، فترى البعض من الشعراء اذا ما هوى نظام وقام آخر، صرعى على مذبح السلطان يسبح بدمائه يقدم ضريبة الولاء للسابق ورفض اللاحق، وبعضهم يتلون مع صبغة النظام يتحرك حيثما هبت الريح وحيثما حطت الأمور رحالها، يتبضع بقوافيه يملأ جيوبه من صفراء هذا النظام وبيضاء ذاك النظام، فهو في كل واد يهيم، لا يهمه اهتزاز عرش قوافيه ما سلم معاشه، وإنْ كان بذلك تثبيت عرش سلطان جائر، فليس كل شاعر دعبل بن علي الخزاعي (ت 246هـ) يحمل على ظهره خشبته ينتظر نصف قرن من يصلبه عليها بتهمة الولاء للحق والتغني بقوافي الحرية.    ولعل القرن السابع الهجري يشكل علامة بارزة في تاريخ الأدب العربي بعامة والقريض منه بخاصة، لاسيما وإنه شهد سقوط دول ودويلات وقيام أخرى على أنقاضها، ومن الطبيعي وفي هذه الأجواء الحساسة المليئة بالمفاجآت أن يسطع نجم شاعر ويأفل نجم آخر، وهجرة الشعر وانتقال الشعراء الى بلدان أخرى. وهذا ما يحاول أنْ يثيره الدكتور الشيخ محمد صادق الكرباسي في كتابه ""ديوان القرن السابع"" الخاص بالمنظوم في الامام الحسين (ع) من الشعر القريض، والصادر في لندن عن المركز الحسيني للدراسات، في 365 صفحة من القطع الوزيري.  • اهتزاز عرش القوافي    فسنوات القرن السابع الهجري (29/8/1204- 5/9/1301م)، كانت حبلى بالحوادث والوقائع، حيث انقرضت الدولة الأيوبية في مصر (647 هـ)، والدولة العباسية في بغداد (656 هـ) والدولة الزنكية في الموصل (657 هـ) والدولة الموحدية في تونس (667 هـ). وفي المقابل قامت الدولة الحفصية في تونس (627 هـ) ودولة بني الأحمر الخزرجية في الأندلس (635 هـ) ودولة المماليك البحرية في مصر (648 هـ)، والدولة المغولية الإيلخانية في ايران (649 هـ) التي قامت على أنقاض الدولة الخوارزمشاهية، والدولة العباسية الثانية في مصر (659 هـ)، وقيام الدولة العثمانية في الأناضول (680 هـ) على أنقاض الدولة السلجوقية، وغير ذلك من الحوادث والكوارث التي حلت بالمسلمين.    ويوعز المحقق الكرباسي انحسار موجة الأدب في القرن السابع الهجري الى أسباب عدة، أهمها:    أولا: كثرة الحوادث والفتن التي أنهكت قوى المسلمين في سائر الأقطار الاسلامية.    ثانيا: زيادة الكوارث الطبيعية والأمراض الفتاكة التي أدت الى شيوع القحط والغلاء.    ثالثا: اهتمام المماليك البحرية في مصر بالفن والعمران والبناء أكثر من اهتمامهم بالأدب والشعر.    رابعا: انتقال العاصمة الاسلامية من بغداد الى الأناضول ثم استانبول، ما أدى الى توزع الحواضر العلمية والأدبية.    خامسا: انتشار أدب النثر والتأليف والتصنيف وفن القصص كبديل عن الشعر، ما ساعد على انحسار رقعة الشعر. لكنه في الوقت نفسه يلاحظ انتشار فن الموشحات والمقامات، على أنَّ ابتعاد الحكام من التتر والمماليك والعثمانيين عن اللغة العربية الأثر المساعد في انحدار الشعر عن مكانته الأدبية والسياسية.    وخلاصة الأمر إنَّ عرش القوافي أصابه الاهتزاز بسبب ضعف قوائمه وعدم إسناد الأسر الحاكمة للشعر ودعم الشعراء، وعزوف بعضها عن الأدب العربي لأنها جاءت من محيط غير عربي، وانشغال بعضها بالحروب الداخلية بين دوائر العائلة الحاكمة الواحدة.  • قوافي العرب في الأندلس    كانت الطلائع الأولى التي فتحت الأندلس عام 92هـ قادمة من العراق، وهذه الطلائع فيها الى جانب العسكر رجال أدب وثقافة، وكان لهم الدور الكبير في انتشار الأدب العربي في البلدان الأوروبية التي بدأت تفتح الواحدة بعد الأخرى حتى سيطرة الأسبان على الأندلس في العام 898هـ، ومن ذلك الأدب الحسيني الذي يبث في النفوس روح التحدي والاستشهاد من أجل سلامة الأهداف السامية والقيم العالية.    وبناءاً على رأي المؤرخين فإنَّ الأدب العربي في الأندلس شهد تطورا على حكم الأمويين (138-316 هـ)، وتراوح مكانه تحت حكم المروانيين في الأندلس (216-422 هـ)، وبدأ يشرئب بعنقه ويزدهر في عصر ملوك الطوائف (422-484 هـ)، وفي الجانب الآخر من البحر الأبيض المتوسط إزدهر الأدب في شمال أفريقية أيام حكم الأدارسة (172-363 هـ) واستمر في أيام الفاطميين (291-555 هـ).    ويرى المحقق الكرباسي أنَّه: ""وفي ظل حكومة ملوك الطوائف وبفضل دولة بني حمود (407-449 هـ) ظهر التشيع في الأندلس بعدما كان فاشيا في أفريقية في عهد الأدارسة والفاطميين واستمر الأمر على هذه الحالة على عهد دولة الموحدين (515-667 هـ) التي حكمت شمال أفريقية والأندلس أيضا، ومع ظهور التشيع وانتشاره ظهر الشعر الحسيني وانتشر في المغرب الاسلامي بشكل عام"".    ويعود الشعر الحسيني في الأندلس في بعض جذوره الى هروب عدد من الموالين بمن فيهم الشعراء من المشرق الاسلامي الى مغربه، وكان من إفرازات الهجرة ظهور انتفاضات وثورات عدة في الأندلس، كما ساعد سقوط الدولة المروانية الأموية في الأندلس وقيام دولة الحموديين على نشر فكر أهل البيت (ع) وبالتالي انتشار الأدب الحسيني بما فيه الشعر، وقبل ذلك كان الأمويون يقتلون من يوالي أهل البيت (ع)، وهذا ما يؤرخه الرحالة المقدسي محمد بن احمد (ت 380 هـ) في كتابه ""أحسن التقاسيم في معرفة الأقاليم"" حيث يؤكد في (ص 322): ""إنَّ الأندلسيين – الأمويين منهم – إذا عثروا على شيعي فربما قتلوه""، واستخدام المقدسي كلمة (عثروا) دلالة على عظم الجريمة بإشهار الشيعي ولاءه لأهل البيت في ظل حكم الأمويين!    ويرى البعض كما يشير الكرباسي: ""إنَّ من أسباب دخول التشيع في الأندلس بل جميع بلاد المغرب العربي هو رحلة عدد من الأندلسيين الى المشرق الاسلامي ويعتبرون الأعشى القرطبي المتوفى عام 221 هـ من أوائلهم فقد رحل عام 179 الى العراق المركز الشيعي ثم رحل بعده عباس الثقفي (ت 238 هـ) الذي أوفده عبد الرحمان الأوسط (176-238 هـ) عام 201 هـ في التماس الكتب القديمة"". ورويدا رويدا أخذ الناس بالأندلس في إقامة مجالس العزاء في عاشوراء ذكرى استشهاد الامام الحسين (ع)، وفي هذا يقول المؤرخ عمر بن عبد الله فروخ (ت 1407 هـ) في تاريخ الأدب العربي: 6/130، وهو يتحدث عن الأدب في الأندلس والمغرب: ""من المناسبات التي كان أهل الأندلس والمغرب يحتفلون بها ذكرى عاشوراء التي كانت بها مأساة عاشوراء ومقتل الحسين بن علي رضي الله عنه"".    ولا خصوصية للأدب الحسيني في المغرب الاسلامي عما كان عليه في المنشأ في المشرق الاسلامي، كما يذهب بذلك الشيخ الكرباسي، ولم يختلف الاتجاه الأدبي كما: ""إنَّ الأغراض الشعرية ظلت كما هي ولم تتغير بشكل عام ويعترف الجميع بأنَّ الشعر بالذات وصل أوجه في الأندلس في عصر المماليك وبسقوطهم انحط الشعر انحطاطا كبيرا لابتعاد المرابطين – البربر- عن العربية، وفي شمال أفريقيا وصل الشعر أوجه بعد المرابطين حين وصل الموحدون الى السلطة وكان للشعر الحسيني بالذات أرضية خصبة"".  • أسماء لامعة    ومع ان الأدب العربي بعامة والحسيني بخاصة أصابه ما أصاب الوضع السياسي من مد وجزر، نتيجة: ""الأوضاع المتردية في مجمل الأقطار الإسلامية وبالأخص تلك الاضطرابات التي هزت القلب والمناطق الوسطى من الخارطة الإسلامية""، فإنَّ الشعر الحسيني ظل: ""ينشد من هنا وهناك وصوته يدوي في أرجاء الديار الإسلامية""، وفي الوقت نفسه فان ما يلاحظ على الشعر الحسيني في هذا القرن أنَّ الشعر القادم من المغرب الإسلامي فاق الشعر المنظوم في المشرق الإسلامي، حيث: ""بلغ مجموع من وصلنا اسمه من الشعراء الحسينيين من بلاد المغرب الإسلامي في هذا القرن ستة وعشرون شاعرا وهو كبير في قبال شعراء العراق البالغ عددهم أربعة عشر شاعرا وشعراء مصر البالغ عددهم ثمانية ومثلها من شعراء الشام بغض النظر عن سائر الشعراء"".    ولاحظ المصنف أنَّ القرن السابع الهجري شهد تنوعا فريدا في وظائف الشعراء وجنسياتهم، إذ كان فيهم الفقيه والقاضي والأمير والوزير والرحالة والكاتب والأديب توزعوا على اسبانيا وإيران والبرتغال وتونس والجزائر والجزيرة العربية وسوريا والعراق وفلسطين وليبيا ومصر والمغرب واليمن وغيرها. فيشار بالبنان الى القاضي السعيد ابن سناء الملك هبة الله بن جعفر السعدي (ت 608هـ) وهو من خريجي مدرسة أبي تمام حبيب بن أوس الطائي (ت 231 هـ) وأبي الطيب المتنبي أحمد بن الحسين (ت 354 هـ): ""وقالوا بأنه أشهر وأجود من نظم من المشارقة في الموشحات وكان صاحب نظرية موسيقية فيها"". ومن شعره الحسيني قوله في قصيدة أنشأها في مدح القاضي الفاضل عبد الرحيم بن علي اللخمي (ت 596 هـ)، من الشعر المتقارب ومطلعها:    مديحك كالمسك لا يكتتم  به يبتدى وبه يختتم    ثم يقول:    وما ضيّع اللهُ آل الحسينِ  إذا رفع الدهرُ آل الحَكَم    فالشاعر يحاول أنْ يخفف عن القاضي الفاضل تخليه عن القضاء والوزارة في الدولة الأيوبية، فيجري مقارنة بين آل الحسين وآل الحكم، حيث رفع الله الأسرة الأولى وان بان ان الدهر رفع الثانية.    ويشار الى الأمير العيوني علي بن المقرب (ت 629هـ) وهو من خريجي مدرسة أبي تمام والمتنبي والنابغة زياد بن معاوية الذبياني (ت 18 ق هـ)، وهو صاحب القصيدة العينية من 87 بيتا في رثاء الإمام الحسين، يقول من الرجز التام ومطلعها:    يا باكيا لدِمنةٍ وأربُعِ  إبكِ على آل النبيّ أو دَعِ    ثم يقول:    وإنّ حُزني لقتيلِ كربلا  ليس على طول المدى بمُقلِعِ    إذا ذكرتُ يومَهُ تحدّرت  مدامعي لأربَـعٍ في أربَـعِ    ويشار الى الحكيم المتكلم ابن أبي الحديد عبد الحميد بن محمد المدائني المعتزلي (ت 656 هـ)، وهو صاحب شرح نهج البلاغة، وصاحب القصيدة العلوية وهي واحدة من سبع قصائد سميت بالقصائد العلويات السبع، يقول فيها من الطويل في مدح الإمام علي (ع) ثم يأتي على واقعة كربلاء، ومطلعها:    لمن ظعن بين الغميم فحاجر  بزغن شموساً في ظلام الدياجر    الى ان يصل مورد الشاهد، فيقول:    فيا لك مقتولاً تهدّمتِ العلى  وثُلّت به أركانُ عرشِ المفاخر    ثم يقول:    أما كان في رُزء ابن فاطمَ مُقتَضٍ  هبوطَ رواسٍٍ أو كُسوفَ زواهرِ    ولكنما غـدرُ النفوس سجيـةٌ  لها وعزيزٌ صاحبُ غـيرُ غـادرِ    ويشار الى الإمام البوصيري محمد بن سعيد (ت 694 هـ) صاحب البردة الميمية في مدح النبي محمد (ص). وفي قصيدة له في مدح السيدة نفيسة بنت الحسن الأنور بن زيد الأبلج بن الإمام الحسن (ع) (ت 208هـ)، ينشد من الطويل ويعرج فيها على الإمام الحسين (ع) وأهل بيته، ومطلعها:    جنابُك منه تستفيد الفوائد  وللناس بالإحسان منك عوائد    ثم يقول:    وطُفِّفَ يومَ الطّفِّ كيلُ ذمائكم  إذا الدمُّ جارٍ فيه والدمعُ جامدُ    ويلاحظ أنَّ الفقيه والشاعر الشيخ ابن نما جعفر بن محمد الربعي الحلي (ت 680 هـ) قد استأثر بتسع عشرة قصيدة وقطعة وبيت من مجموع 94 قطعة من بين 52 شخصاً ضمهم ديوان القرن السابع الهجري. ومن قصيدة له من الطويل ينعى ديار آل رسول الله (ص) وقد خلت من ساكنيها، فينشد:    وقفتُ على دار النـبيّ محمدٍ  فألفـيتُها قد أقفرت عرصاتها    وأمست خلاءً من تلاوةِ قارئٍ  وعُطّلَ فيها صومُها وصلاتُها    إلى أنْ يقول:    فعيني لقتل السبطِ عبرى ولوعتي  على فقدهم ما تنقضي زَفَراتها    فيا كبدي كم تصبرين على الأذى  أما آن أن يُغني إذاً حسراتُها    ومن المفارقات أنَّ الشيخ ابن نما صاحب كتاب ""مثير الأحزان"" والذي مات على الولاء لأهل البيت، دفع ضريبة هذا الولاء ليس في حياته فحسب، بل وحتى وهو ثاويا في لحده، فقد تعرض قبره في الحلة بتاريخ 13/8/2005م الى عملية تخريبية لغرض هدمه، أدى العمل الإرهابي الى سقوط عشرين مواطنا عراقيا بين قتيل وجريح.  • ظاهرة الشعر الملمع    ويسجل الدكتور الكرباسي ظاهرة طرأت على الشعر العربي القريض في القرن السابع الهجري على يد الشاعر الفارسي جلال الدين الرومي محمد بن محمد البلخي (611-672هـ) بخاصة، وإنْ كانت بذورها غرست في القرن السادس الهجري، وهو ظهور ""الشعر الملمع"" المتضمن لمقاطع من الشعر غير العربي يرد فيه شطر أو بيت من الشعر العربي، وهذا النمط من الشعر: ""ظهر من جراء اختلاط المسلمين من قوميات شتى بعضهم بالبعض الآخر نتيجة الفتوحات الإسلامية وأخذوا شيئا فشيئا يستخدمون المفردات العربية في النثر والشعر"".    ومثال ذلك قول الرومي:    راح بفيـها والـروح فيـها  كي أشتـهيها قم فاسقنيها    إين راز يارست إين ناز يارست  أواز يارست قم فاسقنيها    أي: (هذا سر الحبيب، هذا دلال الحبيب، نداء الحبيب قم فاسقنيها).    ولأنَّ الأدب الحسيني دخل في كل ثقافات الشعوب الداخلة في الإسلام، فان هذه الظاهرة شملته وبخاصة لدى الفرس والأتراك والهنود، وأصبحت هذه الظاهرة سائدة في النظم، ومثال ذلك:    شيعتي ما إن شربتم  عذب ماء فاذكروني    أو سمعتـم بقتـيل  أو شهيد فاندبـوني    مَن شهيـد كربلايم سَر بُريـده أز قفايم    أي: (أنا شهيد كربلا، مقطوع الرأس من القفا)، حيث يحكي الشاعر الفارسي على لسان الإمام الحسين (ع)، وما حلّ به، أما البيتان الأولان فمنسوبان للإمام الحسين (ع).  • يوم الشهيد العالمي    تتخذ الأمم المتحضرة أياما في السنة للاحتفال بمناسبة أو مناسبات معينة تحتفل بها لتخليد ذكرى حدث أو شخص، وكلما مرت السنين تجددت الذكرى، ولعل من أهم أغراض الاحتفال هو تخليد الذكرى تأسيا بها إن كانت تحمل معها بذور آمالها أو منعا لحصول أمثالها أنْ كانت ذكرى تحمل معها بذور آلامها، ولا ذكرى أعظم من ذكرى عاشوراء، لتخليد يوم الشهيد العالمي، حيث لا يوم كيوم أبي عبد الله الحسين (ع) استشهد فيه وأهل بيته وأصحابه.    ومنذ زمن بعيد نادى الأحرار بتخليد الشهيد يوم عاشوراء من كل عام، للاحتفاء بشهداء البشرية ولمنع تجدد نزيف الدماء، وتبارى الشعراء الى تخليد هذا اليوم ومطالبة العالم بتخليده وتكريم الشهيد، ومن ذلك نداء الشاعر السوري كمال العباسي المتوفى بعد العام 656 هـ ينشد من الطويل قائلا في عزاء سيف الدين علي بن عمر المشد المتوفى في المحرم عام 656 هـ والمدفون بسفح جبل قاسيون:    أيا يوم عاشورا جعلت مصيبة  لفقد كريم أو عظيم مبجل    وقد كان في قتل الحسين كفايةٌ  فقد جاءَ الرزء المعظّم في علي    وهذا اليوم الكبير الذي قال فيه فقيه الحنفية وشاعرها محمد بن عبد المنعم التنوخي المتوفى عام 669 هـ، في قصيدة من الكامل في نعي سيف الدين علي بن عمر المشد، ومطلعها:    أأخي أي دجنة أو أزمة  كانت بغير السيف عنا تنجلي    الى ان يصل مورد الشاهد:    عاشورُ يومٌ قد تعاظَمَ ذنبُـهُ  إذ حلَّ فيه كل خطب معضل    لم يكفه قتل الحسين وما جرى حتى تعدّى بالمصاب على علي    من هنا فان الفقيه آية الله الشيخ محمد صادق الكرباسي الذي انفرد في عصرنا بتتبع آثار النهضة الحسينية يرى أنَّ يوم العاشر من محرم الحرام هو رمز للشهادة وهو يوم المصائب، ولذلك فان: ""من الإنصاف أن يتخذ هذا اليوم يوما عالمياً لتكريم الشهيد من اجل الحق، فلولا شهادة طلاب الحق لما قامت للإنسانية قائمة ولا بقيت للكرامة مصداقية"".  • تشبيهات كربلائية    ولأن مصاب الإمام الحسين (ع) لا يعلوه مصاب، فهو مصاب الإنسانية جمعاء، فان كل إنسان على وجه الأرض صاحب مصاب وعزاء، يحاول أن يقترب من مصاب الحسين بان يجعل ما حلّ به من مصاب يناظر مصاب الإمام الحسين (ع)، وهذا المعنى يظهر بجلاء في شعر الرثاء، على ان صاحب المصاب مهما علا شأنه وارتفع كعب مقامه، لا يمكن قياس مصابه بمصاب الحسين (ع) ابدا، ولكنها مقاربة رثائية تجري على لسان الشاعر لبيان عظم المصاب وخطره.    فهذا الشاعر عبد الرحمان بن إسماعيل المقدسي (ت 665 هـ) يرثي الملك الكامل محمد بن غازي الذي قطع التتر رأسه ومن معه سنة 658 هـ بعد ان استولوا على الشام، وطافوا برأسه في الأزقة ثم دفن في مسجد الرأس الشريف في دمشق، فينشد من الخفيف:    ابن غازٍ غزا وجاهدَ قوماً  أثخنوا في العراق والمشرِقَين    ثم يقول:    لم يَشِنهُ إذ طـيفَ بالرأس منـه  فله أسوةُ بـرأس الحسينِ    وافق السبطَ في الشهادة والحمـ  ـل لقد حاز أجره مرتين    وهذا الشاعر ابن الساعاتي علي بن رستم الخراساني (ت 604 هـ)، يرثي فقد ولده محمود، فيقول في قصيدة من الكامل ومطلعها:    لا تنكري سقمي ولا تسهيدي  أبلى جديد الدهر كل جديد    الى أن يقول:    ولكلّ حَيٍّ أسـوةٌ بمحـمدٍ  ومحمدٌ ذو الموقف المحمود    كم في مصارع آله من عبرةٍ  سوداءَ عدّوها من التسويد    فتأسَّ بالمأموم والمسموم والـ  ـمقتول والمجلوب نحو يزيد    فالمأموم إشارة الى الإمام علي (ع) حيث أصبح مأموما بصرف الخلافة عنه وهو الإمام بنص الغدير، والمسموم إشارة الى الإمام الحسن (ع) الذي مات بالسم، والمقتول إشارة الى الإمام الحسين الشهيد بكربلاء، والمجلوب إشارة الى الإمام علي بن الحسين السجاد الذي جلب مأسورا الى الشام مع رحل الإمام الحسين (ع).    ويستقرئ المحقق الكرباسي من جملة قصائد ومتابعة للتراث الإسلامي، أن التأسي بمصاب الحسين (ع) أصبح سنة في المجتمعات المسلمة: ""ولعل هذه هي بداية لترسيخ العادة المتبعة عند الموالين لأهل البيت (ع) في التذكير بمصاب سيد الشهداء عند مصابهم والتي تحولت فيما بعد الى قراءة سيرة الإمام الحسين (ع) في مجالس العزاء على أمواتهم والتي تطورت أيضا الى تخصيص قراءة مقتل علي الأكبر - نجل الإمام الحسين – مثلا فيما إذا كان المتوفى شابا والى ذكر مصائب السيدة زينب (ع) مثلا فيما إذا كانت المتوفاة امرأة وهلمجرا"".    ولأن الاستشهاد في سبيل القيم النبيلة شهادة عالمية لا تختص بدولة أو فئة، فان عاشوراء لا تختص بالشيعي أو السني ولا تختص بالمسلم أو بغيره، وهذه الحقيقة يؤكدها الشعراء، فهذا هبة الله ابن سناء الملك بن جعفر السعدي (ت 608 هـ) يقول في قصيدة من مجزوء الكامل ومطلعها:    جاءت بحسنٍ مطمئن  جاءَت منه بكل فن    الى ان يقول:    ونظمتُها في يوم عا  شوراءَ مِن همّي وحُزني    يومٌ يناسب غَبنَ مَن  قتلوهُ ظلما مثل غَبني    يومٌ يُساءُ به وفيـ  ـه كُلُّ شيعيٍّ وسُنّي  • أدب شجي    ودرج المحقق الكرباسي كما في كل نتاجاته على تضمين الكتاب بعشرات الفهارس في أبواب شتى، ويختمه بقراءة نقدية لواحد من الأعلام، وفي هذا الديوان قراءة للأديب والمؤرخ العراقي، مير شاؤول البصري (1911-2006م)، رئيس اللجنة الإدارية ليهود العراق ورئيس الطائفة الموسوية، صاحب المؤلفات الكثيرة منها: أعلام الأدب في العراق الحديث، وأعلام الوطنية والقومية العربية، وأعلام الكرد، وهو الى ذلك له دواوين شعر. يقول البصري في قراءته إنَّ الموسوعة الحسينية في جانب منها: ""تتناول مناحي أدبية وتاريخية مختلفة، وتجلو صفحات كانت مجهولة من التراجم والآثار والأشعار والأخبار""، ورأى أنَّ الأدب الحسيني التي تهتم بها دائرة المعارف الحسينية هو: ""أدب إنساني شجي يخلّد فاجعة كربلاء التي تردّد ذكرها على مرّ العصور رمزاً للحرية والفداء، قلّما نجد في الآداب العالمية مثالاً لهذا الأدب الذي ارتفعت أصواته من فوق المنابر ورهنت آياته في بطون الكتب وظلّ حيّاً في الصدور وعلى الألسنة مئات الأجيال يثير الشجون ويبكي العيون"". وعنده: ""إنَّ كربلاء كانت ولا تزال مركزا ثقافيا إسلاميا تعاقبت عليها العهود""، مثنيا في الوقت نفسه: ""على جهود الأستاذ الشيخ محمد صادق محمد الكرباسي وتحقيقاته الرائعة المفيدة، وأرجو له مواصلة التوفيق في دائرة معارفه ومساعيه الأدبية الجميلة"".

Describing this bilingual volume as ""a laboratory in which a very interesting experiment has been carried out,"" Gonzalez-Gerth writes in both Spanish and English and moves deftly between the two languages, creating a voice both cosmopolitan and intensely Latin American. These poems offer the reader a world of oceanic beauty, an enchanting seascape of mermaids and shipwrecks, sirens and seabirds. Playful and profound in turns, Looking for the Horse Latitudes is a welcome contribution to this outstanding poet's body of work, and an important addition to any poetry collection.

Not softened, but more inspired by love, celebration, memories and even nostalgia. She aims her intimate and sparing words at family and friends, the deaths of heroes and friends, favorite meals and candy, nature, libraries, and theatre. But in between, the deep and edgy conscience that has defined her for decades shines through when she writes about Rosa Parks, hurricane Katrina, and Emmett Till's disappearance, leaving no doubt that Nikki has not traded one approach for another, but simply made room for both.

Jericho Brown worked as the speechwriter for the mayor of New Orleans before earning his PhD in creative writing and literature from the University of Houston.

Strict Wildness,Peter Viereck,poetry,First published in 2008,/works/OL8062735W,/authors/OL2685223A/Peter_Viereck,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL10936664M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""A reviewer once called Peter Viereck's thought ""not common sense but inspired, electric common sense."" This volume of Viereck's selected essays on poetry and on history, written between 1938 through 2004, exemplifies this quality. Its main theme is suggested in Viereck's coined phrase ""strict wildness,"" which suggests a balance between restraint (which by itself is staid and rigid) and passion (which by itself is incoherent). Frost called free verse tennis without the net. Viereck calls dead mechanical form ""net without the tennis."" Strict wildness, then, is spontaneity of feeling within strict organic form. The book explores questions of modernism and poetic craft with respect to American poetry. It discusses the controversy over Ezra Pound's politics and its relation to his poetics, as well as the nearly forgotten poet Vachel Lindsay. Viereck offers more general views on poetics, including the fruitful tensions between form and content, and the impact of modern technology on poetic expression. He also discusses history and politics, and contains essays on McCarthyism, the Cold War, political conformity of the Left and Right, and discusses issues of historiography and culture that define Viereck's highly individual, often critical brand of conservatism. In treating representative trends and figures in conservative thought, Viereck insists on clear awareness of what exists to conserve, what ought to be conserved, and why it should be conserved. In their range and originality, the writings brought together in Strict Wildness constitute an ideal introduction to Peter Viereck's literary and political thought and how they come together. It will be of interest to literary scholars, intellectual historians, and social scientists. The introduction allows the reader to grasp a clear sense of the context and background of Viereck's works.""--Provided by publisher.

Siken writes with ferocity, and his reader hurtles unstoppably with him. His poetry is confessional, gay, savage, and charged with violent eroticism. In the world of American poetry, Siken's voice is striking.  In her introduction to the book, competition judge Louise Glück hails the ""cumulative, driving, apocalyptic power, [and] purgatorial recklessness"" of Siken's poems. She notes, ""Books of this kind dream big. . . . They restore to poetry that sense of crucial moment and crucial utterance which may indeed be the great genius of the form.""

Earth and sky, neighborhood life and ancient myths, the art of seeing and the architecture of the imagination are all among the subjects of these poems. Recurring images and ideas construct a complex picture of our world, ourselves, and the manifold connections tying them together. The poems raise large questions about the natural world and our place in it, and they do not flinch from facing up to those questions.  Roberson's poems range widely through different scales of time and space, invoking along the way history and myth, galaxies and garbage trucks, teapots and the history of photography, mating cranes and Chicago's political machine. This collection is composed of five sequences, each developing a particular constellation of images and ideas related to the vision of the whole. Various journeys become one journey—an epic journey, invoking epic themes. There are songs of creation, pictures of the sorrows of war, celebrations of human labor and human society, a respect for tools and domestic utensils that are well made, the deep background of the past tingeing the colors of the present, and the tragic tones of endings and laments, a pervading awareness of the tears in things. Most of all, there is the exhilaration of a grand, sweeping vision that enlarges our world.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Using simple, understandable language,"" notes USA Today, the two-term U.S. Poet Laureate ""captures ordinary life--its pleasure, its discontents, its moments of sadness and of joy."" His everyman approach to writing resonates with readers everywhere and generates fans who would otherwise never give a poem a second glance.Now, in this stunning new collection, Collins touches on a greater array of subjects--love, death, solitude, youth, and aging--delving deeper than ever before. Ballistics comes at the reader full force with moving and playful takes on life. Drawing inspiration from the world around him and from such poetic forebears as Robert Frost, Paul Valery, and eleventh-century poet Liu Yung, Collins drolly captures the essence of an ordinary afternoon: All I do these drawn-out daysis sit in my kitchen at Pheasant Ridgewhere there are no pheasants to be seenand, last time I looked, no ridge.Collins reflects on his solitude:If I lived across the street from myselfand I was sitting in the darkon the edge of the bedat five o'clock in the morning,I might be wondering what the lightwas doing on in my study at this hour.And he meditates on the effects of love:It turns everything into a symbollike a storm that breaks loosein the final chapter of a long novel.And it may add sparkle to a morning,or deepen a night when the bed is ringed with fire.As Collins strives to find truth in the smallest detail, readers are given a fascinating, intimate glimpse into the heart and soul of a brilliantly thoughtful man and exemplary poet.From the Hardcover edition.

Traveling deeper and deeper, she is on a journey of continual transformation, encountering a series of figures and undergoing fragmentations and metamorphoses as she seeks to confront the Tyrant and heal the world. Using a new measure, with rhythmic units indicated by quotation marks, Notley has created a ""spoken"" text, a rich and mesmerizing work of imagination, mystery, and power.

In addressing these themes, the poems also raise questions about art, politics, citizenship, and moral responsibility.

During the War of the Seven Against Thebes, Antigone learns that her brothers have killed each other, having been forced onto opposing sides. When Creon, king of Thebes, grants burial of one but not the ""treacherous"" other, Antigone defies his order, believing it her duty to bury all of her close kin. Enraged, Creon condemns her to death, and his soldiers wall her up in a tomb. In this new translation, Seamus Heaney exposes the darkness and the humanity in Sophocles' masterpiece, and inks it with his own modern and masterly touch.

A nation convulses: ""Every song of this country / has an unsung third stanza, something brutal."" And still Limón shows us, as ever, the persistence of hunger, love, and joy, the dizzying fullness of our too-short lives. ""Fine then, / I'll take it,"" she writes. ""I'll take it all."" In Bright Dead Things, Limón showed us a heart ""giant with power, heavy with blood""--""the huge beating genius machine / that thinks, no, it knows, / it's going to come in first."" In her follow-up collection, that heart is on full display--even as The Carrying continues further and deeper into the bloodstream, following the hard-won truth of what it means to live in an imperfect world.""--Publisher's website.

S. Eliot's work demands much from his readers. The more the reader knows about his allusions and range of cultural reference, the more rewarding his poems, essays and plays are. This book is carefully designed to provide an authoritative and coherent examination of those contexts essential to the fullest understanding of his challenging and controversial body of work. It explores a broad range of subjects relating to Eliot's life and career; key literary, intellectual, social and historical contexts; as well as the critical reception of his oeuvre. Taken together, these chapters sharpen critical appreciation of Eliot's writings and present a comprehensive, composite portrait of one of the twentieth century's pre-eminent men of letters. Drawing on original research, T. S. Eliot in Context is a timely contribution to an exciting reassessment of Eliot's life and works, and will provide a valuable resource for scholars, teachers, students and general readers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

All of the poems here, whether sonnet, mesostic, or deconstructed blues, exhibit a formal flair. They speak to the changes we have experienced as a society in the last few decades—changes that often challenge our past strategies for resisting racism and, for African Americans, ways of relating to one another. The poems embrace a formal ambiguity that echoes the uncertainty these shifts produce, while reveling in language play that enables readers to “laugh to keep from crying.” They move through nostalgia, even as they insist on being alive to the present and point longingly towards possible futures.

There is no removing the stain Of it say moms everywhere & Even if kids choose it last; They choose it, as loyal To its sugar as any....""  When authorities converged on the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, known as Jonestown, in Guyana on November 18, 1978, more than 900 members were found dead, the result of murder-suicide. The massacre, led by cult leader James ""Jim"" Jones, was the largest mass loss of American lives before September 11, 2001. Yet this event is largely absent in American history. When the mass suicides are remembered, it is usually comically or instructively: ""Don't drink the Kool-Aid,"" as the majority of those who died that day drank or were injected with grape flavored Flavor-Aid.  Much has been documented about this tragic day and how the congregants were killed, yet little is written about the individuals and their lived experiences. In this profound and provocative poetry collection, darlene anita scott corrects that which has been disremembered and honors the people who perished. She elevates and gives voice to the children, teenagers, and adults whose hopes, dreams, and lives were just as hopeful and mundane as any others yet have been overlooked and overshadowed by the other focuses of history. The distinct, haunting, and unforgettable poems in Marrow cut to the bone while also acknowledging and giving tribute to those who died on that fateful day.

The preserved corpus of these texts is characterised by a rather uniform language and many recurring themes, thus making the establishment of chronological priorities a difficult task. The editors have brought together scholars working on these texts from both a linguistic and a literary perspective to address the problem. Some contributions offer statistical analysis of the linguistic material or linguistic analysis of subgenres within epic, others use a neoanalytical approach to the history of epic themes or otherwise seek to track the development and interrelationship of epic contents. All the contributors focus on the implications of their study for the dating of early epic poems relative to each other. Thus the book offers an overview of the current state of discussion""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nine Gates begins with a close examination of the roots of poetic craft in ""the mind of concentration"" and concludes by exploring the writer's role in creating a sense of community that is open, inclusive and able to bind the individual and the whole in a way that allows each full self-expression. in between, Nine Gates illumines the nature of originality, translation, the various strategies by which meaning unfolds itself in language, poetry's roots in oral memory and the importance of the shadow to good art. A person who enters completely into the experience of a poem is initiated into a deeper intimacy with life. Delving into the nature of poetry, Jane Hirshfield also writes on the nature of the human mind, perception and experience. Nine Gates is about the underpinnings of poetic craft, but it is also about a way of being alive in the world -- alertly, musically, intelligently, passionately, permeably. In part a primer for the general reader, Nine Gates is also a manual for the working writer, with each ""gate"" exploring particular strategies of language and thought that allow a poem to convey meaning and emotion with clarity and force. Above all, Nine Gates is an insightful guide to the way the mind of poetry awakens our fundamental consciousness of what can be known when a person is most fully alive.

The Melancholic Gaze,Piotr Sniedziewski,poetry,First published in 2018,/works/OL23498139W,/authors/OL8908145A/Piotr_Sniedziewski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 222,"This book consists of nine chapters devoted to representations of melancholia in 19th-century art and literature. A noteworthy feature of the book is its use of concepts from later works by Sigmund Freud, Jean Clair, Jean Starobinski, Julia Kristeva and others. Those concepts elucidate further contexts of the notion of melancholia, which are presented not in isolation but juxtaposed with the philosophical background of the concept (starting from Hippocrates and Aristotle). Thus, the book not only provides a survey of images and modes of behaviour of 19th-century individuals, but also discusses the meanings of melancholia as they appeared in European culture over time.

Rich with Christian and Kuman myths and stories, the poems explore Western and tribal ways of looking at the world -- an interface of vastly different cultures and notions of spirituality, illuminated by the poet’s own struggles as he comes of age in this unique environment.  The images conjured in Mission Work are viscerally stirring: native people slaughter pigs for a Chimbu wedding ceremony; a papery flight of cicadas cuts through a cloud forest; hands sting as they beat a drum made of dried snakeskin. Quieter moments are shot through with the unfamiliar as well. In “Bird of Paradise,” a father angles his son’s head toward the canopy of the jungle so the boy can catch sight of an elusive bird.

Great poetry is a catalyst for change: a change of mind, a change of heart, a change of life- and yes, over and over, again and again, with each new reading, and each new phase of our journey.That's why poetry is dangerous. It gives voice to our unspoken dreams; it is a mirror to our own deepest joys, desires, and sorrows. It can tip us over into a new life, into a new way of seeing and being, that a moment ago we might even have had no words for.In this new volume of his Ten Poems series, Roger Housden takes ten great poems and in personal, intimate essays shows how they led him, and can also lead us, into a more deeply lived and examined life. Housden says, ""Every one of the poems in this book has struck me a blow, a direct hit, each of them, into the heart of hearts. Every one of them, in its own way, has opened a door for me to go deeper into my own experience, my own longings, my own sorrows and joys, and into the silence that surrounds all of this, all of us, always.""From the Hardcover edition.

Her Poems 1962-2012 was hailed as ""a major event in this country's literature"" in the pages of The New York Times. Every new collection is at once a deepening and a revelation. Faithful and Virtuous Night is no exception. You enter the world of this spellbinding book through one of its many dreamlike portals, and each time you enter it's the same place but it has been arranged differently. You were a woman. You were a man. This is a story of adventure, an encounter with the unknown, a knight's undaunted journey into the kingdom of death; this is a story of the world you've always known, that first primer where ""on page three a dog appeared, on page five a ball"" and every familiar facet has been made to shimmer like the contours of a dream, ""the dog float[ing] into the sky to join the ball."" Faithful and Virtuous Night tells a single story but the parts are mutable, the great sweep of its narrative mysterious and fateful, heartbreaking and charged with wonder.

In this inspiring title, poet Patricia Thomas imagines each season rendered in a different art medium. Pen and ink, with spots of color, capture winter’s mood, while pastel chalks make spring flowers bloom into life. The see-through hues of watercolors celebrate summer’s warmth, while vibrant oils perfectly paint fall’s majestic scenes. Artist Craig Orback takes up the poem’s challenge in his marvelous illustrations, using each of the mediums described. Just as the seasons move seamlessly into one another, so too do the art styles blend together, then emerge in full splendor, and blend again as the next season approaches.

In compiling this landmark anthology, Wayne Miller and Kevin Prufer enlisted twenty-four regional editors to select 270 poets whose writing was first published after 1970. These poets represent every country in Europe, and many of them are published here for the first time in English and in the United States. The resulting anthology collects some of the very best work of a new generation of poets who have come of age since Paul Celan, Anna Akhmatova, Federico García Lorca, Eugenio Montale, and Czeslaw Milosz.  The poetry in New European Poets is fiercely intelligent, often irreverent, and engaged with history and politics. The range of styles is exhilarating―from the lyric intimacy of Portuguese poet Rosa Alice Branco to the profane prose poems of Romanian poet Radu Andriescu, from the surrealist bravado of Czech poet Sylva Fischerová to the survivor's cry of Russian poet Irina Ratushinskaya. Poetry translated from more than thirty languages is represented, including French, German, Spanish, and Italian, and more regional languages such as Basque, Irish Gaelic, and Sámi.  In its scope and ambition, New European Poets is destined to be a seminal anthology, an important vehicle for American readers to discover the extraordinary poetry being written across the Atlantic.

Wilson    Arkansas Gazette    Little Rock, Arkansas    April 1990  An American Papyrus    Steven Sills    The Chestnut Hills Press Poetry Series    63 pages; $6.95 paperback  Twenty-six poems make up this first published book by Steven Sills, 26, of Fayetteville.  Sills' vision is often a dark one.  He writes of the homeless, the abused, the forgotten people.  He is also intrigued with the mystical, the sensual/sexual, loss--as in losing those whom we hold dear, such as a spouse or lover--as well as the lost, such as someone who is autistic, who seems unreachable.  Sills' skillful use of the language to impart the telling moments of a life is his strength.  He chooses his words carefully, employing a well-developed vocabulary.  He is thoughtful about punctuation, where to break lines and when to make a new stanza.  He's obviously well versed in ""great"" literature.  Sills' command of language helps to soften the blows of some of the seamier passages found in his poems.  Seamy may not be the best word to use.  Perhaps gritty is a better word or just plain matter-of-fact and to the point, as in this descriptive passage from ""Oracion A Traves De Gasshole,"" about the hopeless feelings of a respiratory therapy worker:  ""With the last of the air drawing in/ Begins to fold its walls; and he could imagine it/ Like he could imagine from inexact memories/ The woman last night at the hospital, whom he began to like---/ Her body pulling cell by cell/ Apart before he had a chance to finish the rescue with the hose.""  The book begins with ""Post-Annulment2"" a poem with a poignant description of society's displaced--""As the sun blazes upon the terminal's/ Scraped concrete/The shelved rows of the poor men""--and continues by describing a city scene through the eyes of a maintenance worker at the Hilton Hotel.  The protagonist's wife has left him and he is taking the bus to work that morning, his mind wandering as he looks for the key to why she is gone.  ""He rings the bell. / The idea of her not home and legally annulled/ From his life--her small crotch not tightened to his desperate thrusts/ Makes him feel sick.  He gets down from the bus./  He goes to work.  He suddenly knows that he is not in love.""  As many poets will do, Sills could not leave this work alone.  So a hybrid of this poem, ""Post-Annulment"" ends the book.  In it, he has kept many of the original lines and added parenthetical remarks to expand on his ideas.  It is in this context he allows himself to comment on religion:  ""Religion is a lie!  Everything is a lie!"" and on marriage:  ""Marriage, that sanctified legal rape, fosters the child-man to be a destined societal function as he grows up in the family unit.""  Not all of the poems are so bleak and cynical in every passage, however, as is apparent in ""The San Franciscan's Night Meditations"":  ""The night is full of impulses to live and run and seep heavily into its dark robes of silence and morbid rightness.""  People who do not feel comfortable examining in detail the darker side of life--the the details that the average person overlooks because it just hurts or feels to strange to look--will not enjoy this book.  Serious writers of free verse, contemporary poetry and/or those who study it will not be disappointed.  Sills, a native of Missouri, is a recent graduate of Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield.  He currently is working in Fayetteville.  Sills dedicated his book to Mike Burns, a poet and teacher at SMSU who helped him edit his work.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Life could become a summer afternoon, a slow swim in a warm lake. I could become another backyard roustabout, part of the greedy gang eying the vegetable garden. The larcenous woodchuck returns. We exchange a long gaze but he gives no clue of what to do next. The poems ponder various ways to adapt to unaccustomed leisure--napping, complaining, gardening, volunteering, and so on. Observing time's curious way of intermittently sprinting then lollygagging, and understanding more clearly every day that time doesn't exist anyway, the poet relishes moments, which are . . . liable to be caught like a leaf in the eddy of a brook, lodged only long enough to look, and which become her subjects. -- back cover.

Now, with Something Shining, his first collection of new poems in seven years, he gives us an ambitious, wide-ranging meditation on birth, love, and maturity, marking a turning point in both his life and his work. These beautifully crafted poems explore relations between lovers, between friends, between fathers and children. Written by the light of a young daughter's presence, in the distinctive lyrical language that Ted Hughes described as ""so free and effortless and unerring,"" these poems ponder the fading of the body and the struggle that consciousness wages to keep the self afloat. And into this intimate world also enter a surprising array of characters: ancient Chinese poets and modern Cuban musicians, Charlie Parker, Chekhov, and the dervish mystic Rumi. But it is the poet's awareness of his own frailty (""the days run out--no longer oneself,"" he writes in ""Fugue""), that, together with the extraordinary beauty he discovers in environments familiar and exotic, unifies this collection. The work of a poet at the top of his form, Something Shining confirms Halpern's place in our national literature.From the Trade Paperback edition.

There are no tricks and no evasive moves, nothing that in ten years she will be ashamed of or confused by. She is a poet of compassion and pity. Where it is appropriate, she is merciless, especially to herself. I love reading her poems; I love reading them over and over. I salute her""--Gerald Stern.

GROWN MEN AREN'T SUPPOSED TO CRY. But in this fascinating anthology, one hundred men - distinguished in literature and film, science and architecture, theatre and human rights - confess to being moved to tears by poems that haunt them. Representing twenty nationalities and ranging in age from their early 20s to their late 80s, the majority are public figures not prone to crying. Here they admit to breaking down when ambushed by great art, often in words as powerful as the poems themselves. Seventy-five percent of the selected poems were written in the twentieth century, with more than a dozen by women. Their themes range from love in its many guises, through mortality and loss, to the beauty and variety of nature. Three men have suffered the pain of losing a child; others are moved to tears by the exquisite way a poet captures, in Alexander Pope's famous phrase, 'what oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd'.
