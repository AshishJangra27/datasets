After a botched attempt to destroy Trash Mountain with a homemade firebomb, Ben begins a years-long infiltration that finds him dropping out of school to work alongside homeless trash-pickers, and then, finally, interning at the very place he meant to destroy. Ben's boss there, a charismatic would-be titan of sanitation, forces Ben to choose between providing for his family and sticking to his terroristic principals. With dark humor, Trash Mountain reflects on life in small southern cities in decline, and on the search for meaning among young people without adult examples.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Indeed hamsters are so randy they often have sex seventy-five times a day. We may criticise pigs for their poor hygiene but when it comes to sex they sure take home the bacon, having orgasms that last a cock-boggling thirty minutes! However, for most men the urge to find a mate and have sex is delicately counter-balanced by the overwhelming desire to sit on the sofa watching telly while eating burgers and downing copious amounts of lager. So, if this describes you, this book is the perfect read. It will tell you everything you need to know about sex from 'easy ways to meet chicks' to fun positions - and will show you how to do it all with the very minimum of effort. So, crack open another six pack, lie back comfortably and be prepared to be sexucated!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The week before he sent a message to be read out at the SIHAC live show in Bournemouth. It read: 'I'm sorry I cannot be with you this evening I'm in hospital.' There was a typically wonderful Humph pause, after which, 'I wish I had thought of this earlier.' As a tribute to this wonderful man we present Humphrey Lyttelton's Britain, a tour of this Septic (or is that Sceptred) Isle in the hands of a national treasure.The I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue team of Barry Cryer, Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor, in the company of their esteemed chairman Humphrey Lyttelton, have been recording their BBC radio show around the UK for longer than any of them can remember ... that's about a week – or twenty minutes in the case of Barry Cryer. At each venue Humph would present a short history of the location, written by Iain Pattinson, to the mutual delight of the audience, the team and their delightful scorer Samantha (who somehow always found time for a rewarding poke around the area's backstreets).We are privileged to present, in gazetteer form, the very best of Humph's local histories form Radio 4's multi award-winning 'antidote to panel games'. As accurate as Wikipedia and as comprehensive as Reader's Digest, this unique guide tells you everything you never knew you wouldn't ever need to know about the background and inhabitants of Britain's most prominent towns and cities. The intelligent reader will waste no time in adding it to their collection.BristolIt was from Bristol in 1497 that John Cabot set off to find a new route to the Spice Islands by sailing north-west. He instead discovered a strange, hostile world which he named 'Newfoundland', until the natives explained that they actually called it 'Swansea'.NottinghamIt's well documented in official records that the city's original name was 'Snottingham' or 'home of Snotts', but when the Normans came, they couldn't pronounce the initial letter 'S', so decreed the town be called 'Nottingham'or the 'home of Notts'. It's easy to understand why this change was resisted so fiercely by the people of Scunthorpe.BrightonA settlement is first recorded in Brighton as long as ago as 3000 BC, when Celtic Druids practised their ancient worship of oaks, mistletoe and virgins, and indeed, oaks and mistletoe are still plentiful in Brighton.

It's just a fact of life. Not to be confused with laziness (a reluctance to exert oneself), apathy is indifference, a lack of passion for a subject and the many advantages of being apathetic are explored in this book. Embrace your apathetic nature! Enjoy being a dilly-dallier, a fence-sitter, a procrastinator! Apathy has been around and documented since the Greeks. In fact, they first gave us the word apathy: the prefix 'a' meaning 'without' and 'pathy' meaning 'passion' or 'intense feeling'. Flip through this book and, apart from a great history of the subject, you'll read about great hobbies for the apathetic (sleeping, drinking, watching TV, shrugging, sitting looking at walls), stupid causes, ideal occupations (monarch, student, priest, customer service operator, politician) and much much more!

Moreover, would they want to...?Do you often find yourself pondering life's little conundrums? Have you ever wondered why the ocean is blue? Or why birds don't get electrocuted when perching on high-voltage power lines? Robert L. Wolke, professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh and acclaimed author of What Einstein Didn't Know, understands the need to...well, understand. Now he provides more amusing explanations of such everyday phenomena as gravity (If you're in a falling elevator, will jumping at the last instant save your life?) and acoustics (Why does a whip make such a loud cracking noise?), along with amazing facts, belly-up-to-the-bar bets, and mind-blowing reality bites all with his trademark wit and wisdom.If you shoot a bullet into the air, can it kill somebody when it comes down? You can find out about all this and more in an astonishing compendium of the proverbial mind-boggling mysteries of the physical world we inhabit.Arranged in a question-and-answer format and grouped by subject for browsing ease, WHAT EINSTEIN TOLD HIS BARBER is for anyone who ever pondered such things as why colors fade in sunlight, what happens to the rubber from worn-out tires, what makes red-hot objects glow red, and other scientific curiosities.

Or to be told that the condemned to the guillotine won't have a last drink for fear of ""completely losing his head."" The business of death can be absurd, and nothing illustrates this better than these tales of the gruesome and frankly ridiculous ways in which a number of ill-fated unfortunates met (or failed to meet) their maker.

Ever since losing her sight six months ago, Maggie's rebellious streak has taken on a life of its own, culminating with an elaborate school prank. Maggie called it genius. The judge called it illegal. Now Maggie has a probation officer. But she isn't interested in rehabilitation, not when she's still mourning the loss of her professional-soccer dreams, and furious at her so-called friends, who lost interest in her as soon as she could no longer lead the team to victory.

Armed with wit, a pencil-thin mustache, and a cardboard sign that reads 'I'm Not Psycho', he hitchhikes across America from Baltimore to San Francisco, braving lonely roads and treacherous drivers. But who should we be more worried about, the delicate film director with genteel manners or the unsuspecting travelers transporting the Pope of Trash? Along the way, Waters fantasises about the best and worst possible scenarios: a friendly drug dealer hands over piles of cash to finance films with no questions asked, a demolition-derby driver makes a filthy sexual request in the middle of a race, a gun-toting drunk terrorizes and holds him hostage, and a Kansas vice squad entraps and throws him in jail. So what really happens when this cult legend sticks out his thumb and faces the open road? Laced with subversive humour and warm intelligence, Carsick is an unforgettable vacation with a wickedly funny companion - and a celebration of America's weird, astonishing, and generous citizens.

Johanna Stein brings to mind the unflinching honesty and compassion of Nora Ephron."" Looking for the perfect book to help you survive childbirth and parenting with your sanity intact? Look elsewhere. For Johanna Stein, parenting is an extreme sport. Her stories from the trenches may not always be shared experiences-have you ever turned a used airplane barf-bag into a puppet to calm your wailing baby?-but they will always make you laugh. Columnist Lisa Belkin advises: ""It is dangerous to read [Johanna] any place where it is inappropriate to laugh uncontrollably. It is also dangerous to read her if your bladder control is not what it once was. But once you soldier through and do read her you have made a friend-one who gets it' and makes it easier to do because she's on your team."" So, no, this book won't teach you how to deal with nipple blisters or oedipal complexes. But if you want to learn why you should never attempt to play a practical joke in the delivery room, then you're in the right place.""--  ""First off, this is not a parenting handbook. I mean it when I say that I would never be considered a Baby Whisperer. When it comes to being a parent I prefer to think of myself as an exceedingly mediocre mother, but a creative and prolific maker of mistakes. You know that expression ""it was a learning experience""? That phrase used to crawl up into my nether-regions and cause my spine to fuse, because it was my belief that people only ever used it when attempting to justify a bad choice, like the time they got the cat high, that the phrase they really should be using is not ""it was a learning experience"" but ""I really effed up big time."" But now I get it. Because, it turns out, parenthood is one, long, mother-frack'ing learning experience. Parenthood is such a drastic departure from anything you've ever done before (unless you work in an insane asylum, in which case you're familiar with what it feels like to live with young children). What this book represents is five years' worth of hard-won lessons. They are all borne of the experiences I've had, and the many, many (many) mistakes that I've had the lack-of-common-sense to have made. So no, this book won't teach you 101 Uses for a Placenta, but if you want to know what I learned after attempting to use mine as a gag gift (and very nearly dying on a grassy hillside in the process), then you're in the right place. I cannot help you in your quest to become a Supermom but I am a world-class crier who can explain in detail the value of having (and winning) a crying contest with your infant child. May my astounding mistakes--and subsequent lessons--serve as something of a guide. And with any luck, you, too, may learn to screw up in your own horribly hilarious way""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the author of the sensational bestseller I Was Told There'd Be Cake comes a new book of personal essays brimming with all the charm and wit that have earned Sloane Crosley widespread acclaim, award nominations, and an ever-growing cadre of loyal fans. In Cake readers were introduced to the foibles of Crosley's life in New York City-always teetering between the glamour of Manhattan parties, the indignity of entry-level work, and the special joy of suburban nostalgia-and to a literary voice that mixed Dorothy Parker with David Sedaris and became something all its own.Crosley still lives and works in New York City, but she's no longer the newcomer for whom a trip beyond the Upper West Side is a big adventure. She can pack up her sensibility and takes us with her to Paris, to Portugal (having picked it by spinning a globe and putting down her finger, and finally falling in with a group of Portuguese clowns), and even to Alaska, where the ""bear bells"" on her fellow bridesmaids' ponytails seemed silly until a grizzly cub dramatically intrudes. Meanwhile, back in New York, where new apartments beckon and taxi rides go awry, her sense of the city has become more layered, her relationships with friends and family more complicated.As always, Crosley's voice is fueled by the perfect witticism, buoyant optimism, flair for drama, and easy charm in the face of minor suffering or potential drudgery. But in How Did You Get This Number it has also become increasingly sophisticated, quicker and sharper to the point, more complex and lasting in the emotions it explores. And yet, Crosley remains the unfailingly hilarious young Everywoman, healthily equipped with intelligence and poise to fend off any potential mundanity in maturity.

But handsome, slick televangelist Malachi Hope has his eyes set on developing a Christian theme park on the outskirts of town; and his silken promises of miracle cures, prosperity and fame for the region draw crowds of contributing believers to his nightly laser-lit revival meetings. While most of the locals see their own dreams depicted in the Reverend's vision of Maggody's future, skeptical Arly, who spent some time in Manhattan, doesn't trust Hope, nor his entourage, including his glamourous wife and her sullen teenage sister. The girls' basketball coach is found dead in the high-school gym, a murder quickly followed by another. To track the killer, Arly goes behind the scenes of Hope's organization and into the equally daunting world of local teendom. From Brother Verber, scoping out the threat to his congregation in disguise, to the massive and newly pregnant Dahlia Buchanon, who resumes her junk-food diet after Hope says Jesus has cured her diabetes, the citizens of Maggody continue to deliver guaranteed laugh-out-loud entertainment.

He despises his negligent mother and her alcoholic boyfriend, Refrigerator Man, and he's indifferent to school and his friends -- though a little less casual about girls and marijuana. His antics have landed him in a North Virginia detention center, where nihilism, freedom, and redemption all take on unexpected guises. In a voice filled with confusion, yearning, and sardonic humor, Jacob narrates his improbably sweet romance with Andrea, an inmate with whom he shares rare glances, melodramatic conversation, and waxy cookies at rigidly chaperoned ""socials."" But when David, a mysterious, conniving adolescent, handpicks him to assist in a plot to bring about the center's demise, Jacob has to weigh the frail new optimism of his relationship with Andrea against the allure of destruction, rebellion, and escape.  In her pitch-perfect debut, Emma Rathbone adroitly captures the drama, both comic and deadly serious, of growing up.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Spending the holidays with people I want to punch in the throat,Jen Mann,humor,First published in 2015,/works/OL20018524W,/authors/OL7290443A/Jen_Mann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Ballantine Books|Language English|Pages 196,"""For fans of Laurie Notaro and Jenny Lawson comes an uproarious and oddly endearing essay collection for anyone trying to survive the holidays in one piece. When it comes to time-honored holiday traditions, Jen Mann pulls no punches In this hilariously irreverent collection of essays, Jen Mann, nationally bestselling author of People I Want to Punch in the Throat, turns her mordant wit on the holidays. On Mann's naughty list: mothers who go way overboard with their Elf on the Shelf, overzealous carolers who can't take a hint, and people who write their Christmas cards in the third person (""Joyce is enjoying Bunko. Yeah, Joyce, we know you wrote this letter.""). And on her nice list. well, she's working on that one. Here, no celebration is off-limits. The essays include: You Can Keep Your Cookies, I'm Just Here for the Booze Nice Halloween Costume. Was Skank Sold Out? Why You Won't Be Invited to Our Chinese New Year Party From hosting an ill-fated Chinese New Year party, to receiving horrible gifts from her husband on Mother's Day, to reluctantly telling her son the truth about the Easter Bunny, Mann knows the challenge of navigating the holidays while keeping her sanity intact. And even if she can't get out of attending another Christmas cookie exchange, at least she can try again next year. Advance praise for Spending the Holidays with People I Want to Punch in the Throat ""Jen Mann understands that wanting to be a good person and yearning to punch the deserving in the throat aren't mutually exclusive. At no time is this more evident than during the holidays. Buy this book if you're a fan of not spending the holidays behind bars.""--Jen Lancaster, author of I Regret Nothing Praise for People I Want to Punch in the Throat ""Jen Mann says the things we're all too afraid to say. Her honest and hilarious writing style reminds me of David Sedaris and Tina Fey.""--Robin O'Bryant, author of Ketchup Is a Vegetable ""Comedy gold. Reading her stories is like riding a waterslide: fast, direct and unpredictable.""--New York Daily News ""Will make you cringe and burst out laughing at the same time.""--Karen Alpert, author of I Heart My Little A-Holes""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Málaga es una ciudad poliédrica, es decir, complicada a más no poder, y también lo son los malagueños; por eso, ni siquiera cuenta con un único tipo de malagueño tópico, cuenta con tres. Para el autor, lo más característico de Málaga es que ofrece al mundo «tres gracias» (tres «tipologías», como dicen los sociólogos con deformación profesional) que nadie quiere admitir como propias: el «majarón», el «merdellón» y el «chusmón». La voz «majarón», del árabe mahrum (desgraciado) describe a esos miles de malagueños a los que les falta un tornillo, incluso si esta ausencia no ha sido detectada por la Ciencia, pero que sí ha confirmado la sabiduría popular.  Generaciones de majarones ilustres han forjado la que Aleixandre llamó la Ciudad del Paraíso, convirtiéndola en un rincón cosmopolita en el que lo racional y lo irracional conviven en un asombroso equilibrio. Málaga, capital económica de Andalucía, no habría sido nada sin los «merdellones», cuyo ejemplo más famoso es el nuevo rico malagueño, pródigo en excesos verbales y ornamentales. La tercera figura, el «chusmón», es la más injustamente tratada, abundando como abunda en todos los barrios de Málaga. Nos referimos a esos jóvenes y adolescentes que exhiben su capacidad de sudoración en la Feria de Málaga, mostrando las carnes, y que campean por la ciudad en coches con una discoteca cañera incorporada.  En la segunda parte del libro, el autor aborda los rasgos y símbolos que mejor definen a los malagueños: la Feria de Agosto, la Semana Santa, la Málaga cosmopolita, la «resurrección de Picasso», los roces con Sevilla, la ciudad que da la espalda al mar, la sobreexplotación urbanística. Una oportunidad de conocer, con ironía, las luces y sombras de una ciudad contradictoria que, puesta en la balanza, desprende luz y dinamismo a raudales.

While her wounds are still dangerously close to the surface, her happily married best friend confesses over a bottle of wine that she is this close to having an affair.  And another woman comes to Holly for advice about her love life--with Holly's ex!Holly decides that if everyone around her can take pleasure wherever they find it, so will she.  As any self-respecting 30ish New York woman would do, she brings two males into her life: a flawed but endearing dog, and a good natured, much younger lover.  She's soon entangled in a web of emails, chance meetings, and misguided good intentions and must forge an entirely new path to Nirvana. From the author of The Big Love, Secrets to Happiness is a big-hearted, knife-sharp, and hilariously entertaining story about the perils of love and friendship, sex and betrayal--and a thoroughly modern take on our struggle to be happy.

Oh Zaperetta!,Albert Russo,humor,First published in 2004,/works/OL2558425W,/authors/OL363815A/Albert_Russo,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11721110M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 31, 2004|Publisher  Xlibris Corporation|Language English|Pages 476","Review by David Alexander  Zulu Zapy Wins the Rainbow Nation  Authors who, like Shakespeare, make wisdom come out of the mouths of fools are nothing new.  In addition to fools, juveniles, curmudgeons and ingenues have all been created by authors to speak truths that would otherwise be hard to take or impossible to fathom.  The technique may be as old as literature itself, but the distinction of having done it exceedingly well has been won by only a few. Voltaire, in creating Candide, was among these select few writers. Mark Twain, in Huckleberry Finn was another.  Dickens was a master of the art.     Albert Russo is also a master of this art, and a modern master at that.  His hand is sure and his store of bon mots, exiting with irreppresible verve from his continuing character Zapinette, seems inexhaustible, as does Zapinette's supply of malapropisms attuned to the trend-consciousness of 21st century global society.  Indeed while the word malapropism refers to the Dickensian character Mrs. Malaprop, whose pronouncements were the direct opposite of apropos, I suggest that the new coinage of zapropisms should be used to denote the deliberate misuse of trendy, hip or globalist catchwords of this century, just as Ms. Malaprop made a cleverly ambiguous mockery of those of the 19th by her locutions, for Zapy is a veritable zapropotamus of zapropisms that help make the book a delight to read.  (And I use the word ""delight"" advisedly, reflecting back along the turned tides of decades to the moment in a college class on the Romantic poets with British poet Elizabeth Sewell, who remarked when I stated that the purpose of literature was to entertain that, no, literature's purpose was to ""delight, not entertain.""  Sewell used the word delight in the same sense 19th century critic Matthew Arnold used it.  Steeped in Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley and the like, she'd had a very precise gamut of meaning for the word, as I do, here.)    The novel's plot takes Zappinette, in the company of her usual foil, or straight-man, her Uncle Berky (variously called Unky Berky or Uncle Bonka), to visit family in South Africa, a trip resulting from a contest run by the French government, the fine print of whose terms required the travelers to act as unofficial ambassadors of goodwill on what, according to contest rules, is a ""humanitarian"" journey in which they'll have to complete ""fieldwork"" and report back to the French government.    Here it should be noted that our 12-year-old heroine Zapy is a personifcation of global culture not only by her world wide webbish patter and blogospheric quips, but via a family heritage as diversified as a multinational corporation, with branches in major countries around the world.  The South African part of this multicultural franchise is represented by ""three distant cousins ... whose Huguenot forebears had fled France during the religious wars.""  The first of these kin we encounter is cousin Kif and his ""barrel-like"" wife  Maatje (pronounced, we are helpfully informed Maa-tcha) who live on a ranch near Gravelotte, which is a town outside Pretoria, and which Zapy and Uncle Berky plan to spend a week at before moving on to Durban, their next stop, where yet more family will make them their guests.    Their first stop, though, is Johannesburg, where the second part of the title referring to the Rainbow Nation, makes its presence manifest.  Through the eyes and the voice of Russo's effervescent ingenue's rollicking first person narrative, we're given a grim picture of the realities of South Africa today, that emerge through the thin sugar coating like the awful taste of the inside of an M 'n M when the chocolate's been left sitting in the sun too long and you first bite down through the candy shell.  Rainbows are, after all, illusions, as are the pots of gold at their end, and when the word, or words like it, is used to describe a social milieu it's generally self-mockery.  Just as the socalled Gorgeous Mosaic that Mayor David Dinkens would have liked New York City to have been when he occupied Gracie Mansion was the very opposite of gorgeous and, if a mosaic, a shattered and contentious one, so the rainbow of this Rainbow Nation arches over a land of suffering and disparities which has become more rather than less divided and troubled since the end of Apartheid.    One of Albert Russo's greatest strengths as a writer is the clear-seeing eye he casts on the inequities and injustices of life, including those glaring breaches of the social contract that we all have to put up with but really shouldn't, and here he is also reminiscent of that earlier paragon of big-hearted social conscience, Charles Dickens.  Although the narrative cycle of which Zulu Zapy is a part bears a subtitle which refers to Zapy's ""hilarious adventures around the world"" this, as all other Zapinette novels (hilarious though they may be) are works that don't shrink from the responsibility of all the best literature to fulfill one of an author's chief goals, which is to tell us (or if not tell us, then show us) that seemingly mundane and unremarkable yet so very often implausible and vagrant thing: the truth.

Rosy Edwards is the epitome of a contradictory twenty-something year old. She's frugal when it comes to food shopping, but is willing to splash out on shampoo. She's career minded, she just doesn't know which career to have in mind right now. And although she's happy being single, a part of her kind of wants a boyfriend. So after a few unsuccessful dates with friends of friends (read: being forced to date their shortest/dullest/oddest acquaintance), she put herself on Tinder, the app that has transformed the world of online dating. And she soon learns the unspoken rules the hard way: always reject a guy with black and white profile pics (he is ginger and/or ugly); is wearing a hat (bald); has a shot of his torso (moron) or is not standing beside anything scaleable (5""8 and under). And then there are the dates themselves.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But however much she loves reading the stars, she just can't seem to get her life on track, and this week is no exception. First she's jilted at the altar by Ben. Then, sitting alone and forlorn in her home in Hazy Hassocks, she discovers that the flat above is owned by an ex-convict! Luckily for Phoebe, the upstairs felon turns out to be a bit dishy. In fact, Rocky isn't a real felon at all, just banged up for helping a lady in distress and inadvertently injuring a hoodlum in the process. He might also be just what Phoebe needs to get over Ben. But it's when Rocky introduces Phoebe to his grandmother that the fun really begins to start. Just like Phoebe, Essie is a star-sign demon, and together they decide to add pizzazz to their lives by starting a match-making business with a twist. Which is how the Happy Birthday Personology Club is born, which is when things start to go really wrong.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In 1978 Jimmy Carter mediates the Camp David Accords, Fleetwood Mac tops charts with Rumours, Starsky fights crime with Hutch, and twelve-year-old Lou Cove is uprooted from the Upper West Side of Manhattan to Salem, Massachusetts- a backwater town of witches, Puritans, and sea-captain wannabes. After his eighth move in a dozen years, Lou figures he should just resign himself to a teenage purgatory of tedious paper routes, school bullies, and unrequited lust for every girl he likes. Then one October morning an old friend of Lou's father, free-wheeling (and free-loving) Howie Gordon arrives at the Cove doorstep from California with his beautiful wife Carly. Howie is everything Lou wants to be: handsome as a movie star, built like a god and in possession of an unstoppable confidence. Then, over Thanksgiving dinner, Howie drops a bombshell. Holding up an issue of Playgirl Magazine, he flips to the center and there he is, Mr. November in all his natural glory. Howie has his eye on becoming the next Burt Reynolds, and a wild idea for how to do it: win Playgirl's Man of the Year. And he knows just who should manage his campaign. As Lou and Howie canvas Salem for every vote in town - little old ladies at bridge club, the local town witch, construction workers on break and everyone in between - Lou is forced to juggle the perils of adolescence with the pursuit of Hollywood stardom. Man of the Year is the improbable true story of Lou's thirteenth year, one very unusual campaign, and the unexpected guest who changes everything""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Crowell|Language English|Pages 81,"Tired? Nervous? Rundown? Can't sleep? Don't give it another thought. This is  your book. Let George Morrison, the stage of sleepless hollow, bring sunshine into your  nights with this handy, bedside volume devoted entirely to that noctambulist bugaboo,  insomnia.        No drowsy amateur, Mr. Morrison is the wide-awake veteran of more than twenty  years of sleepless nights. When it comes to insomnia, he knows whereof he speaks and he  speaks in no uncertain terms on the 54 theories - 54 which have one time or another  been guaranteed to set a dynamo drowsing. Warm milk, black coffee, feet warm, feet  cold, head up, head down, single bed, double bed, Chalk on the nose - all the methods  you've ever heard of, and a great many you haven't, for grabbing a little shut-eye are  in this exhausting treatise on insomnia. And who knows, one of them maybe just the  thing for you.        So if you, too, toss and turn; or if, like Mrs. Morrison, the author's  long-suffering helpmate - bedmate, you are married to someone who ""just can't close an  eye"" you'd better grab this warm, witty book before another restless night is wasted.

White whistling, walking down a hospital hallway, stark naked except for his shoes and socks; Arthur Miller accepting an award in memory of a famous critic whose name he can't remember; Lucille Ball auditioning on her knees before David O. Selznick for the part of Scarlett O'Hara; Beverly Sills lamenting her absence at Aunt Hazel's funeral, saying, ""If only you'd given me a few weeks' notice."" ""Pardon Me, But You're Eating My Doily!"" is a hilarious compendium of embarrassing moments in the lives of the world's most celebrated figures.  What made Ronald Reagan turn beet red? (Hint: It wasn't the New Federalism.) To whom did Andre Previn serve his less-than-scrumptious specialty of hamster food and milk? What yacht-side swan dive stripped away Rudolph Nureyev's panache? And where in the world did Steve Allen leave that overripe persimmon? We have all had memorable moments we wish we could forget, and now Robert Morley, famed British actor, writer, and raconteur, has compiled these richly funny, archly amusing anecdotes from personalities such as Jimmy Carter, David Niven, Yehudi Menuhin, Herman Wouk, Mel Brooks, B. F. Skinner, Ann Landers, George Bush, and dozens more. Even those rare ones among us who claim never to have committed a faux pas will find themselves helplessly snickering at ""Pardon Me, But You're Eating My Doily!""

Atlantica, a world of compulsive consumption, fervent Utopianism, emotional discovery, and love on the rocks. Torn from his family, exiled from his native island of Atlantica, and imprisoned on the former Disney ship Sea Hero, one-time computer whiz Harvey Nash has found solace in the voodoo art of papier-mache. But as the execution date of his violent cellmate approaches, he is confronted with daily reminders of the wrongful sentence meted out to him by the consumer-dedicated system he once voted for. Is it too late for vengeance of Libertycare's Facilitator General, and the machine known as the Boss? Was the disappearance of the woman Harvey loved a tragic accident - or something more sinister? And is the notorious Sect really so dangerous that only erasure of civil liberties can contain it? In a witty, satirical vision of the future worthy of Orwell or Huxley, Jensen evokes a world of rampant consumerism, blind obedience, virtual love and home-chewed papier-mache.

Mathematical elegance,"Goldberg, Steven",humor,First published in 2015,/works/OL20001290W,/authors/OL715967A/Goldberg_Steven,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 108,"""The heart of mathematics is its elegance; the way it all fits together. Unfortunately, its beauty often eludes the vast majority of people who are intimidated by fear of the difficulty of numbers. Mathematical Elegance remedies this. Using hundreds of examples, the author presents a view of the mathematical landscape that is both accessible and fascinating. At a time of concern that American youth are bored by math, there is renewed interest in improving math skills. Mathematical Elegance stimulates students, along with those already experienced in the discipline, to explore some of the unexpected pleasures of quantitative thinking. Invoking mathematical proofs famous for their simplicity and brainteasers that are fun and illuminating, the author leaves readers feeling exuberant--as well as convinced that their IQs have been raised by ten points. A host of anecdotes about well-known mathematicians humanize and provide new insights into their lofty subjects. Recalling such classic works as Lewis Carroll's Introduction to Logic and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper by John Allen Paulos, Mathematical Elegance will energize and delight a wide audience, ranging from intellectually curious students to the enthusiastic general reader""--Publisher's description.

She had a chicken ramen); in another piece, Alexander Graham Bell has teething problems with his invention (I've been calling Mabel all day, she doesn't pick up!

This compendium of all-new practical jokes is a wild, diabolical follow-up to the original. Like The Practical Joker's Handbook, this sequel is built upon contributions submitted to his Web site from Nyberg's fans. Of course, the entertaining Nyberg has sifted though his warped fans' merciless suggestions to weed out the dangerous, the mean-spirited, and the potentially litigious. As Nyberg says in the book's introduction, it's only a good practical joke if both parties (eventually) find humor in the prank. The Practical Joker's Handbook: The Sequel is a sly collection of blueprints for jokes and pranks to play at home, at work, at school, at the office--anywhere.

Understanding language through humor,Stanley Dubinsky,humor,First published in 2011,/works/OL16486072W,/authors/OL7072228A/Stanley_Dubinsky,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25186072M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 202,"""Students often struggle to understand linguistic concepts through examples of language data provided in class or in texts. Presented with ambiguous information, students frequently respond that they do not 'get it'. The solution is to find an example of humour that relies on the targeted ambiguity. Once they laugh at the joke, they have tacitly understood the concept, and then it is only a matter of explaining why they found it funny. Utilizing cartoons and jokes illustrating linguistic concepts, this book makes it easy to understand these concepts, while keeping the reader's attention and interest. Organized like a course textbook in linguistics, it covers all the major topics in a typical linguistics survey course, including communication systems, phonetics and phonology, morphemes, words, phrases, sentences, language use, discourses, child language acquisition and language variation, while avoiding technical terminology""--  ""Former Hooters waitress settles toy Yoda suit PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) - A former waitress has settled her lawsuit against Hooters, the restaurant that gave her a toy Yoda doll instead of the Toyota she thought she had won. Jodee Berry, 27, won a beer sales contest last May at the Panama City Beach Hooters. She believed she had won a new Toyota and happily was escorted to the restaurant's parking lot in a blindfold. But when the blindfold was removed, she found she had won a new toy Yoda - the little green character from the Star Wars movies. David Noll, her attorney, said Wednesday that he could not disclose the settlement's details, although he said Berry can now go to a local car dealership and ""pick out whatever type of Toyota she wants.""1 If you appreciate the pun behind the practical joke that led to this lawsuit, then you've understood, at least on some level, the linguistic features upon which it hinges. First of all, the company name Toyota and the two-word phrase toy Yoda both have stress on the second syllable ""yo"". In addition to that, the t sound in Toyota is produced sounding much like a d when it occurs between two vowels (such as o and a). The result is that both sound nearly identical when pronounced in normal, conversational, rapid speech. This is not just a fact about these two expressions.

The Mississippi Writings of Mark Twain (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn / Adventures of Tom Sawyer / Life on the Mississippi),Mark Twain,humor,First published in 1982,/works/OL15290035W?edition=ia%3Amississippiwriti00twai,/authors/OL18319A/Mark_Twain,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3490166M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1982|Publisher  Library of America,              Distributed to the trade by the Viking Press,              Literary Classics of the United States|Language English|Pages 1084","Mark Twain is perhaps the most widely read and enjoyed of all our national writers. This Library of America collection presents his best-known works, together for the first time in one volume.  Tom Sawyer “is simply a hymn,” said its author, “put into prose form to give it a worldly air,” a book where nostalgia is so strong that it dissolves the tensions and perplexities that assert themselves in the later works. Twain began Huckleberry Finn the same year Tom Sawyer was published, but he was unable to complete it for several more. It was during this period of uncertainty that Twain made a pilgrimage to the scenes of his childhood in Hannibal, Missouri, a trip that led eventually to Life on the Mississippi. The river in Twain’s descriptions is a bewitching mixture of beauty and power, seductive calms and treacherous shoals, pleasure and terror, an image of the societies it touches and transports.  Each of these works is filled with comic and melodramatic adventure, with horseplay and poetic evocations of scenery, and with characters who have become central to American mythology—not only Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, but also Roxy, the mulatto slave in Puddn’head Wilson, one of the most telling portraits of a woman in American fiction. With each book there is evidence of a growing bafflement and despair, until with Puddn’head Wilson, high jinks and games, far from disguising the terrible cost of slavery, become instead its macabre evidence.  Through each of four works, too, runs the Mississippi, the river that T. S. Eliot, echoing Twain, was to call the “strong brown god.” For Twain, the river represented the complex and often contradictory possibilities in his own and his nation’s life. The Mississippi marks the place where civilization, moving west with its comforts and proprieties, discovers and contends with the rough realities, violence, chicaneries, and promise of freedom on the frontier. It is the place, too, where the currents Mark Twain learned to navigate as a pilot—an experience recounted in Life on the Mississippi—move inexorably into the Deep South, so that the innocence of joyful play and boyhood along its shores eventually confronts the grim reality of slavery.    -- https://www.loa.org/books/79-mississippi-writings   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But all that changes the morning she meets Max Stoddart, her new colleague at the Daily Vanguard. With his upscale suit, Hugh Grant hair, and obscenely sexy good looks, he's a single woman's dream come true. Finally, her grandmother can stop surfing the Net for eligible Jewish males. But is Max the catch of the decade---or just a major babe magnet? Meanwhile, Rebecca's old high school nemesis has resurfaced, a former blond bombshell called Lipstick who is now engaged to Rebecca's widowed dad. And it's good-bye to articles on toe cleavage when a hot tip sweeps Rebecca to the center of the Paris cosmetics world, where a miracle anti-wrinkle cream is about to be launched. That is, until she blows the whistle on a scandal that could set the beauty business---and the future of world peace---reeling. Will Rebecca win the recognition---not to mention the Pulitzer---she yearns for...and get the man of her dreams?  Stay tuned.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Fierce Pajamas,"David; Finder, Henry Remnick",humor,First published in 2001,/works/OL8965102W,/authors/OL3110378A/David_Finder_Henry_Remnick,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8828925M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Random House|Language English,"When Harold Ross founded The New Yorker in 1925, he described it as a ""comic weekly."" And although it has become much more than that, it has remained true in its irreverent heart to the founder's description, publishing the most illustrious literary humorists of the modern era--among them Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Groucho Marx, George S. Kaufman, James Thurber, S. J. Perelman, Peter De Vries, Mike Nichols, Marshall Brickman, Woody Allen, Donald Barthelme, Calvin Trillin, George W. S. Trow, Veronica Geng, Garrison Keillor, Ian Frazier, Roy Blount, Jr., Bruce McCall, Steve Martin, Christopher Buckley, and Paul Rudnick.This anthology gathers together, for the first time, the funniest work of more than seventy New Yorker contributors. Parodists take on not only writers like Hemingway and Kerouac, but TV documentaries, Italian cinema, and etiquette books. (Enough have been published, Robert Benchley maintains, ""that there should be no danger of toppling over forward into the wrong soup, or getting into arguments as to which elbow belongs on which arm."") Other pieces offer perspectives on the heights of fame, the depths of social embarrassment, and the ups and downs of love and sex. Such well-loved sketches as Thurber's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" take their place alongside light-hearted essays on food, tennis, and taxis, and flights of fancy that follow an apparently simple premise to the point of no return, and sometimes well beyond. Here you will find large insights (Woody Allen: ""Why does man kill? He kills for food. And not only food: frequently there must be a beverage"") and hard-earned wisdom (Ian Frazier on dating your mom: ""Here is a grown, experienced, loving woman--one you do not have to go to a party or a singles bar to meet, one you do not have to go to great lengths to know""). And, not least, a great deal of helpful advice, including Steve Martin's on memory and middle age: ""Bored? Here's a way the over-fifty set can easily kill a good half hour: 1. Place your car keys in your right hand. 2. With your left hand, call a friend and confirm a lunch or dinner date. 3. Hang up the phone. 4. Now look for your car keys.""A rich selection of humorous verse includes caustic gems by Dorothy Parker, the effortless whimsy of Phyllis McGinley, and Ogden Nash's unforgettable slapstick prosody, as well as forays by luminaries who ought to have known better, like Robert Graves, Elizabeth Bishop, and W. H. Auden.A wonderful gift for others, or a delightful treat for oneself, Fierce Pajamas is a treasury of laughter from a publication described by Auden as ""the best comic magazine in existence.""

As a teacher in middle and high school, I have found this book helpful in showing people that ""yes, children and adults really lived without running water.  It was a big thing to have indoor plumbing, especially a toilet.  Yes, toilets had to be invented.""  I used this with the POSTMAN QUESTIONS (asked by Neil Postman) in Teaching as a Subversive Activity.   www.TINYURL.com/50TAASA   to get a free copy of his book.    www.TINYURL.com/PostmanQuestions to get the questions (formatted for classroom use)    To participate in the Postman 50th anniversary, go to www.50yearsofsubversiveteaching.blogspot.com.  These items will put you in the mindset to use this book more creatively.  Certainly do more than ""assign reading"" and ""lecture about each chapter.""   Think about ways that you can use this book while employing tactics and procedures that innovative teachers have developed.   PeterPappas.com has a blogpost that includes more questions that help students learn.  (See his questions at http://tinyurl.com/peterquestions)   For example, one of the Pappas questions is ""    Why do we usually teach all the boring facts first and save the interesting stuff for later?""  This is why THE VERY BLOODY HISTORY was created.   TO PRESENT THE INTERESTING STUFF NOW.  The illustrations are often amusing and can stimulate discussion before anything is read on the page.   I learned how to make an engaging ""poster quote"" when I first saw this book.   It is highly recommended for any history class, since students can be asked, ""Can we make a VERY BLOODY HISTORY of xxxxx?""   (and the xxxx is whatever you are studying.  Why not a bloody history of Biology?    A bloody history of English Literature?    A bloody history of Spanish Grammar and Pronunciation?  Send any suggestions to me at manyposters@gmail.com   THANK YOU for reading this review.  It is difficult to find a PDF version of the book without registering in one of those ""free for 1 month trial"" sites.   Often the result is a recurring charge of $9.99 on the credit card.  OzoneBenefits has the following review of the book: Warning: This book could change your ideas about history for ever!!    Do you know why the Celts got the best girls? Or who had his portrait painted after he was dead? And have you any idea who planned the first Channel Tunnel? From the dawn of civilization to the end of the Second World War, it's all here in the factually accurate and hilariously funny Very Bloody History of Britain.  Bizarre, barmy and almost beyond belief, you've never had a history lesson like it!

A group of migrant workers, who hail from Eastern Europe, China, and Africa have come here to harvest them for delivery to British supermarkets, and end up living in two small trailer homes, a men's trailer and a woman's trailer. They are all seeking a better life (and in their different ways they are also, of course, looking for love) and they've come to England, some legally, some illegally, to find it. They are supervised-some would say exploited-by Farmer Leaping, a red-faced Englishman who treats everyone equally except for the Polish woman named Yola, the boss of the crew, who favors him with her charms in exchange for something a little extra on the side. But the two are discreet, and all is harmonious in this cozy vale-until the evening when Farmer Leaping's wife comes upon him and Yola and does what any woman would do in this situation: She runs him down in her red sports car. By the time the police arrive the migrant workers have piled into one of the trailer homes and hightailed it out of their little arcadia, thus setting off one of the most enchanting, merry, and moving picaresque journeys across the length and breadth of England since Chaucer's pilgrims set off to Canterbury.Along the way, the workers' fantasies about England keep rudely bumping into the ignominious, brutal, and sometimes dangerous realities of life on the margins for ZmigrZs in the new globalized labor market. Some of them meet terrible ends, some give up and go back home, but for those who manage to hang in for the full course of this madcap ride, the rewards-like the strawberries-prove awfully sweet-especially for the young Ukrainians from opposite sides of the tracks, Andriy and Irina, whose initial mutual irritation blossoms into love.

In this bridal gag gift, Laura Willcox writes in the voice of an overbearing, outrageous wedding planner, covering all aspects of a wedding-from the moment of engagement (hopefully with the ring you've been not so subtly emailing him about for months), all the way through the final minutes of the big day.  Accompanied by Jason O'Malley's humorous illustrations, Willcox offers tongue-in-cheek advice for every wedding-planning moment, whether it's dreaming up the perfect wedding-weekend hashtag, planning a gift registry to make everyone jealous of your fabulous lifestyle, or figuring out how to distance yourself from the poor, unfortunate souls who didn't make the cut for your guest list.  Laura Willcox's refreshing take on all things bride will turn tradition on its head, and have you rolling your eyes and reading passages out loud to your engaged (and married) friends.  This funny book is a perfect gift for the friend who can't stop pinning to her dream wedding board, bridezilla-to-be, or any bride who would benefit from a much-needed break from the stress and madness of wedding planning.

Covering topics from pop culture to academia to romance to politics to human mortality to everything in between, this collection of pointed musings aims to amuse, edify, instruct, provoke, tease, caution, and inspire. As with the first installment, the spirit of this book represents a fusion of Montaigne and Wilde; a mashup of Adorno and Yogi Berra; a parallel channeling of Marx and Marx (both Karl and Groucho). No doubt, Hannah Arendt would be appalled at the irreverence on display within these pages. Then again, “Heidegger has left the bildung.” And as the author himself notes: “I have nothing new to say.

When a spinster aunt bequeaths her a house in Portland, Oregon, Lauren intends to fix it up and flip it for a tidy profit. However, her big mouth (which is always a step ahead of her brain) has other ideas. Before she knows it, she's moving in. Lauren discovers plenty of surprises and colorful neighbors to shake things up. From faulty wiring and a sinkhole in the living room to the salty curmudgeon next door, Lauren's new life is heading in unexpected directions. Her friends and family think she's making a grave mistake, but for the first time ever, it might not be Lauren's mouth, but her heart, that will finally come out ahead.""--Page 4 of cover.

And many, as Saints Behaving Badly reveals, were made of very rough materials indeed. The first book to lay bare the less than saintly behavior of thirty-two venerated holy men and women, it presents the scandalous, spicy, and sleazy detours they took on the road to sainthood.In nineteenth- and twentieth-century writings about the lives of the saints, authors tended to go out of their way to sanitize their stories, often glossing over the more embarrassing cases with phrases such as, ""he/she was once a great sinner."" In the early centuries of the Church and throughout the Middle Ages, however, writers took a more candid and spirited approach to portraying the saints. Exploring sources from a wide range of periods and places, Thomas Craughwell discovered a veritable rogues gallery of sinners-turned-saints. There's St. Olga, who unleashed a bloodbath on her husband's assassins; St. Mary of Egypt, who trolled the streets looking for new sexual conquests; and Thomas Becket, who despite his vast riches refused to give his cloak to a man freezing to death in the street. Written with wit and respect (each profile ends with what inspired the saint to give up his or her wicked ways), Saints Behaving Badly will entertain, inform, and even inspire Catholic readers across America.

Raised in the Dorset countryside, Lady Charlotte Wylder doesn’t care one bit about well-bred decorum. The dark-haired, blue-eyed beauty would rather ride a horse than attend a stuffy ball. So when Charlotte learns that she is to leave immediately for London to wed the Duke of Marchbourne, a perfect model of aristocratic propriety, she is less than enchanted with her arranged marriage.  But to her delight, their first encounters are brazenly flirtatious, and their wedding night burns with passion. March’s broad shoulders and dark countenance make Charlotte want to rip every button off his waistcoast. She may even be falling in love with her new husband. Yet whenever their desire boils over, March reluctantly pushes Charlotte away. Will past secrets and present misunderstandings mire their marriage in scandal, or serve to strengthen a bond that is destined to last a lifetime?

And a plumber.Q: This is your first book. Had you ever considered writing anything before? A novel? Or a work of historical scholarship? Or a children's story?KG: I had not considered it, because I'd always been told by the nuns at St. Bernadine's that my cursive was poor. A children' s story is an interesting idea. How's this for a title: ""Waterboarding Pre-Teens: The Debate is Back On."" I have a political side as well.Q: You seem fairly obsessed with Oprah. Is this something you'll ever outgrow?KG: I will never outgrow my obsession with Oprah. Just as she will never outgrow her cardigan sweaters. Oops, she already has. Now look, that sounds like a dig, but it's not. It's called a struggle, and I'm on it with her. I support her. (Not as much as she needs those underwire bras to support her, because she's got some serious ropes and pulleys going on there.) The point is, I worship her, and fear her at the same time. And believe me, that' s how she wants it. Don't be fooled.Q: Did I miss something? Where's Celine Dion in this book?KG: I didn't write about Celine Dion, only because of my fear of her husband Rene Angelil. I have an unfounded but constant fear that he could be in the French-Canadian mafia. Or have French-Canadian mafia ties, and by ties I don't mean les cravats. And I fear that I may be abducted, whisked away and held prisoner at a charming little brasserie in Montreal, forced to eat multiple Croque Monsieur sandwiches until I confess to knowing the lyrics to every single one of her songs.Q: What do you think gays should take away from reading this book?KG: I think the gays should be happy with this book. It talks a lot about being who you are, and I certainly mention a lot of gay people. I would say it definitely has strong gay themes, and the gay community should know that frankly it has been a moral struggle for me to even acknowledge the heterosexual community in this book at all. But I am slowly reaching out an olive branch to the heterosexual community, even though I believe everything they do goes against the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But I'm trying not to judge them.Q: Describe your ideal, make-a-wish day of personal experiences with batst celebrities.KG: Well, it would start with some sort of a fit in the hair-and-makeup trailer on a set. I heard a story that when Sharon Stone was working on ""Casino,"" she got into such a fight with her hairdresser, that after he spent four hours doing this beautiful bouffant hairdo for her, she got up and walked in the sink and put her head underwater. I have no idea if that's true, but I hope it is, cause that's some awesome st I would love to see. Then it would go right to lunch, where I could witness an eating disorder. Maybe a Lohan is purging in a bush somewhere with her finger down her throat. Or perhaps there's an Olsen twin on a scale crying because she finally tipped 100. Any outburst over weight I would cherish. Also, it would be great to see an actress have a workload meltdown. So maybe at 2:00 some A-lister saying, ""I can't handle this st anymore."" Because I love when actors can't deal with a normal workday, and they think two in the afternoon is like midnight, so I would love to see somebody storming to their car, exhausted because they've put in a grueling four-hour workday of saying three lines and texting their nanny. Then it's maybe off to an illicit affair. At the top of my wish list would be following a rapper...   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Lynda Barry, creator of the 'My Life' and 'Ernie Pook's Comeek' comic strips, is syndicated in over 40 alternative weekly newspapers across the country.  The Freddie Stories—featuring sisters Marlys and Maybonne, and their spunky little brother Freddie--continues Lynda Barry's brilliant, raw, and completely original exploration of youth, coming of age, friendship, attitude, and being in the world.  Another Description:  ""The Freddie Stories traces a year in the life of Freddie, the youngest member of the dysfunctional Mullen family. These four-panel entries—each representing an episode in the life of Freddie—bring to life adolescence, pimples and all. With consummate skill, Lynda Barry writes about the cruelty of children at this most vulnerable age when the friends they make and the paths they choose can forever change their lives. Every word of dialogue, every piece of narration, and every dark line evokes adolescent angst. The Freddie Stories is an adult tale about just how hard it is to be a teenager, and it’s classic Barry work—poignant, insightful, and true.""

Demonstrating once again why he is one of Canada's most loved jokesters, Black masterfully captures the laughter that often bursts out of the seams of everyday life. From an unexpected drag race to a Google search for a picture of the illusive ""Arthur the Meek,"" you just never know when a regular day is going to turn into comedic genius. Black provides uproarious insight into uses a matador might have for a teacup, mango or simply some paper towel, the lengths one might go to defend the aural mishearing we've believed in for far too long and the bitter deception felt upon discovering that the hootenanny's bathroom really isn't ""on the right"" after all. But be warned - adding these stories to your day-to-day reading may also double as a daily abdominal workout.""--pub. desc.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For the Buckleys, the days are filled with running, yelling, food, wrestling, and burping—even through family home evening. Every night culminates in an epic bedtime battle.   When the school year ends, however, Mom and Dad decide to harness some of their boys’ apparently inexhaustible energy and buy some goats and chickens for them to take care of. While they are initially thrilled with the “responsibility,” the boys soon learn that it’s far tougher—and far funnier for the reader—than it appears.   If you’ve ever spent any time around boys, this hilarious and occasionally touching story will have you laughing ’til it hurts and fondly remembering some of your own childhood adventures.

Taken together, they give us a nuanced picture of men in hot water--with women, their teenage kids, and their own consciences.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Arranged alphabetically from aardvark to worm, here are one hundred of the most interesting members of the animal kingdom explained, dissected, and illustrated, with the trademark wit and wisdom of John Lloyd and John Mitchinson.Did you know, for instance, that- when a young albatross takes wing, it may stay aloft for ten years- vampire bat saliva--unsurprisingly, when you think about it--is the source of the world's most powerful blood thinning drug, appropriately called draculin- bombardier beetles fire a boiling chemical spray out of their rears at 300 pulses per second- a bald eagle's feathers weigh twice as much as its bones- a giant tortoise recently died at the documented age of 255- octopuses are dexterous enough to unscrew tops from jars- spider silk is so light that a strand long enough to circle the world would weigh as much as a bar of soap?So meet the water bears that can live in suspension for hundreds of years, the parasite carried by your cat that makes men grumpy and women promiscuous, and the woodlouse that drinks through its bottom. Marvel at elephants that walk on tiptoe, pigs that shine in the dark, and woodpeckers that have ears on the ends of their tongues.If you still think a pangolin is a musical instrument, that hyenas are dogs, or that sheep are pointless and stupid, The Book of Animal Ignorance has arrived just in time.From the Hardcover edition.

Not content to pontificate from the sidelines, Rick Reilly set out on a global journey--with stops in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, England, and even a maximum security prison at Angola, Louisiana--to discover the answer to this enduring question.  From the physically and mentally taxing sport of chess boxing to the psychological battlefield that is the rock-paper-scissors championship, to the underground world of illegal jart throwing, to several competitions that involve nudity, Reilly, in his valiant quest, subjected himself to both bodily danger and abject humiliation (or, in the case of ferret legging, both). These fringe sports offer their participants a chance to earn a few bucks and achieve the eternal glory that is winning--even when the victory in question might strike some as pointless, like the ability to sit in an oven-hot sauna for the longest time. It's debatable whether these sports push the body or just human idiocy to the outermost limits, but one thing is for sure: Sports in Hell is laugh-out-loud hilarious and will deliver plenty of unabashed fun.From the Hardcover edition.

When Moxie Brecker chose her kicky nickname back in college, it suited her perfectly. But now she feels it's one big misnomer. After graduation, she set out to command her own seventh-grade science class and was stunned to find the job too challenging. She didn't have the energy necessary to get a roomful of pre-teens excited about atoms, and she never felt like herself, so she handed in her chalk and lesson plans. Stumped about where to turn next, she followed the advice of her best friend, Gerard, and took a job folding underthings at the chain lingerie store in the mall.She's got plenty at home to distract her, including her neighbour, Steven Tyler (no, not that Stephen Tyler) and the kindly septuagenarian Joe, who runs the joke shop downstairs, but she spends her days languishing in the store. Though she feels tired and just out of it physically, she still gets bored steaming peignoir sets, protecting the thong table from shoplifters, and readjusting bras straps for hours on end. Maybe that's why, when a handsome guy named Allan starts hanging around the store for little chats, Moxie sees hope on the horizon. Maybe, just maybe, her employee discount won't go to waste for much longer.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

WHY DID NOBODY TELL ME THIS COULD HAPPEN?!-- This is not the thought you want to be having when you're frantically Googling whether your pregnancy symptom is normal or an emergency. Just when you thought there could never be another pregnancy book, Pregnancy, OMG! comes along, and you realize how much the current market is missing. Did you know that: your nose can change size and shape? Your fingernails, far from growing long and strong, can crack or fall off? You can completely (temporarily) lose your sense of smell? That 5% of women grow a third boob? More seriously, that 25-50% percent of the partners of women with postpartum depression develop it themselves, or that 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage? This is a one-stop guide to every change a woman's body can go through while pregnant, and is unlike anything for expecting parents on the market: it is illustrated by full-color photographs of a diverse set of real pregnant women of all shapes, sizes and ages. Featuring Nancy Redd's trademark warmth, humor, and candor, and partnered with the advice and vetting of medical experts, this book tackles embarrassing, confusing, and less-widely discussed issues that many pregnant women face while offering practical tips and techniques to ease even the strangest problems, helping to dispel panic and shame, and providing women the resources they need for a healthy pregnancy.""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

First, the deli ran out of his favorite cucumber sandwiches. Then he left the gas on at home. But the lowlight was being abducted from his front yard by a particularly ill-mannered alien, one who apparently doesn't believe in anesthetic, no less. Fortunately, Ian is saved by an unlikely ally: the Twiller, whose bravery is somewhat overshadowed by its uncanny resemblance to a floating yellow marshmallow with big eyes.  The Twiller follows the adventures of Ian and his newfound companion as they are whisked around the Universe, and Ian learns how difficult it can be to find his way home to a backwater planet called ""Earth."" Along the way, Ian must survive the traffic of El Leigh, the enthusiastic protestors of Bez Erkeley, and rampaging politicians in the city of WMD. Even worse, he must contend with exorbitant prices in the city of York, endure the heat and crazy drivers in Fleur Ida, and struggle to escape the small planet of ""Huh? Why E?"" before he contracts island fever. Astute readers might pick up on subtle correlations to real places here on Earth, but my lawyers have reminded me to state that such resemblances are purely coincidental.

However, he is unaware that these torments are due to the secret manipulations of New Renaissance, an experimental organization that hopes to improve mindless main-stream culture by raising writers who emphasize artistic quality over commerce. New Renaissance hires ex-musician Harlan Eiffler to manipulate its most promising prodigy, Vincent. Wickedly antisocial and disgusted by what passes for entertainment in the twenty-first century, Harlan ensures that Vincent remains a true artist. He poses as Vincent's manager and nurtures his career, all the while continuing to torture him. Smart, funny, and poignant, Torture the Artist examines the timeless idea that true art can only result from suffering. About the author: Joey Goebel was born and raised in Henderson, Kentucky.

At seventeen, Rosie and Alex are starting to see each other differently, and the move separates them just when their relationship seems as if it will finally turn romantic.

And the father is not Alex.Her dreams for college, Alex, and a glamorous career are dashed against harsh reality, and Rosie stays in Dublin to become a single mother, while Alex pursues a medical career. As the years pass, the two continue to interact, but can’t seem to find each other at the right time.

Covering the years from 1996 through 2010, Ellington presents (50) insightful, articulate, witty, and sometimes amazingly humorous literary examinations that kick, push, and shove their way through the psyche from beginning to end. A storyteller in her own respect, Cat Ellington, regarded by many as being one of the best to ever pen a literary review, doles out one impressive critique after another in honor (or dishonor) of both the fictional and nonfictional dialogue alike. Included in Volume 2 of the standout Reviews by Cat Ellington Complete Anthology book series are the author’s cleverly-written reviews of Another Country by James Baldwin, Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago by Mike Royko, Swan by Naomi Campbell, Fine Beauty by Sam Fine, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, The Judge by Steve Martini, The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed by Sara Gay Forden, The Mist by Stephen King, Along Came a Spider by James Patterson, and many more.

To his three-million-plus listeners, Greeny is the guy who's equally as comfortable dissecting zone defenses as he is discussing cashmere sweaters. He's been to Super Bowls and World Series, All-Star Games and Final Fours. He's interviewed Michael Jordan, Joe Montana, and Wayne Gretzky. He gets paid to enthuse about sports, which means he's the envy of most men in America. This is the hilarious, sometimes touching, and endlessly entertaining debut of one of America's fastest-rising sportscasters, a wry and revealing look at one man's good-hearted but mistake-prone attempt to grow up before his children do. Marriage, fatherhood, manhood, fame, athletes, crazed aunts with gambling problems, the true significance of sports, the worst possible thing to say in a room full of pregnant women--no topic is beyond his reach. But don't take our word on it, read what Greeny has to say about:- Dating: ""People who reminisce fondly about dating are blocking out all the disasters and focusing only on the few great nights. If that is all you choose to remember, fine. But be aware that no experience is without good moments. I'm sure during the sacking of Rome there were a few decent nights; maybe they put on a play."" - Life on the road: ""Wife + television = no sleep.""""No wife + no television = no sleep.""""Wife + no television = sleep.""""No wife + television = porn.""- Keeping things in perspective: ""Never assume you know more than the guy in the camouflage tux.""- And, of course, marriage: ""All of us are married to women who think we're idiots.""Whether he's talking trash on the radio or talking dirty diapers over a fancy dinner, Greeny's determined to reconcile two halves of a whole. So if your enthusiasm has ever been curbed, or you're feeling remote without the remote, or you're just wondering what exactly goes on in a guy's brain, Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot will be a source of comfort and unadulterated laughter.From the Hardcover edition.

For seventy years he tossed out one-liners that sent waves of laughter through audiences all over the country; a Henny Youngman nightclub appearance guaranteed a sold-out engagement. A vaudeville headliner, Youngman also went on to conquer radio and television. In Take My Wife, Please! Youngman's enduring routines are collected in one volume. A rapid-fire comic, he could tell six, seven, sometimes even eight jokes a minute, like: Walked into a store and said, ""This is my wife's birthday. I'd like to buy her a beautiful fountain pen."" The clerk winked at me and said, ""A little surprise, huh?"" I said, ""Yes, she's expecting a Cadillac."" You meet the craziest people on the subway. One guy sitting next to me kept saying, ""Call me a doctor--call me a doctor."" I asked, ""What's the matter, are you sick?"" He said, ""No, I just graduated from medical school."" Youngman began his career with the intention of becoming a concert violinist. When he discovered that he had a talent for making people laugh, the violin became a prop. He was called the King of the One-Liners for good reason, and this collection shows why""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And now, in his hilarious primer How to Really Stink at Golf, Foxworthy shares his invaluable tips for a lifetime of horrible drives and putts.- Get into the right frame of mind to play truly awful golf. Food poisoning or a killer hangover might be just the ticket to a robust three-digit score.- Try to get to the course promptly at tee time to avoid the hassle of warming up: ""You're only gonna hit five good shots in the course of the day; why waste even one on the driving range?""- The surefire way to screw up a great drive? As you walk to the tee, keep telling yourself, ""Don't screw up your drive."" If bad golf's your goal, stress is your best friend.- Avoid fun. ""Fun = relaxed = low scores . . . and that's something we want to avoid at all cost. If you have a good hole, shake it off.""- Perhaps the most important element: Embrace the fact that you do stink at golf. Cheating. Cursing. Avoiding fairways. Reckless cart driving. How to Really Stink at Golf covers it all, from selecting the correct putter to use on a 385-yard drive to prolonging your stay in the sand trap to picking the perfect foursome for spectacularly bad golf (""you, your ex-wife, your girlfriend, your wife""). With Jeff Foxworthy as your guide, even a scratch golfer can add ten, twenty, maybe thirty strokes to his or her score--and possibly more if you attempt to play the back nine, too.From the Hardcover edition.

From the kid at the pet-food store checkout line whose coif is so bizarre it makes her seethe ""I'm going to kick his hair's ass!"" to the hapless Sears customer-service rep on the receiving end of her Campaign of Terror, no one is safe from Laurie's wrath. Her cranky side seems to have eaten the rest of her--inner-thigh Chub Rub and all. And the results are breathtaking. Her riffs on e-mail spam (""With all of these irresistible offers served up to me on a plate, I WANT A PENIS NOW!!""), eBay (""There should be an eBay wading pool, where you can only bid on Precious Moments figurines and Avon products, that you have to make it through before jumping into the deep end""), and the perils of St. Patrick's Day (""When I'm driving, the last thing I need is a herd of inebriates darting in and out of traffic like loaded chickens"") are the stuff of legend.

More than six popular late-night shows air every night of the week, and with recent major shake-ups in the industry, late-night television has never been more relevant to our public consciousness than it is today. Jon Macks, a veteran writer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, takes us behind the scenes of this world for an in-depth, colorful look at what really makes these hosts the arbiters of public opinion. From the opening monologue--what's funny, what's dangerous, what's untouchable--to the best vs. worst guests, Macks covers the landscape of late-night comedy and punctuates the narrative with hysterical personal anecdotes, shining the spotlight on some of the very best late night jokes, and drawing from more than half a million of his own jokes written over the span of twenty years. With an insider's expertise and a laugh-out-loud voice, Macks explains how late-night TV redefines the news and events of any given day, reshapes public opinion, and even creates our national zeitgeist""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet now, not only has Flora been reunited with her family and opened a charming café by the sea, but she and Joel are taking their first faltering steps into romance.

Fresh and fun, The Goddess Rules is an outrageous, wry, and razor-sharp portrait of a girl who thinks her life is just fine--until she meets a woman who swears by the belief that life is meant to be fabulous.When obsessed pet owners have pooches or kitties they want immortalized on canvas, Kate Disney is the artist of choice. From her shed (which doubles as a studio and apartment) in London's Primrose Hill, Kate caters to the whims of the rich and famous while herself living a decidedly bohemian existence. The problem is, she has a tendency to cater to her on-again, way-off-again boyfriend as well. Jake is so erratic, that most of her friends don't understand why she even bothers. But it's hard to fall out of love with a man who writes her songs and calls her ""Angel""--even if he disappears for weeks at a time. Luckily for Kate, Mirabelle Moncur isn't buying any of that claptrap. Mirri was an actress, a legend in her time. Now, at age sixty, she's given up on fame and men and lives in Africa, where she raises lion cubs. But her reclusive nature has done nothing to dull her beauty, mar her incredible figure, or dampen her outrageous joie de vivre.After sweeping into London to have Kate paint a portrait of her favorite cub, Mirri seizes hold of Kate's life--from the baggy wardrobe to the hopeless taste in men. Under Mirri's tutelage, Kate learns to dance on tables with abandon, drink like a dockworker, and flirt like a goddess. And when her old friend Louis reenters the picture, she begins to see things in a whole new light. But Mirri has secrets that hint at a less than divine future. Now it's Kate's turn to teach Mirri a thing or two about life, love, and being fabulous.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Well, perhaps not soul . . . He hastily sold his years ago in order to learn the laws of necromancy.  But now, tormented by a dark secret, he travels to the fiery pits of Hell to retrieve it.  Satan, who is incredibly bored these days, proposes a little wager: Johannes has one year to persuade one hundred people to sign over their souls or he will be damned forever. To make the bet even more interesting, Satan throws in that diabolical engine of deceit, seduction, and corruption known as a ""traveling circus"" to aid in the evil bidding. What better place exists to rob poor sad saps of their souls than the traveling carnivals historically run by hucksters and legendary con men?With little time to lose, Johannes raises a motley crew from the dead and enlists his brother, Horst, a charismatic vampire (an unfortunate side effect of Johannes's early experiments with necromancy), to be the carnival's barker.  On the road through the pastoral English countryside, this team of reprobates wields their black magic with masterful ease, resulting in mayhem at every turn.Johannes may have the moral conscience of anthrax, but are his tricks sinful enough to beat the Devil at his own game? You'll never guess, and that's a promise!Brilliantly written and wickedly funny, Johannes Cabal the Necromancer combines the chills and thrills of old-fashioned gothic tales like The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the mischievous humor of Wicked, and the sophisticated charms of Jonathan Strange &Mr. Norrell and spins the Faustian legend into a fresh, irreverent, and irresistible new adventure.

Whether starting out or starting again, women face the difficult task of sorting through the good (guy), the bad (boy) and the ugly (morning after) in their search for Mr. Right. Here,giving hope to smart single women everywhere is Amy DeZellar, who bravely dedicated two years of her life to debunking common dating myths and documenting 50 of her dates. She's gone wine-tasting with Indentured Cats, a blind date who also happened to be blind; been accosted in a cornfield by Glitter Ball, a lounge musician who grew up with the Beatles; and found her artistic sentiments at odds with her desire for financial security when she simultaneously got involved with a painter named Harry Potter and a NASA super-computer designer named Teflon, all in her quest to chronicle the dating life of a regular girl and maybe even find true love. Each of the 50 chapters is dedicated to a different date, and includes the kinds of tips and sharp observations that only someone on the front lines can offer. Get ready to laugh, cry, and commiserate with Amy--and learn, as she did, a few things about finding the perfect man.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After Dave's humorous attempts to capture the sleep-deprived obliviousness of being a first-time dad went viral, he and Alice Bee found themselves bona fide Internet and television celebrities.

Nick Monday is a private detective with a penchant for coffeehouse baristas and the ability to steal other people's luck. Politicians and celebrities. Lottery winners and game show contestants. Accident survivors and successful athletes. All it takes is a handshake and Nick walks away with their good fortune, which he sells on the black market to the highest bidder. But lately, business has been slow. So when the sexy daughter of San Francisco's mayor offers Nick $100,000 to find her father's stolen luck, Nick thinks this is his big break. But he soon ends up blackmailed by the feds, kidnapped by the Chinese mafia, and accosted by vegans and angry naked women with knives...all while trying to save a ten-year-old kid with the purest luck he's ever seen.  Hailed as ""pitch-perfect"" by The Washington Post and deemed ""one of America's best satiric novelists"" by Kirkus Reviews, Browne's masterful combination of humor and biting social commentary make for an irresistible read""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Plane tickets to visit hardly-missed relatives cost more than the suitcase full of presents people have to lug across the country. And radios everywhere play songs about that fat guy in a red suit on an endless loop. Yes, it’s official: Christmas Sucks. This title is a humorous look at America’s commercialization of the Christmas holiday season and the terrible travel, inordinate amount of preparation, and family strife that accompanies it. You can commiserate with the fact that everyone drives themselves into debt buying gifts, no one enjoys seeing long-lost relatives, and everyone is creeped out by the department store Santa. With twelve days of Christmas, there’s plenty of reasons why this is far from the most wonderful time of the year.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Artfully balancing the cosmic with the cosmopolitan, the Uptight Seattleite (aka Adrian) delights his loyal readers each week with snide insight on everything from fashion (""Can I pull off a Rasta beret?"") to ear-bud etiquette. In A Sensitive Liberal's Guide to Life, he brings his savvy smugness to his widest audience yet, on topics such as the hierarchy of transportation righteousness (what to do with the clunky old Subaru after purchasing a Prius) and ethical behavior at the grocery store, including how to handle the horror forgetting to bring your reusable burlap sack.Other day-to-day advice covers what to read on the bus (Vonnegut versus The Kite Runner versus The Economist) and feasting at the buffet of diversity, with tips for shooting a condescending smile at those who don't know how to use chopsticks. The Uptight Seattleite also helps readers navigate the big issues, such as responsible parenting (which calls for a mini-landfill kit, perfect for the backyard and ready to be stuffed with environmentally unfriendly diapers). For every insecure liberal-and those who love to make fun of them-the Uptight Seattleite offers us laughs from the pinnacle of political correctness.

There are insights into his life as he takes readers back to his Eighties school disco days to reveal how the greatest moment of his teenage years was ruined by Queen's Radio Ga-Ga. He also shares the wisdom of his life experience from his time on CBeebies' Doodle Do with a lesson on the dangers of toilet roll. And he answers many of life's great questions ... Why isn't optimism enough to complete a marathon? Why does food taste better in a field? And, more importantly, what is the point of Petit Filous? These thoughts and more are all here, delivered in his unique affectionate and charming way. Quick Reads are exciting, short, fast-paced books by leading, bestselling authors, specifically written for emergent readers and adult learners.""--Publisher's description.

Here, in her first collection in eight years, are eleven new stories bristling with her signature wit and weight. One way or the other, all of these stories are about women looking love in the face without flinching.  Some of them are confronting the reality of domestic disruption; others are simply flirting with the possibilities—and dangers—of change. McCorkle's characters make mistakes but aren't interested in hiding behind them. They get divorced or quit their jobs or tell people to step aside, and they move on.From the first story, about a modern-day Cinderella contemplating escape, to the last, ""Me and Big Foot,"" an idyll about finding the perfect prince, McCorkle's collection is the genuine article, the work of a great storyteller who knows exactly how—and why—to pair longing and laughter.

Please take care of her. But beware. This is a dangerous baby. At Lily's annual Christmas costume party, a variety of strange events take place that lead Jo and Lily out of California forever--and into the mysterious, strange, fantastical world of Eldritch City. There, Jo learns the scandalous truth about who she is, and she and Lily join the Order of Odd-Fish, a collection of knights who research useless information. Glamorous cockroach butlers, pointless quests, obsolete weapons, and bizarre festivals fill their days, but two villains are controlling their fate. Jo is inching closer and closer to the day when her destiny is fulfilled, and no one in Eldritch City will ever be the same.From the Hardcover edition.

Six months. Only the strong survive.Joy Silverman and her boyfriend, Gabriel Winslow, seem perfect for each other. Living together in New York City, they have everything they want and everything in common--most important, that neither one wants to get married. Ever.But when Joy finds herself obligated to attend seventeen weddings in six months (including those of her father, mother, younger brother, and five of her closest girlfriends), the couple is forced to take a new look at why they're so opposed to marriage when the rest of the world can't wait to walk down the aisle. As the season heats up and the pressure mounts, Joy must confront what it means -- and what it costs -- to be true to one's self.A witty, wicked comedy of manners in the satirical tradition of Jane Austen and Evelyn Waugh, Wedding Season is an intelligent, laugh-out-loud funny examination of friendship, faith, integrity, and the ideas and institutions that bind us together, shape our lives, and define who we are.""If Jane Austen and Candace Bushnell were to meet for a long drink in a downtown bar, the delightful result might be a contemporary comedy of manners with a decidedly old-fashioned feel. Darcy Cosper has given us just that: a sweet and sharply funny concoction that will have bridesmaids everywhere nodding their heads in recognition."" -- Dani Shapiro, author of Family History""Wonderful....Wedding Season is social comedy on a grand scale.

The aspiring jazz soloist and single mother has no singing prospects, no man in her life since her hot fling with a movie stuntman, and a social life that consists of having her two best friends over for high-calorie Sunday brunches. Even her grandmother's having more sex than she is. That is, until toddler Jake's irresistible father hurtles back into her life.Albert promises fidelity, plus married life filled with the best sex Stephanie's ever had. But there's a tantalizing new wrinkle: Frank Waterman, rising star and Stephanie's old crush, is suddenly semi-available and interested. And her stalled career seems to be heating up. But when her big break erupts in a scandal that puts her on the front page instead, Stephanie's in a whole new league. Now, with fame at her door and two hot guys fighting over her, Stephanie's got some big decisions to make...and they may surprise everyone--including her.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Many of the stories are modern takes on classic monsters crafted with twisted plots. The Wolfman of 'Wolfman and Janice' is doing the best he can under very trying circumstances, especially when confronted with eating his elderly neighbor's cat. Theres an adolescent vampire-wannabe who is suffering badly: in love for the first time. 'Frankenstein and His Mother' is a terrifying story of a grown man who wears a Frankenstein mask, lives with his mother, and watches TV and eats corn chips all day, too afraid to work.  'Draculas Daughter' turns a pretentious hippie into an honest ghost. And Bigfoot -- lonely, sexually frustrated -- tells all. Other stories feature characters who seem perfectly normal until they're alone. Phil, for instance, is never so happy as when hes with his inflatable girlfriend, Vanessa -- until she tells him the devastating truth about himself. Elderly Ellen is running out of patience with her dead husband George, whos turned prankish. 'Bob and Todd' tells the story of a hitchhiking ride gone bad that will have readers squirming in their seats.

Shelley Stone might be a little overwhelmed. She runs the company Conch, the manufacturer of a small wearable device that attaches to the user's ear and whispers helpful advice and prompts. She's married with two small children, Nova and Blazer, both of whom are learning Mandarin. She employs a cook, a nanny, a driver, and an assistant, she sets an alarm for 2AM conference calls, and occasionally takes a standing nap while waiting in line when she's really exhausted. Shelley takes Dramamine so she can work in the car; allows herself ten almonds when hungry; swallows Ativan to stave off the panic attacks; and makes notes in her day planner to ""practice being happy and relatable."" But when Shelley meets a young woman named Shelley Stone who has the exact same scar on her shoulder, Shelley has to wonder: Is some sort of corporate espionage afoot? Has she discovered a hole in the space-time continuum? Or is she finally buckling under all the pressure? Introducing one of the most memorable and singular characters in recent fiction, The Glitch is a completely original, brainy, laugh-out-loud story of work, marriage, and motherhood for our times""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

But Chris's life is about to change. The eighties are coming to an end and he must take decisive action if he is to fulfil what he suspects is his true potential. So, after pre-emptively celebrating the fact he is about to hand in his resignation, Chris goes to bed drunk in 1988 but very unexpectedly wakes up in 2006, with an unbelievable hangover, a long-suffering (and worryingly 'old'-looking) stranger for a wife, a life that hasn't turned out the way he had hoped for at all, and an unnerving amount of new body hair...""--BOOK COVER.

Elite Eli University junior Amy Haskel never expected to be tapped into Rose & Grave, the country's most powerful--and notorious--secret society.  She isn't rich, politically connected, or...well, male. So when Amy receives the distinctive black-lined invitation with the Rose & Grave seal, she's blown away. Could they really mean her? Whisked off into an initiation rite that's a blend of Harry Potter and Alfred Hitchcock, Amy awakens the next day to a new reality and a whole new set of ""friends""--from the gorgeous son of a conservative governor to an Afrocentric lesbian activist whose society name is Thorndike. And that's when Amy starts to discover the truth about getting what you wish for. Because Rose & Grave is quickly taking her away from her familiar world of classes and keggers, fueling a feud, and undermining a very promising friendship with benefits. And that's before Amy finds out that her first duty as a member of Rose & Grave is to take on a conspiracy of money and power that could, quite possibly, ruin her whole life.A smart, sexy introduction to the life and times of a young woman in way over her head, Secret Society Girl is a charming and witty debut from a writer who knows her turf--and isn't afraid to tell all....From the Hardcover edition.

Long time leaving: dispatches from up South,Roy Blount Jr.,humor,First published in 2007,/works/OL14852825W?edition=ia%3Alongtimeleavingd00blou,/authors/OL2629877A/Roy_Blount_Jr.,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17580527M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Knopf|Language English,"""I left the South in search of the Enlightenment. I'm pro-choice, in favor of gay marriage, and against creationism and the war in Iraq. But both my parents' people are deep Southern from many generations, and I spent a little over a third of my life, including the presumably most formative years (toilet training through college), living in the South. Mathematically, that makes me just about exactly as Southern as the American people, 34 percent of whom are Southern residents. But it goes deeper than math--my roots are Southern, I sound Southern, I love a lot of Southern stuff, and when my [Northern] local paper announces a festival to 'celebrate the spirit of differently abled dogs,' I react as a Southerner. I believe I care as much about dogs' feelings as anybody. It is hard for me to imagine that a dog with three legs minds being called a three-legged dog.""A sly, dry, hilarious collection of essays--his first in more than ten years--from the writer who, according to The New York Times Book Review, is ""in serious contention for the title of America's most cherished humorist.""This time Blount focuses on his own dueling loyalties across the great American divide, North vs. South. Scholarly, raunchy, biting and affable, ol' Roy takes on topics ranging from chicken fingers to yellow-dog Democrats to Elvis's toes. And he shares experiences: chatting with Ray Charles, rounding up rattlesnakes, watching George and Tammy record, meeting an Okefenokee alligator (also named George, or Georgette), imagining Faulkner's tennis game, and being swept up, sort of, in the filming of Nashville. His yarns, analyses, and flights of fancy transcend all standard shades of Red, Blue, and in between.Roy on language: ""Remember when there was lots of agitated discussion of Ebonics, pro and con? I kept waiting for someone to say that if you acquire white English, you can become Clarence Thomas, whereas if you acquire black English, you can become Quentin Tarantino.""Roy on eating: ""The way folks were meant to eat is the way my family ate when I was growing up in Georgia. We ate till we got tired. Then we went ""Whoo!"" and leaned back and wholeheartedly expressed how much we regretted that we couldn't summon up the strength, right then, to eat some more.""Roy on racism: ""Anybody who claims . . . not to have 'a racist bone' in his or her body is, at best, preracist and has a longer way to go than the rest of us.""Blount's previous books have included reflections on a Southern president (Jimmy Carter), a novel about a Southern president (Clementine Fox), a biography of Robert E. Lee, a celebration of New Orleans, a memoir of growing up in Georgia, and the definitive anthology of Southern humor. Long Time Leaving is the capper. Maybe it won't end the Civil War at last, but it does clarify, or aptly complicate, divisive delusions on both sides of the longstanding national rift. It's a comic ode to American variety and also a droll assault on complacency North and South--a glorious union of diverse pieces reshaped and expanded into an American classic, from one of the most definitive and esteemed humorists of our time.From the Hardcover edition.

Now, in I Shudder, he trains his wickedly perceptive eye on everything from his New Jersey family to Hollywood to demented alcoholic Broadway stars waving swords. At his Uncle Rudy's funeral, Rudnick's beloved Aunt Lil put one hand on her husband's coffin and her other hand on Rudnick's shoulder and said, ""Your Uncle Rudy always loved you. He never understood why, in your writing, you had to use that kind of language, but he loved you."" Charming and touching, I Shudder is rendered in Rudnick's gorgeous, zinger-laden prose and reminds us of the need to keep our tongues sharp in the midst of life's many obstacles and absurdities. Here is one of the most accomplished collections in years, from a writer who ranks with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs as one of our most gifted and hilarious social observers.

And this is a love story? Yup. 'Cept there's no whining. See, while some lovers were born to run, Jody and Tommy were born to bite. Well, reborn, that is, now that they're vampires. Good thing theirs is an undying love, since their Goth Girl Friday, Abby Normal, imprisoned them in a bronze statue.Abby wants to be a bloodsucking fiend, too, but right now she's really busy with other stuff, like breaking in a pair of red vinyl thigh-high Skankenstein® platform boots and wrangling her Ph.D.-candidate boyfriend, Steve (the love monkey). And then there's that vampire cat Chet, who's getting bigger and smarter—and thirstier—by the minute. Abby thought she and Steve could handle the kitty cat on their own, mais non . . .Before you can say ""OMG! WTF?"" Tommy and Jody are sprung from captivity, and join forces with Abby, Steve, the frozen-turkey-bowling Safeway crew, the Emperor of San Francisco and his trusty dogs Lazarus and Bummer, Abby's gay Goth friend Jared, and SF's finest Cavuto and Rivera to hunt big cat and save the city. And that's when the fun really begins.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|1 Currently reading|6 Have read

At a price even an intern can afford and in a handy paperback format that won't weigh down your messenger bag or briefcase, The Dictionary of Corporate Bullshit is a hilarious guide to the smoke-screen terms and passive-aggressive phrases we traffic in every day. Each entry begins with a straight definition followed by a series of alternative meanings that are, of course, what is really meant.Take, for example, the widely used, seemingly innocuous term brainstorming:1.  to generate ideas as a group in an accepting environment and in a free-form manner2.  a supposedly relaxed forum in which no idea is a bad idea -- that is, until you generate a bad idea and are met with uncomfortable silence/looks that suggest you are retarded or really uncool/the feeling that you are about to be firedBeyond deciphering corporate commonplaces, you'll learn the PC term for secret Santa (Holiday Harry); why the Blackberry is ""most commonly referred to as a 'Crackberry' due to its highly addictive nature""; and that when a co-worker says ""Have a good night"", they really mean: ""this meaningless, seemingly interminable exchange of small talk is now over. I am no longer speaking to you, and will now flee this awkward social situation. Don't even think of asking which way I'm walking.""Just remember to read this only at COB (close of business) to avoid being busted (caught idling by your boss).From the Trade Paperback edition.

The popular friendship of Phoebe and Her Unicorn is back for a third collection of adventures so heavenly they had to be shared.  School's out! That means no more teachers, no more books, and lots of time to compliment Marigold Heavenly Nostrils on her good looks. In this third volume, Phoebe and her obligational best friend, Marigold, learn that summer still has plenty of surprises for the both of them. All of our old friends are back--Phoebe's part-time ""frenemy"" Dakota, upon whom Marigold has bestowed sentient hair, Phoebe's goofy parents, and even Lord Splendid Humility (but please, ignore his magnificence if you can)! Have fun as Phoebe and Marigold continue the ""Phoebegold Detective Agency,"" spend a week at Wolfgang Music Camp, and find themselves in more misadventures, thanks to Marigold's enchanted sparkles! Along the way, Phoebe makes some new friends, such as Sue--her unique clarinet-playing bunkmate, Florence Unfortunate Nostrils, Marigold's estranged sister, and Camp Wolfgang's lake monster who enjoys tacos and Wi-Fi. When school resumes, read along as Phoebe enjoys (or suffers from) a brief case of popularity, mentally catalogs her grievances against dodge ball, and, with Marigold's help, rescues Dakota and her hair from the queen of the goblins. Through these wacky adventures, Phoebe and Marigold learn that their friendship is the second most magical thing of all, after Marigold's beauty, of course.

For America's bicentennial, Reader's Digest named Franklin ""Man of the Year"" for embodying the characteristics we admire most about ourselves as Americans--humor, irony, energy, and fresh insight.  Recreating Franklin's words in the way that his contemporaries would have read and understood them, Paul M. Zall chronicles Franklin's use and abuse of humor for commercial, diplomatic, and political purposes. Dedicated to Fanklin's uniquely appealing and enduring humor, Zall lovingly samples Franklin's apologues on the necessity of living reasonably even when life's circumstances may seem absurd. - Publisher.

And the luxury space yacht Cole just hijacked turns out of be filled with interstellar do-gooders, one especially loathsome stowaway, and a cargo of freeze-dried orphans.Reluctantly compelled to deliver these defenseless, fluidless children to safety, Cole gathers a misfit crew for a desperate journey to the far reaches of the galaxy.

I had to hold a tight rein on truth, for fear it would not be believed. And even then I seem to have strained the credulity of some readers.”Charles Fox Gardiner, Colorado Springs Gazette, January 25, 1939Doctor at Timberline is a collection of Gardiner’s first-hand experiences as a physician in the new state of Colorado. He changed the names of the towns and the people in these true stories in a gentlemanly effort to conceal their identities. Many years have passed since Caxton Printers first published this book in 1938—and so, we are confident that revealing the true locations Gardiner describes will not arouse any offense. Crested Butte (Silver Cup), in Gunnison County, was the young coal-mining town where he first opened his medical practice in 1883. He married Emma “Daisy” Palmer Monteith in November 1884 and they set up housekeeping in Meeker (Cowtown), in Rio Blanco County. By 1887, the Gardiner family relocated to Colorado Springs, where he became internationally known for his theories on the treatment of tuberculosis.

The surprising ways that the lives of these apartment dwellers intersect, building to an emotional climax in the final piece. In ""Jacob's Bath,"" an older couple's intimate marital ritual is betrayed by the press. An enigmatic young man binds up his dates in the title piece; and a man mysteriously comes into the possession of a pair of opal earrings in ""The Opals.""

One afternoon in Atlanta, Georgia. Two people heading to the altar. One hundred fifty guests. The bride, Elizabeth Gottlieb, proud graduate of the University of Virginia and of Emory University School of Law, member of Atlanta's wealthy Jewish elite. The groom, Hank Jackson, not a member. Not a Jew. The couple of the hour, however, is beside the point, because We Are Gathered belongs to the guests. Among them, Carla, Elizabeth's quick-witted, ugly duckling childhood best friend turned Hollywood film scout, whose jaundiced view of the drama that is an American wedding provides a lens of humor and its corollary, deep compassion for the supporting actors who steal the show; Elizabeth's great-aunt Rachel, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who is still navigating a no-man's-land between cultures and identities decades after escaping from the forests of Europe; Elizabeth's wheelchair-bound grandfather Albert, who considers his legacy as a man, both in the boardroom and the bedroom; and Annette, the mother of the bride herself, reminded now of her youthful indiscretions in love and motherhood.

Yet countless fascinating characters are relegated to a historical limbo. In A Treasury of Foolishly Forgotten Americans, Michael Farquhar has scoured the annals and rescued thirty of the most intriguing, unusual, and yes, memorable Americans from obscurity. From the mother of Mother's Day to Paul Revere's rival rider, the Mayflower murderer to ""America's Sherlock Holmes,"" these figures are more than historical runners-up—they're the spies, explorers, patriots, and martyrs without whom history as we know it would be very different indeed.

Have You No Shame?,Rachel Shukert,humor,First published in 2008,/works/OL9466741W?edition=ia%3Ahaveyounoshameot0000shuk,/authors/OL3485843A/Rachel_Shukert,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL10686293M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 29, 2008|Publisher  Villard,              Villard Books|Language English|Pages 272","Growing up in white-bread Omaha, Nebraska, Rachel Shukert was one of thirty-seven students (circa 1990) in Nebraska's only Jewish elementary school. She spent her days dreaming of a fantasy Aryan boyfriend named Chris McPresbyterian, a tall blond god whose family spoke softly in public and did not inquire after his bowel movements. She spent her nights frantically plastering her bedroom with pictures of intimidating co-religionists such as Henry Kissinger and Bette Midler, hoping to repel the Gestapo officers she was certain were lurking behind the drywall. Even back then, Rachel knew she was destined for greatness. After winning the Omaha Metropolitan Area Theater Arts Guild Award for Best Youth Actress--and imagining herself as the biggest talent to come out of Nebraska since Montgomery Clift--Rachel finally arrives in Manhattan. Intent on making her mark in the glittering world of Show Biz, she isthwarted at every turn by episodes of anorexia, verbally abusive sock puppets, and a certain terrorist attack you may have heard of. She nevertheless soldiers on, as her people have done from time immemorial. In this hilarious, mordant, and moving memoir, Rachel Shukert tackles topics as diverse and weighty as life, death, love, Jewish paranoia, and errant feminine hygiene products with a fresh and irresistible mixture of humor, brains, and candor, proving that having no shame can sometimes be a very good thing indeed.Praise for Have You No Shame""Shukert's sharp comic turns careen smack into the middle of our hearts...As in Lorrie Moore's stories, we feel a deep compassion through our laughter...As the title suggests, Shukert bears all on this journey. She may regret some of her antics, but we don't regret riding shotgun.""                                                                                                  -- Los Angeles Times""In her debut book of autobiographical essays...Rachel Shukert deftly pins down the essence of being young, brash, and sexually awkward in the mid 90's...recognizable and hilariously unpredictable...Shukert has a talent for pulling out the gritty, uncomfortable details that bring her stories into sharp relief...and packs enough force and honesty to send you reeling.""                                                                                                                                       -- Time Out New York""At times bawdy, at times bleak, Rachel Shukert's laugh-out-loud-funny and gloriously written coming-of-age portrait will remind you of other precocious youngsters with morbid streaks--think of Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums and Salinger's Glass family contemplating their annihilation over brisket.""--Joshua Neuman, publisher of Heeb ""This book is so friggin' funny! It's twisted, surprising, and extremely hilarious, no joke. Shukert is a damn good writer, and there are even helpful footnotes for us gentiles!

And when he shows up on a Harley-Davidson Road King and asks her to hop on, she’s convinced he’s lost his mind. Meanwhile, her invaluable housekeeper, Lillian, has been evicted from her home by her greedy landlord. Deciding that Lillian’s need is greater than her own fear (not to mention loss of dignity), Miss Julia takes Sam up on his offer and sets off on a motorcycle Poker Run to raise some fast cash. She’s ready to risk life and limb in Sam’s sidecar to save Lillian’s home from the bulldozer, but will Miss Julia’s scheme work?   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

People are obsessed with Ryan O'Connell's blogs. With tens of thousands reading his pieces on Thought Catalog and Vice, watching his videos on YouTube, and hanging on to each and every #dark tweet, Ryan has established himself as a unique young voice who's not afraid to dole out some real talk. He's that candid, snarky friend you consult when you fear you're spending too much time falling down virtual k-holes stalking your ex on Facebook or when you've made the all-too-common mistake of befriending a psycho while wasted at last night's party and need to find a way to get rid of them the next morning. But Ryan didn't always have the answers to these modern day dilemmas. Growing up gay and disabled with cerebral palsy, he constantly felt like he was one step behind everybody else. Then the rude curveball known as your twenties happened and things got even more confusing. Ryan spent years as a Millennial cliche: he had dead-end internships; dabbled in unemployment; worked in his pajamas as a blogger; communicated mostly via text; looked for love online; spent hundreds on ""necessary"" items, like candles, while claiming to have no money; and even descended into aimless pill-popping. But through extensive trial and error, Ryan eventually figured out how to take his life from bleak to chic and began limping towards adulthood. Sharp and entertaining, I'm Special will educate twentysomethings (or other adolescents-at-heart) on what NOT to do if they ever want to become happy fully functioning grown ups with a 401k and a dog""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Along with listservs, pornography, and listservs dedicated to pornography, there was a website that ran all its articles in the same font and within abnormally narrow margins.

Now, fifteen years later, most of those readers have died, but the Tendency still exists, publishing, every day, quasi-humor writing in the same font within the same abnormally narrow margins. The site has no ads, and no revenue prospects, and thus, every year or so, we collect some of the site’s better material and attempt to trick readers into paying for a curated, glued-together version of what is available online for free.

After all, life is about perspective, right? So, when you can't seem to escape Murphy's law, take solace with a few passages from humorist Jason Kaplan's Things that Suck. From getting dumped and having no one to kiss on New Year's Eve, to the nightly news, frivolous lawsuits, Jar Jar Binks, and, yes, even mosquitoes, Things that Suck flows with all the unpleasantries that rank high and low on the Kaplan scale of suckage. Lauded by New York Magazine as surprisingly perceptive, Things that Suck calls attention to examples of suckitude such as: The morning commute Your driver's license photo Overly perky people People who think they're great at British accents The kid kicking the back of your seat That kid's parentsThink of this book as company for your misery, or as an intriguing way to understand the complicated world we've created and the complex variety with which it screws us over each and every day. Whether you've experienced schadenfreude (deriving pleasure from another's misfortune), or you've simply had a no-good, very bad, terrible day, take comfort with Kaplan's compendium, Things that Suck, and realize things aren't so dreadful after all.

Part hilarious farce, part biting gender commentary, Amram blends Cosmo and science to highlight absurdities with a machine-gun of laugh-inducing lines that leave nothing and no one unscathed.

K. Narayan (1906-2001), the forefather of modern Indian fiction, human-scale hopes and epiphanies express the promise of a nation as it awakens to its place in the world. The three novels brought together in this volume, all written after India's independence, are masterpieces of social comedy, rich in local color and abounding in affectionate humor and generosity of spirit.Mr. Sampath--The Printer of Malgudi is the story of a businessman who adapts to the collapse of his weekly newspaper by shifting to screenplays, only to have the glamour of it all go to his head. In The Financial Expert, a man of many hopes but few resources spends his time under a banyan tree dispensing financial advice to those willing to pay for his knowledge. In Waiting for the Mahatma, a young drifter meets the most beautiful girl he has ever seen--an adherent of Mahatma Gandhi--and commits himself to Gandhi's Quit India campaign, a decision that will test the integrity of his ideals against the strength of his passions.As charming as they are compassionate, these novels provide an indelible portrait of India in the twentieth century.From the Hardcover edition.

That is, until she meets Mercury, an anti-establishment angel who's frittering his time away whipping up batches of Rice Krispy Treats and perfecting his ping-pong backhand instead of doing his job: helping to orchestrate Armageddon. With the end near and angels and demons debating the finer political points of the Apocalypse, Christine and Mercury accidentally foil an attempt to assassinate one Karl Grissom, a thirty-seven-year-old film school dropout about to make his big break as the Antichrist. Now, to save the world, she must negotiate the byzantine bureaucracies of Heaven and Hell and convince the apathetic Mercury to take a stand, all the while putting up with the obnoxious mouth-breathing Antichrist""--Cover.

From billionaire business tycoons like George Soros and Warren Buffett to movie industry moguls like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Stephen Spielberg, American liberals are using government breaks and shortcuts to pervert the free market. These ""rich bastards"" leverage crony connections to bag millions for phony ""green companies"" that go bust, vacuum public coffers to build glitzy stadiums, utilize little-known tax loopholes to loot $1.5 billion for Hollywood movies, and more. They use government to rig the game in their favor and leave taxpayers holding the bill. And when government gets in the business of picking winners and losers through bailouts and tax breaks, free market competition begins to atrophy. That's what big government leftists--and corporate Republicans-in-name-only--want to happen. In this explosive, funny-as-hell investigative expose;, Mattera reveals the infuriating schemes that result when the filthy rich combine cronyism and capitalism. Crapitalism pulls back the curtain on a cast of cronyites who make millions taking advantage of taxpayers--and still brag about how they're looking out for the little guy""--  ""New York Times bestselling author and ambush journalist Jason Mattera sets his sights on his next big target: crony liberals, including Al Gore, Carlos Slim, Harry Reid, and Jay Z, whose riches come at taxpayer expense""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Then he dives into the chapters on shooting, where he covers the role that composition plays in urban exploration photography; the three major shooting styles or uban exploration photography; general guidelines for camera settings and gear; why you should bracket your shots; and how to approach shooting in the dark (including light painting, using flashes and gels, and using an intervalometer).

As the host of Radio Free Vermont--""underground, underpowered, and underfoot""--seventy-two-year-old Vern Barclay is currently broadcasting from an ""undisclosed and double-secret location."" With the help of a young computer prodigy named Perry Alterson, Vern uses his radio show to advocate for a simple yet radical idea: an independent Vermont, one where the state secedes from the United States and operates under a free local economy. But for now, he and his radio show must remain untraceable, because in addition to being a lifelong Vermonter and concerned citizen, Vern Barclay is also a fugitive from the law. In Radio Free Vermont, Bill McKibben entertains and expands upon an idea that's become more popular than ever--seceding from the United States. Along with Vern and Perry, McKibben imagines an eccentric group of activists who carry out their own version of guerilla warfare, which includes dismissing local middle school children early in honor of 'Ethan Allen Day' and hijacking a Coors Light truck and replacing the stock with local brew. Witty, biting, and terrifyingly timely, Radio Free Vermont is Bill McKibben's fictional response to the burgeoning resistance movement""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this collection of autobiographical essays, Winstead vividly recounts how she fought to find her own voice, both as a comedian and as a woman, and how humor became her most powerful weapon in confronting life's challenges. Growing up in the Midwest, the youngest child of conservative Catholic parents, Winstead learned early in her life that the straightforward questions she posed to various authority figures around her-her parents, her parish priest, even an anti-abortion counselor -prompted many startled looks and uncomfortable silences, but few answers. Her questions rattled people because they exposed the inconsistencies and hypocrisies in the people and institutions she confronted. Yet she didn't let that stop her from pursuing her dreams. Funny and biting, honest and poignant, this no-holds-barred collection gives an in-depth look into the life of one of today's most influential comic voices. In writing about her childhood longing to be a priest, her role in developing The Daily Show, and of her often problematic habit of diving into everything head first, asking questions later (resulting in multiple rescue-dog adoptions and travel disasters), Lizz Winstead has tapped an outrageous and heartfelt vein of the all-too-human comedy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But he reckoned without the great British public. Not only was the book a smash hit, it also opened the floodgates to a deluge of emails and letters stuffed full of further mistranslations and mutilated phrases. From a leaflet from the Museum of Rasputin in Russia (which is apparently situated in a house that belonged a pilot fish Zubov) to a song title on a pirated Pink Floyd CD (Come Fartably Numb), the scrambled sentences just kept flooding in. At the same time Charlie has continued his travels and picked up gems of his own. With such a wealth of material, a sequel wasn't just a necessity, it was a public service, and Still Lost in Translation is even more addictive, whimsical and side-splittingly hilarious than the first book.

What I Think Happened, the debut book by comedian Evany Rosen, is really two books: a savvy, no-holds-barred romp through the history of the western world, and the personal story of a self-described 'failed academic' who recasts historiography from a feminist perspective--albeit an underqualified and overconfident one. In these wide-ranging comic essays, Evany explores numerous historical events and personalities that have had a personal impact on her as she attempts to understand why they've been the object of such fascination, from her unnatural obsession with Napoleon, to her misguided understanding of the Royal Family, to her intrigue over America's dumpiest presidents. Evany's approach to history is to make it personal, which any good historian will tell you is exactly what not to do; but in doing so, and with whimsy and irreverence, she rescues history from the dusty confines of 'intellectually aggressive' men and makes it fun again""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

You're not just imagining it: People are getting more and more rude - from cutting in line, gabbing on their phones and clipping their nails on public transportation, to hurling epithets on Twitter and in real life (including a certain President who does both). And the worst part is that it's contagious, leading reasonably courteous people to stoop to new lows in order to respond to the ever-coarsening encounters we face every day. In this engaging and illuminating new book, bestselling author and all-around curious guy Danny Wallace looks at the reasons behind the rudeness, and what we can do to stop it. His quest to stop the madness includes interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, NASA scientists, politicians, and other experts. He joins a Radical Honesty group, talks to LA drivers about road rage, and confronts his own online troll in a pub--all to better understand the scourge that's turning normal people into bullies, tantruming toddlers, trolls, and other types of everyday monsters. Want to be part of the solution? Let Danny Wallace be your smart and funny guide.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

A nameless man boards a plane in Los Angeles, headed for London. A ballplayer. Or at least until recently. Injuries have compelled the worst team in professional basketball to cut him from the squad. But another team will surely pick him up. Only a matter of time. In the meantime, he reckons, he will put some welcome distance between himself and the country that is trying to take from him his livelihood.The tale starts out innocently enough with the man making a nuisance of himself with everyone he encounters across the pond.  He tells of his troubles, the people who have wronged him, the bad breaks he's had....while all the while he woos women, yells for more ale, eats his way out of shape, spews opinions, and drives his rental car as if he's starring in a speed-crazed cartoon.Yet we soon discover what is really driving him and that he is a man heading for a meltdown.Courtesy of this reluctant and clueless expatriate in a rented sportscar, we are allowed a glimpse of the verdant fields of Sussex, the whiff of a crowded West End pub, the hopeful wails of the railbirds lining the stretch at Glorious Goodwood Racecourse, and the multiple sensory delights that make up a ten-o'clock sunset over a swath of water they call the Little Minch, in northern Scotland.Even for those not paying close attention, quite a journey.

Gerd War Selten Dabei,Martin Lutze,humor,First published in 2021,/works/OL25485230W,/authors/OL9630863A/Martin_Lutze,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL34182903M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Independently Published|Language German|Pages 59,"Gerd Löpper war selten dabei. Er blieb genauso unfassbar wie seine extraordinären Botschaften. Zumindest für den Normalbürger. Das war für Gerds 68er Freunde Grund genug ihn zur Kultfigur zu machen, die der Öffentlichkeit unbedingt nähergebracht werden musste. Anlässlich der Taufe ihres bergischen Messias in einer Solinger Kneipe statteten sie ihn mit tiefer Liebe zur Wupper und einem gewissen poetischen Talent aus. Auf den Kampagnen, die Löpper und seine ungewöhnlichen Einsichten bekannt machen sollten, erscheint er nicht, obwohl das Publikum ihn gerne gesehen hätte. Umso öfter ist der Autor dabei. Er beschreibt das Geschehen mit spürbarem Vergnügen und heiterer Ironie. Von Beginn an lässt er den Leser auch an seiner persönlichen Geschichte mit ihren kleinen Höhen und Tiefen teilhaben. Gerd ist zwar selten oder eigentlich nie dabei, aber irgendwie dann doch wieder.    Lange Zeit nach den Ereignissen rund um Löpper kommt es zu einem Déjà-vu, bei dem der imaginäre Freund wieder eine Rolle spielt. Das gerdische Finale zwischen Dichtung und Wahrheit nimmt seinen erstaunlichen Lauf.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

He knows he must do something in this life, but he doesn't know what. His grandmother, the only mother he's ever known, is stuck in a nursing home somewhere. He hasn't seen her in years. Inanimate objects, exterminator icons, street signs are all talking to him, telling him he's got problems. He's messed up, sure, but he's gonna do something about it. He's gonna get deep and go right to it. Self-styled ""poem writer"" of the L.A. vernacular, lover of all that exists, hopelessly unrepentant—because he doesn't even know what that means—Johnny Future tells us about his world, his Hollywood, his Los Angeles, his struggle, and our future... Broken hope and tattered heroism sits beneath his nihilistic generation, transforming it into a heartening, hypersexual, punch-drunk tour de force ushering the drug narrative into the new American century.

How much of what animals know is instinctive, and how much must they learn?In Becoming a Tiger, bestselling author Susan McCarthy addresses these intriguing matters, presenting fascinating and funny examples of animal behaviour in the laboratory and in the wild. McCarthy shows us how baby animals transform themselves from clueless kittens, clumsy cubs, or scrawny chicks into efficient predators, successful foragers, or deft nestbuilders. From geese to mice, dolphins to orangutans, bats to (of course) tigers, McCarthy's warm, amusing, and insightful examinations of animal life and developments provides a surprising window into the mental worlds of our fine fuzzy, furred, finned, and feathered friends.oReaders will be fascinated by a close look at animal intelligence, learning, and family life.

For your own good: hidden cruelty in child-rearing and the roots of violence,Alice Miller,infancy,First published in 1983,/works/OL11649843W?edition=ia%3Aforyourowngo00mill,/authors/OL224269A/Alice_Miller,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL18305179M-M.jpg,"Publisher  Farrar, Straus, Giroux|Pages 284","Miller proposed here that German traumatic childrearing produced heroin addict Christiane F., serial killer of children Jürgen Bartsch and dictator Adolf Hitler. Children learn to accept their parents' often abusive behaviour against themselves as being ""for their own good."" In the case of Hitler, it led to displacement against the Jews and other minority groups. For Miller, the traditional pedagogic process was manipulative, resulting in grown-up adults deferring excessively to authorities, even to tyrannical leaders or dictators, like Hitler. Miller even argued for abandoning the term ""pedagogy"" in favor of the word ""support,"" something akin to what psychohistorians call the helping mode of parenting.  In the Poisonous Pedagogy section of the book, Miller does a thorough survey of 19th century child-rearing literature in the book, citing texts which recommend practices such as exposing children to dead bodies in order to teach them about the sexual functions of human anatomy (45–46), resisting the temptation to comfort screaming infants (41–43), and beating children who haven't committed any specific offense as a kind of conditioning would help them to understand their own evil and fallen nature.  The key element that Miller elucidated in this book was the understanding of why the German nation, the ""good Germans,"" were compliant with Hitler's abusive regime, which Miller asserted was a direct result of how the society in general treated its children. She raised fundamental questions about current, worldwide child-rearing practices and issued a stern warning.   Read more Read less",19 Want to read|1 Currently reading|4 Have read

Originating in second-century, Greek-inspired Christianity, it was quickly translated into other languages, including Latin and Syriac, and enjoyed widespread popularity in the Middle Ages, when it was included as part of the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew. Aasgaard presents the history of research history and analyses its story, transmission, narrative world and values, theology, views of gender and childhood, social setting, and audience -- much of what has not been previously treated. He sees the Infancy Gospel of Thomas as reflecting oral storytelling, situates the story within rural Christianity among the common people, and argues that it can even be considered the first Christian children's story. The volume includes the Greek text of the gospel with an English translation as well as extensive appendices, among them surveys of its historical evidence, variants in the stories, and other ancient infancy gospels.""--P.
