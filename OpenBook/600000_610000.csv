Each procedure and scene is described as told to this small boy, from    the doctor’s office visit to the many in home situations as the family struggles to keep    their daughter alive through her first five years. Eventually a kidney transplant succeeds    in restoring her to a normal child’s life, able to play and eat like her big brother.  Amazingly, this book is based on actual life events. That real transplant story ending is    told on the final page, brought to life with photos of Caitlin, Freddie, both her family and    the donor’s family, along with their son, Mark, the accident victim and eventual donor.    As Caitlin prays on the final page: “God, remember to thank the people who gave me a    kidney and helped me feel better. And thank you for the best birthday I ever had.” Who    could say it better?    From a review of Now Caitlin Can, by Jim Gleason, a heart recipient who read the book with his granddaughter, Carol.

He later turned to politics and became an even greater success as the main spokesman for conservative Republicans and then as president. After serving two terms as governor of California, he was elected president in 1980 and re-elected in 1984. Reagan brought a sense of optimism and good nature to his conservative cause. He worked to reduce the size of the federal government and passed major tax cuts. At the same time, he increased spending on the military, pledging to continue the fight against Soviet Communism. His determined actions contributed to the overthrow of Communist governments and the dissolution of the Soviet Union soon after he left office. In 1988, Reagan's vice president, George Bush, was elected president to carry on his policies. Includes color illustrations, a timeline, boxed features on events and people of special interest, and lively text introducing the featured president and the times in which he lived.
