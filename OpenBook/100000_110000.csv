Na tradição inglesa têm nove vidas e nas lendas árabes apenas seis. Nós humanos, só temos uma vida e não nos podemos dar ao luxo de a desperdiçar. Portanto nada melhor do que seguir os exemplos dos animais que têm mais “vidas” e aprender com eles.  O Tufa aprende a ter prudência, respeitar os animais, comer o que a natureza nos manda, não confiar em estranhos (mesmo que tenham boa aparência) e respeitar a diferença.  Nas suas aventuras é acompanhado pelo Aníbal, o pardal, seu fiel amigo que pede ajuda sempre que o vê em apuros. A ajuda surge quase sempre na figura do veterinário que é simultaneamente a voz da consciência e que ajuda o nosso herói a compreender as lições que deve retirar de cada aventura.

He was hit by a car when he was a little more than a year old and wound up with two functioning back legs- and that's it. One front leg was amputated, the other had a severed nerve and never functioned again. U. W. taught himself to propel himself around by ""rowing"" as put by his owner but could stand on his hind legs for minutes at a time and even jumped along kangaroo-style if hunting or chasing a trespasser out of his yard. He loved eating the rabbits he caught (cooked by his owners) and in later life developed a taste for fine wines, whisky and brandy (given only drops of course) If you love cats this is a great book, very touching, very funny and just a nice little book.

If only it were that simple! But the fact is that your cat is very sensible indeed--about cat things. She knows how to scratch upright surfaces, cough up hairballs, send messages with her pee, and party all night. To the feline mind, these are the stuff of everyday life--as important as sleeping all day and grooming for several hours using nothing but your tongue.    Your clever kitty knows you very well (after all, she sits and stares at you when you're in the bathroom). But how well do you know her? Find out why cats knead against us, the best way to hold a cat, how cats can jump onto your kitchen counters without even a running start, why they chew on your sweaters.    Award-winning pet experts Dr. Marty Becker and Gina Spadafori explain the ins and outs of the feline psyche. Because the better you understand cats, the easier it is to love the kitty on your couch. Can you teach an old cat new tricks? You bet! Expecting a baby? It's perfectly okay to keep your cat. What about kittens? You'll find everything you always wanted to know about feline sex but were afraid to ask.    Your cat's not crazy, but she can be mysterious. Did you know cats can tell time? They talk with their tails and walk on their toes. And there are even rumors that some cats are descendents of space aliens. It's no wonder the ancient Egyptians were not the only ones who worshipped them.    You'll also find the answers to questions that tend to tickle your curiosity: Why do cats' eyes glow in the dark? What's in catnip that makes kitties so silly? Can curiosity really kill a cat?    You've got questions? This book's got answers. Do cats always land on their feet? Find out!

Caramba is a fat, furry, striped cat with a big problem. Every single cat in the world can fly, he sighs, except me! Caramba would love to swoop and glide between the clouds, to feel the wind whistling through his fur.  He tries to soar into the sky over and over again but always lands flat on his face, until finally he sadly accepts that he is earthbound. Don't be such a scaredy-cat, cry his cousins. All cats are meant to fly! They grab his paws and whisk him up into the sky for an impromptu flying lesson that ends with a big splash and a surprising discovery.

Behind an empty house lies a swimming pool, its bottom covered with mud. There is also blood, the smell of human death, and drag marks. But there is no victim. Without a body, it's a crime that will be hard to prove.With stubborn feline curiosity, Joe Grey sets out to investigate. As he, Dulcie, and Kit follow the killer's trail among four houses whose owners are on vacation, they discover that more murder has been planned for the small, close-knit neighborhood. They uncover evidence of conflict among the residents and multiple signs of breaking-and-entering, although nothing valuable seems to be missing.With the help of two local ferals, the cats find the victim's hidden grave and learn of the violence that is yet to come. As they set out to alert the law, they discover the perfect way to thwart the killer-through that person's unnatural but powerful fear of cats.Thus unfolds the next installment in Shirley Rousseau Murphy's beguiling series about the gray tomcat P.I., his feline friends, and human companions, as, skirting danger, they unravel events shaped by human frailty and by the darkest feline imaginings from the killer's past.

But while the media circus around Clyde continues, Jillian learns the real story behind his owner's death-he was murdered.

A decrepit old man with a masterpiece tattooed on his back. A voracious adventuress, a gentle cuckold, and a garden sculpture that becomes an instrument of sadistic vengeance. Social climbers who climb a bit too quickly. Philanderers whose deceptions are a trifle too ornate. Impeccable servants whose bland masks slip for one vertiginous instant.  In these deliciously nasty stories an internationally acclaimed practitioner of the short narrative works his own brand of black magic: tantalizing, amusing, and sometimes terrifying readers into a new sense of what lurks beneath the ordinary. Included in Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected are such notorious gems of the bizarre as ""The Sound Machine,"" ""Lamb to Slaughter,"" ""Neck,"" and ""The Landlady.""

It is witty, observant, educative, entertaining and has the endearing charm of being one of those books you can open at any page or chapter and dive right in or skim. If there is any negative criticism I might lay at its pages, it would be a lack of cross-indexing. But this being the 21st Century, I'm sure there is an electronic version with a word search. A tiny quote from the chapter entitled ""When is a Leader not a Leader"" illustrates perfectly why I love this book and why it has been my rock when I have been in a hard place:- ... the normal corporation interview [is] to me as 'about as scientific as a couple of dogs sniffing each other's arses'.

For one thing, she's reconnected with her ex -- though her cat, Prozac, isn't happy about it. And Jaine's also got a new ghostwriting gig, working on a steamy novel called Fifty Shades of Turquoise . . .  Daisy Kincaid is in her sixties and heiress to a fortune. Now she wants to make a name for herself as a romance author . . . with a little help from Jaine, that is. As Jaine labors away on love scenes, she gets to know the wealthy woman's gentleman friend, her household staff, and her social circle -- every one of whom is horrified when Daisy falls under the spell of a much younger stud named Tommy, a rude, crude lothario who's made himself a fixture in Daisy's Bel Air mansion.  After Tommy and Daisy shock everyone by announcing their engagement, it doesn't take long for someone to stab him in the neck -- with the solid gold Swiss Army knife that Daisy gave him as a gift. The challenging part is trying to narrow down the list of suspects. Jaine's going to have to put a bookmark in that love story and focus all her creative talent into untangling a tale of money and murder . . .

Quinn's Inheritance,Judi Lind,cats,First published in 1991,/works/OL9481684W,/authors/OL3497483A/Judi_Lind,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date April 1, 1991|Publisher  Kismet","WHERE THERE'S A WILL...  It all started with a ginger-colored feline named McLeish. When Quinn Rosetti found the lost, injured kit-ten, she didn't think twice about rushing it to the veterinarian. Quinn returned McLeish to his owner, the Elderly Mrs. Elvira Featherstone, and there was no mention of a reward. But months later, when the eccentric woman passed away, Quinn was called into her lawyer's office for a reading of the will.  Quinn couldn't believe her ears when she heard the terms of the will. Mrs. Featherstone had concocted a crafty plan that relied on Quinn's sense of fairness and responsibility. If Quinn followed the plan, she would inherit enough money to care for her ailing father. But the thought of spending the next two months with Mrs. Featherstone's great-nephew, Gabriel Hunter, was ludicrous!  It didn't help that tall, dark, sexy Gabe had inherited his great-aunt's outrageous sense of humor. Before Quinn knew what had hit her, the fiery redhead was spinning with thoughts of Gabe Hunter. She was supposed to be sharing custody of McLeish with Gabe. Instead, she found herself sharing her thoughts, her deepest secrets, and kisses sweeter than spring blossoms. Gabe Hunter captivated Quinn as he moved into her life--and her cabin. Quin couldn't resist him... though she was sure this was not what old Mrs. Featherstone had in mind!

No entanto, terá de usar perseverança para convencer os seus futuros donos disso mesmo, pois a última coisa de que precisam é de um gato. Mas quando começam a surgir complicações nas suas vidas, todos se apercebem o quão importante Alfie se tornou. Ele trouxe-lhes esperança nos momentos mais negros e mostrou-lhes que a solidariedade é um valor inestimável. Rachel Wells cria com mestria um personagem-gato, que observa com perplexidade os humanos, levando-nos a refletir sobre os nossos comportamentos.""--Cataloger's translation of cover.  ""For all fans of A Street Cat Named Bob, this is the only book to find in your stocking this Christmas. Can a pet really change your life? Alfie is homeless, abandoned after his elderly owner passes away. But when he stumbles on to Edgar Road, Alfie knows he's found his new home. However, the street's residents don't agree - the last thing they need is another stray cat, and he is shooed away from many doorsteps. But as life throws its worst at the residents of Edgar Road, they soon realise how much they all need Alfie - a cat who brings hope to the darkest times, and who will always be a friend to those in need. Heart-warming and uplifting, Alfie the Doorstep Cat is the perfect read for fans of 'A Street Cat Named Bob' and 'Solomon's Tale'.""--Cover.

After one particularly poignant experience, he felt he had no choice but to intercede. So began the saga of Andrew's dramatic relationship with this group of skittish, wild, and sometimes fierce felines. He began to name, nurse, feed, house, rescue, and neuter them. He rose from his bed in the middle of countless nights to fend off their attackers and maxed out credit cards paying vet bills and emergency room hospital visits when he was mauled by the very cats he was trying to help. Call of the Cats is a heartwarming tale of one man's journey from self-absorption to selflessness that is sure to appeal not only to cat lovers but to pet owners the world over. It is also an exploration of the world we live in but rarely see, how our lives overlap with the lives of other creatures, and how such things as names and sibling relationships cross species and continents. Andrew learned that spiritual lessons surround us, no matter where we are and what we do, if we simply stop and learn. He also discovered the joy and satisfaction in helping even one living being to a better life and the solace that comes from another living being, no matter what the circumstances.

Too bad his body didn't!  Advertising copywriter Leigh Koslow doesn't pack heat--just a few extra pounds. And she doesn't go looking for trouble. When she moved into her cousin Cara's refurbished Victorian house, she wasn't planning on discovering a corpse--certainly not one that had been embalmed ten years before. But as anyone in the small Pittsburgh borough of Avalon could tell her, her cousin's house has a history attached. A history dating back to two mysterious deaths in the summer of 1949.  Someone wants Leigh and Cara out of the house--someone who has something to hide. But that someone doesn't know Leigh's impetuous cousin, and when Cara digs her heels in, Leigh looks to her old college chum, local policewoman Maura Polanski, for help. But the answers the trio find only point to more questions. Were the scandalous deaths of fifty years ago really an accident and a suicide? Or were they murder?  The nearer the women get to the truth, the more desperate someone becomes. Because some secrets are better off kept. Especially when they hit close to home!

Cats are more popular than ever today, but where does that fascination come from? What role did cats play in earlier societies? Recent research shows that about 10,000 years ago, cats chose to commit themselves to humans. Egyptian culture is the first to depict cats on a large scale. But cats are also discussed in other religions: the prophet Mohammed is said to have had a special bond with his cat, and in the Middle Ages there was a 'cat monastery' in Cyprus, where monks took care of cats. From the twelfth century, cats in Europe were increasingly associated with the devil and witchcraft. The devil sometimes appeared in the form of a cat, and sometimes witches transformed themselves into cats to play 'mischief'. That bad reputation would carry the cat for centuries to come. The special link between women and cats, the often bawdy double meanings in works of art and the dual meaning of the word '(playing) cat' are also extensively discussed. Recent scientific insights enter into a dialogue with historical and contemporary art and photography in a playful, visual way. Nine chapters and over 200 photographs and reproductions from numerous international collections provide a look at the cat as a pet, god, devil, wife, muse and friend over time and across cultures. Exhibition: Yper Museum, Ypres, Belgium (01.05.2021-30.01.2022)  Dit rijk geïllustreerde boek zet de unieke relatie tussen mens en kat in de kijker. Katten zijn vandaag populairder dan ooit, maar waar komt die fascinatie vandaan? Welke rol speelden poezen in vroegere samenlevingen? Uit recent onderzoek blijkt dat de kat er zo'n 10.000 jaar geleden zelf voor heeft gekozen om zich aan de mens te binden. De Egyptische cultuur is de eerste die op grote schaal katten afbeeldt. Maar ook in andere religies komen katten aan bod: de profeet Mohammed had naar verluidt een speciale band met zijn kat en op Cyprus was er in de middeleeuwen een 'kattenklooster', waar monniken voor katten zorgden. Vanaf de twaalfde eeuw werden katten in Europa steeds meer geassocieerd met de duivel en hekserij. De duivel verscheen soms in de vorm van een kat en soms transformeerden heksen zelf in katten om 'kattenkwaad' uit te halen. Die slechte reputatie zou de kat nog eeuwenlang meedragen. Ook de bijzondere link tussen vrouwen en katten, de vaak schunnige dubbele bodems in kunstwerken en de tweeledige betekenis van het woord '(stoei)poes' worden uitgebreid belicht. Op een speelse, visuele manier gaan recente wetenschappelijke inzichten in dialoog met historische en hedendaagse kunst en fotografie. Negen hoofdstukken en meer dan 200 foto's en reproducties uit tal van internationale collecties bieden een blik op de kat als huisdier, god, duivel, vrouw, muze en vriend in de loop der tijden en in verschillende culturen.

Bridie is struggling to recover from a toothache of the heart "" ... always a Bridie, never a Bride ..."" when she loses her job. At a time when many of her friends are thinking about retiring Bridie finds herself trying to convince Walmart that they need a Playwright-in-Residence. Then her beloved Uncle Beeswax passes away and instead of finding money in the walls of his old homestead she finds she's carted away a pack of ghosts, both figurative and literal. One of her cats needs expensive allergy shots from the vet "" ... the cat creeps in on little fog feet the little frigger, cats are the original false advertising ..."" and the normally docile neighborhood is suddenly very popular with the local hookers. A series of mysterious and disruptive e-mails begin to turn up and Bridie begins to wonder about her state of mind. This intricate story weaves by turns comedic, heart-warming and sometimes heart-breaking voices, telling the intriguing saga of one life gone askew and asks if being askew isn't perhaps all right in the end. It examines the foibles and failures of memory and memories, throws comedic caution to the winds and makes the case that playing on-line Scrabble every morning helps to save the world. With ""This is the Cat"" Berni Stapleton embraces an intimate, humorous and provocative style evocative of the work that won her accolades for ""They Let Down Baskets."" Creative Book Publishing released this award-winning book in 1998. It combined the photographs of Jamie Lewis, a CD of a radio documentary from Chris Brookes, and the revealing journals of Berni. This intricate story weaves by turns comedic, heart-warming and sometimes heart-breaking voices, telling the intriguing saga of one life gone askew and asks if being askew isn't perhaps all right in the end.

Her job in London no longer motivates her. Her relationship with Joaquin has cooled. In Spain, the economic crisis jeopardizes her family. And the worst is yet to come. It is then, that Sibila comes into her life (through the window, actually), an elegant and mysterious Abyssinian cat who seems to know more about Sara's life than she does. With its incisive look, its unique sense of catlike humor and the wisdom of a species that has been observing humans for millennia, Sibila offers to help Sara to face her challenges and reclaim her dreams. There's only one problem: Sara suspects that Sibila may be nothing more than another test of her fledgling mental stability. Or is that some cats have learned to speak? There are many paths to happiness, but cats know all the shortcuts.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The common thread: a cat-loving serial killer who preys on feline owners, whisks away the startled pet, and leaves at the scene a mouse toy as his ""calling card."" This is enough to put Alice hot on the trail for more clues - from the secretive small towns of the Adirondacks, to the pages of a book of nursery rhymes, to the eerie caverns of Central Park, where she finds herself face to face with a mysterious cult whose devotees dabble in cat-worshop - and murder.

But what about the animals who abandoned their wild existence in exchange for our care and protection? Domestication has proven to be a wildly successful survival strategy. But this success has not been without its drawbacks. A modern dairy cow's daily energy output equals that of a Tour de France rider. Feral cats overpopulate urban areas. And our methods of breeding horses and dogs have resulted in debilitating and sometimes lethal genetic diseases. But these problems and more can be addressed, if we have the will and the compassion. Human values and choices determine an animal's lot in life even before he or she is born. Just as a sculptor's hands shape clay, so human values shape our animal's for good and or ill. The little-examined, yet omnipresent act of breeding lies at the core of Gavin Ehringer's eye-opening book. You'll meet cows cloned from steaks, a Quarter horse stallion valued at $7.5 million, Chinese dogs that glow in the dark, and visit a Denver cat show featuring naked cats and other cuddly mutants. Is this what the animals bargained for all those millennia ago, when they first joined us by the fire?""--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Feline images have permeated civilization since the time of the ancient Egyptians, and during this time the status of the cat has changed dramatically. The book examines the changing images-- fertility goddess, sly little predator, agent of Satan, avenging witness, aristocrat, friend, spirit of the home, bloodthirsty killer, seductive female--and relates them to the contexts in which they arose. It also analyzes how human attitudes towards cats seem to have evolved in parallel with attitudes towards animals, towards authority, and towards gender. Western literature and visual art have reflected this change, developing from bare sketches to richly varied expressions of feline personality and human interaction with cats. Katharine M. Rogers seeks out the cats who make appearances in an impressive range of literary and artistic works, providing the first critical look at the symbolic functioning of cat characters in Poe's ""The Black Cat,"" Dickens's Bleak House, and Zola's Therese Raquin, among other literary works. The historical and artistic range covered is impressive, creating a rich compendium that is the ideal book for the cat lover seeking a refreshingly substantial and scholarly work about this fascinating animal. - Publisher.

So when animal behaviorist expert Pru Marlowe gets a call about a kitten, she doesn't expect to find the cuddly creature playing beside the cooling body of prominent Beauville lawyer David Canaday. Heart attack? His three adult daughters angrily blame drug interactions, feline allergies--and each other. And begin to feud over their father, his considerable estate, and that cute ball of fluff. While the cause of death is pending, each sister has an axe to grind--with arguments that escalate when David's partner reads out the will. Pru's special sensitivity to animals, which caused her to flee the cacophony of Manhattan for the quiet Berkshires, adds further problems. The local vet is overwhelmed as the animal hospital's money runs out. There's a needy Sheltie and some invasive squirrels, too. But the dead man's kitten, his former partner, and his troublesome family keep drawing ""wild-girl"" animal psychic Pru back in. Despite the wry observations of her trusty tabby Wallis, now the wrongfully accused kitten's guardian, and the grudging compliance of her cop lover, this may be one time when Pru can't solve the mystery or save the kitten she wants to believe is innocent. A single witness knows the truth about that bright spring morning. How far can Pru investigate without risking her own hidden tale?"" -- provided by publisher.

Instead of singing carols and climbing into Christmas trees, Joe Grey, feline P.I., is faced with his most difficult case yet—and that's saying a lot for a wily tomcat who for years has been solving crimes the police can't even crack. At midnight in the deserted gardens of the shopping plaza, a stranger lies dead beneath the village Christmas tree; the only witness to the shooting is a little child. But when the police arrive, summoned by an anonymous phone call of feline origin, both the body and the child have disappeared. As police scramble for leads, the grey tomcat, his tabby lady, and their tortoiseshell pal, Kit, launch their own unique investigation.Together Joe Grey, Dulcie, and Kit face their most heartbreaking case yet as they care for the child who may be the killer's next target. Trying to sort out perplexing clues amidst the happiness of the season, they shadow a cast of colorful characters. But neither the police nor their unknown feline assistants are aware that they might have stumbled over the murderer and never known it, until an electrifying final scene when the killer's identity is revealed.For years Shirley Rousseau Murphy has written tales that have delighted readers and critics alike. With her lyrical prose and fast-paced plotting, Murphy has created another delightfully absorbing trip to a magical place populated by unforgettable characters whom readers have come to think of as friends.

There they’ll visit dear friends Joan Hamilton and Larry Hodge and enjoy a week among some of the finest horses, trainers, and riders in the country.  But soon after they arrive, events veer mysteriously–and murderously–off course. First, Joan’s ruby and sapphire horsehead heirloom pin is stolen from her private box at the fairgrounds. Next, a young film star’s prize three-gaited mare disappears into thin air. There is no lack of suspects, from hotheaded trainers and jealous rivals to vicious ex-spouses. Then a body is found flagrantly murdered and it’s obvious to Harry that someone at Shelbyville is sending a strong message: winning is only secondary–first prize is survival.  As Harry searches for clues, rediscovers life as a married woman, and deals with her upcoming fortieth birthday, her four-legged detective friends are already on the case. But is animal instinct any match for human depravity? Especially with two humans to protect and a killer on the prowl?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The application of these fundamental equations to the design of environmental-control systems and methodologies for assessing the impact of contaminant discharges into rivers, lakes, wetlands, ground water, and oceans are all covered. Readers learn to assess how much waste can be safely assimilatedinto a water body by developing a solid understanding of the relationship between the type of pollutant discharged, the characteristics of the receiving water, and physical, chemical, and biological impacts. In cases of surface runoff from urban and agricultural watersheds, quantitative relationships between the quality of surface runoff and the characteristics of contaminant sources located within the watersheds are presented.    Some of the text's distinguishing features include its emphasis on the engineering design of systems that control the fate and transport of contaminants in the water environment, the design of remediation systems, and regulatory constraints. Particular attention is given to use-attainability analyses and the estimation of total maximum daily loads, both of which are essential components of water-quality control in natural systems. Readers are provided with a thorough explanation of the complex set of laws and regulations governing water-quality control in the United States.    Proven as an effective textbook in several offerings of the author's class ""Water Quality Control in Natural Systems,"" the flow of the text is carefully structured to facilitate learning. Moreover, a number of practical pedagogical tools are offered:   Practical examples used throughout the text illustrate the effects of controlling the quality, quantity, timing, and distribution of contaminant discharges into the environment   End-of-chapter problems, and an accompanying solutions manual, help readers assess their grasp of each topic as they progress through the text   Several appendices with useful reference material are provided, including current U.S. Water Quality Standards   Detailed bibliography guides readers to additional resources to explore particular topics in greater depth    With its emphasis on contaminant fate and transport and design of environmental-control systems, this text is ideal for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students in environmental and civil engineering programs.Environmental scientists and practicing environmental/civil engineers will also find the text relevant and useful.

Every scientist and engineer encounters problems that may be solved at least in part using the principles of thermodynamics. The importance of thermodynamics is often so fundamental to life that we should all have a fairly detailed understanding of this core field. This clearly written, easy-to-follow guide allows even nonscientists considering use of alternative fuel sources to achieve a solid grounding in thermodynamics. The authors cover topics spanning from energy sources to the environment to climate change. A broad audience of general readers, students, industry professionals, and academic researchers will appreciate the answers found in this book""--  ""Acutely aware that this is especially the case for thermodynamics and thermophysics. The subjects of thermodynamics and thermophysics play a role to some extent in every other discipline of science from the nano-scale to the cosmos and astrophysics with biology and life-sciences on the way. Furthermore, while some aspects of thermodynamics under pin the very fundamentals of these subjects, others parts of thermodynamics impact upon almost every application in engineering. In consequence the range of individuals who may have questions about thermodynamics and its applications encompass most of the world's scientists and engineers at most of the levels of activity from the undergraduate to the research frontier.

Nanotechnology: Basic Calculations for Engineers and Scientists-a logical follow-up to the author's previous text, Nanotechnology: Environmental Implications and Solutions-presents a practical overview of nanotechnology in a unique workbook format.    The author has developed nearly 300 problems that provide a clear understanding of this growing field in four distinct areas of study:   Chemistry fundamentals and principles   Particle technology   Applications   Environmental concerns    These problems have been carefully chosen to address the most important basic concepts, issues, and applications within each area, including such topics as patent evaluation, toxicology, particle dynamics, ventilation, risk assessment, and manufacturing. An introduction to quantum mechanics is also included in the Appendix. These stand-alone problems follow an orderly and logical progression designed to develop the reader's technical understanding.    ""This is certain to become the pacesetter in the field, a text to benefit both students of all technical disciplines and practicing engineers and researchers.""  -Dr. Howard Beim, Professor of Chemistry, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy    ""Dr. Theodore has covered most of the important nanotechnology subject matter in this ...work through simple, easy-to-follow problems.""  -John McKenna, President and CEO, ETS, Inc.

Olah and his colleagues discuss in a clear and readily accessible manner the use of methanol as a viable alternative to our diminishing fossil fuel resources. They look at the pros and cons of our current main energy sources, namely oil and natural gas, and varied renewable energies, and new ways to overcome obstacles.Following an introduction, Olah, Goeppert and Prakash look at the interrelation of fuels and energy, and at the extent of our non-renewable fossil fuel resources. Despite the diminishing reserve and global warming, the authors point out the continuing need for hydrocarbons and their products. They also discuss the envisioned hydrogen economy and its significant shortcomings. The main section then focuses on the methanol economy, including the conversion carbon dioxide from industrial exhausts (such as flue gases from fossil fuel burning power plants) and carbon dioxide contained in the atmoshere into convenient liquid methanol for fuel uses (notably in fuel cells) and as a raw material for hydrocarbons. The book is rounded off with a glimpse into the future.A forward-looking and inspiring work regarding the major challenges of future energy and environmental problems.

This advancement is due to the Moore's Law increase in computing power as well as the impact of density functional theory (DFT) and its implementation in commercial and freeware programs for quantum chemical calculations. Improved pure and hybrid density functionals are allowing DFT calculations with accuracy comparable to high-level Hartree-Fock treatments, and the results of these calculations can now be evaluated based on experiment.      When calculations are correlated to and supported by experimental data they can provide fundamental insight into electronic structure and its contributions to physical properties and chemical reactivity. This interplay continues to expand and contributes to both improved value of experimental results and improved accuracy of computational predictions.      The purpose of this EIC Book is to provide state-of-the-art presentations of quantum mechanical and related methods and their applications by many of the leaders in the field. Part One of this volume focuses on methods, their background and implementation, and their use in describing bonding properties, energies, transition states and spectroscopic features. Part Two focuses on applications in bioinorganic chemistry and Part Three discusses inorganic chemistry, where electronic structure calculations have already had a major impact. This addition to the EIC Book series is of significant value to both experimentalists and theoreticians, and we anticipate that it will stimulate both further development of the methodology and its applications in the many interdisciplinary fields that comprise modern inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry.

The book fills a crucial gap between solid-state physics and more specialized course texts.The authors first present introductory concepts, including basic semiconductor theory, defect classifications, crystal growth, and doping. They then explain electrical, vibrational, optical, and thermal properties. Moving on to characterization approaches, the text concludes with chapters on the measurement of electrical properties, optical spectroscopy, particle-beam methods, and microscopy.By treating dopants and defects in semiconductors as a unified subject, this book helps define the field and prepares students for work in technologically important areas.

Toxic Chemicals,Thomas E.

While legislation and publicity have reduced the use of some chemicals, risks remain that continue to threaten the health of individuals worldwide. Based on the authors’ research conducted through their development of a program in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Toxic Chemicals: Risk Prevention Through Use Reduction examines various toxicity factors and proposes a plan to reduce the toxic impact of these hazardous substances. Explores all factors that contribute to toxicity The book begins by exploring the history of toxic chemical release reporting programs, a trend growing out of the Bhopal tragedy. It surveys their impact both in the United States through the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program and in the 29 other countries that maintain similar programs. Then, with the goal of developing a rational method of prioritizing toxic chemicals for reduction, the authors discuss mobility, persistence, and bioconcentration adjustment factors and present a method for integrating all of these factors to estimate the relative impact of chemical release. Compares alternate emphases in existing programs The book describes programs that concentrate on reducing the release of chemicals with the greatest adverse toxic impact and those that require companies to prepare pollution prevention plans and set goals for reducing use or release. It also examines technical assistance programs that help companies search for alternative chemicals to use or process changes that eliminate the use of toxic chemicals. In addition, it explores alternative market-based approaches for achieving environmental protection. Presents a workable plan for the future In the final chapters, the authors lay out their proposed program for reducing the use of toxic chemicals. This plan builds on the existing TRI program and uses lessons learned from this and other programs. The combined research assembled by the authors and their multifaceted approach to the issue of chemical toxicity enables companies and policy makers to move to the next level of toxic chemical use reduction, resulting in a safer environment for future generations.

Only a basic familiarity with mathematics is assumed. It is intended both as an elementary text for the beginner as well as a reference for the more experienced. It incorporates the newer methods such as orthogonal collocation, unequal intervals, hopscotch, Runge-Kutta integration of semidiscretised systems of equations, and implicit boundary value calculation, which is required for the Crank-Nicolson technique to be effective in this field, where derivative boundary conditions are the rule. This second edition has been updated extensively to take into account recent developments in the area. It also deals squarely with the problems resulting from homogenous chemical reactions. With the help of this book and its many programming examples, any electrochemist should be able to learn to use the technique quickly in its simpler forms and will hopefully be stimulated to learn about the more difficult methods later.

The first part of the book analyzes primary and secondary properties of particles and particulate systems, focusing on their characterization and the effects on selection and design of silos and conveyors. Covering the main industrial operations of dry solids processing, the second part offers insight into the operation principles of the most important technologies that handle dry solids in bulk. With an emphasis on two-phase and multiphase flow, the final part describes all of the relevant systems in industrial processes that combine two different components of the state of matter as well as technologies for separating phases by purely mechanical means.Through clear explanations of theoretical principles and practical laboratory exercises, this book provides an understanding of the behavior of powders and pulverized systems. It also helps readers develop skills for operating, optimizing, and innovating particle processing technologies and machinery in order to carry out industrial operations, such as centrifugation, filtration, and membrane separations""--Provided by publisher.  ""Preface The idea of writing this book was conceived many years ago when the author started teaching unit operations in the undergraduate program of chemical engineering at the Autonomous University of Chihuahua, even prior to attend the, then, Postgraduate School of Studies in Powder Technology at the University of Bradford. The importance, relevance and prevailing of the topic of Particle Technology remain up to date. Studies by the Rand Corporation in the 1980s identified substantial differences in the scale-up and start-up performance of plants processing powders versus those processing liquids or gases. Particularly, in 1985, the Rand Report surveyed 40 US plants and found out that start-up times were 200-300% of those predicted (compared to 20% for fluid based plants) and only achieved approximately 50% of their designed throughput. By comparison, most fluid-based processes reached 90% of planned output over the same period. Some of the reasons described on the time of the report were related to an inadequate understanding of the behavior of particle systems, which is sensitive to process scale or process history in ways that would not be expected by engineers familiar only with liquid or gas systems. The response to overcome these difficulties came in the way of promoting research, programs of study, and other activities in the field of powder or particle technology worldwide. Substantial advancements have been achieved through all these initiatives but, apparently, many of the reported reasons for these unequal understanding of powder-based processes, as compared to fluid-based processes, remain up to these days. This perception can be implied by a current need of consultancy in the subject by different types of industries worldwide""--Provided by publisher.

The information presented will assist you in responding to specific chemical spills, including identifying the exact chemicals involved and their individual hazards.  The chapters are organized by the nine U.S. Department of Transportation's hazard classes. Within each class, the author discusses individual chemicals that are commonly involved in emergency situations along with their physical and chemical characteristics. Additionally, each chapter addresses the multiple perils of hazardous materials, including ""hidden"" hazards.  The top 50 hazardous industrial chemicals are considered throughout the book, together with other hazardous materials. The author also provides incident reports and statistics to underscore the effects that specific chemicals can have on incident outcomes. Furthermore, he delves into the timely concern of dealing with chemical and biological terrorist agents.  This information is extremely valuable in your daily work for the health and safety of yourself and those who rely on you. Hazardous Materials Chemistry for Emergency Responders, Second Edition offers a concise presentation of the topics of most importance. The subject matter is written to be appropriate for response personnel without a strong chemistry background by conveying the information in understandable terms. This book will familiarize you with the basic chemistry a responder needs to understand chemical terminology and communicate with others about the chemicals involved in hazardous materials incidents.

Accelerated by the ever-growing power of computers and new computational methods, it is one of the fastest growing fields in science these days. Its predictive power in atomic and subatomic scales benefits all disciplines of science, and materials science is definitely one of them. Note that, for example, materials under extreme conditions such as high temperature or pressure, high radiation, on a very small scale, can be rather easily examined via the keyboard in computational materials science. Computational science has been a familiar subject in physics and chemistry, but in the materials field it was considered of secondary importance. It is now in the mainstream, and we have to catch up with the knowledge accumulated in the subject, which strongly involves physics and mathematics. Here, we are forced to deal with an obvious question: how much catch-up will be enough to cover the major topics and to perform computational works as materials researchers? Dealing with the entire field might be most desirable, but many certainly prefer to cover only the essential and necessary parts and would rather be involved in actual computational works. That is what this book is all about. As listed in the Further Readings sections in several chapters, a number of excellent and successful books are already available in this field. However, they are largely physics- or chemistry-oriented, full of theories, algorisms, and equations. It is quite difficult, if not impossible, for materials students to follow all those topics in detail""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although there are numerous procedures set forth by regulatory agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for effectively and safely dealing with such environmental hazards, up until now there has been no single resource for training in this area.    Based on the author's twenty-plus years of field experience, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Manual is a comprehensive text that covers the complete curriculum requirements set forth by OSHA and HazWOPER. Highly accessible and broad in focus, the book is equally useful as a technical resource for training, a hands-on reference for field operations, and a textbook for environmental courses in a variety of areas.    Coverage includes:Methods recommended by professional societies and regulatory agencies including the National Fire Protection Association, OSHA, EPA, and NIOSHPractical examples and assignments in each chapter to supplement the text and enhance usefulness to students   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Drawing on family documents, Quinn sheds new light on the tragic losses and patriotic passion that infused Marie Sklodowska Curie's early years in Poland. And through access to Marie Curie's journal, closed to researchers until 1990, we hear in her own words of the intimacy and joy of her marriage to Pierre Curie and the depth of her despair at his premature death. The image of Marie Curie as the grieving widow, attired always in black, is familiar to many of us. Much less well known is the affair with a married colleague that helped her recover from her loss. The testimonials of friends, hitherto unavailable, lend this love story a sometimes painful immediacy. Marie Curie's public triumphs are well known: she was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and one of the few people, to date, to receive a second. Unknown or barely known are the defeats she suffered: her rejection by the French Academy and her public humiliation at the hands of the French press over her love affair. As a scientist, Marie Curie has always been associated with the discovery of radium and polonium. But in fact more important than her work in isolating new elements was her idea that radioactivity was ""an atomic process."" Susan Quinn's biography provides a closer look at Marie Curie's work, and at the discoveries that led up to it and flowed from it. We come away understanding that Marie Curie was important but not singular: one of a small group of brilliant scientists whose combined efforts brought us to our current understanding of the material universe.

The author defines the inlet and outlet streams and process variables for a distillation column and then explains the overall concept of the separation and purification that is performed. Performance and product quality are described in terms of specification requirements, and tools and techniques for the optimization of quality performance are provided. Figures and graphs are included within the reference to illustrate concepts""--  ""This book is written from a perspective that was developed as the result of 37 years of industrial research at The Dow Chemical Company that focused on inventing, developing and implementing industrial separation and purification processes. The work process for research and development is the scientific method as follows: The Scientific Method 1) Define the problem and the opportunity. 2) Search and understand the state-of-the-art. 3) Develop a hypothesis, i.e. a concept or a model. 4) Design and run experiments to test the validity of the hypothesis. 5) Evaluate, summarize and document the results. The main problem in distillation process control is to separate and purify chemical components in liquid and vapor streams while shedding the disturbances that are imposed on the distillation column. The opportunity is to separate the components from a feed stream into new vapor and liquid streams that have increased economic value at a cost that is competitive with other producers. Conducting research in a large corporation provides the opportunity to apply the results of improved performance to many distillation towers in many different businesses""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hydroxyapatite Coatings for Biomedical Applications,Sam Zhang,chemistry,First published in 2013,/works/OL21255130W,/authors/OL3756216A/Sam_Zhang,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Taylor & Francis,"Hydroxyapatite coatings are of great importance in the biological and biomedical coatings fields, especially in the current era of nanotechnology and bioapplications. With a bonelike structure that promotes osseointegration, hydroxyapatite coating can be applied to otherwise bioinactive implants to make their surface bioactive, thus achieving faster healing and recovery. In addition to applications in orthopedic and dental implants, this coating can also be used in drug delivery. Hydroxyapatite Coatings for Biomedical Applications explores developments in the processing and property characterization and applications of hydroxyapatite to provide timely information for active researchers and newcomers alike. In eight carefully reviewed chapters, hydroxyapatite experts from the United States, Japan, Singapore, and China present the latest on topics ranging from deposition processes to biomedical applications in implants and drug delivery. This book discusses: Magnetron sputtering and electrochemical deposition The modification of hydroxyapatite properties by sol–gel deposition to incorporate other elements found in natural bones, such as zinc, magnesium, and fluorine The use of pure hydroxyapatite in drug delivery applications The growth or self-assembly of hydroxyapatite on shape memory alloy Hydroxyapatite composite coatings—with carbon nanotubes, titanium dioxide (TiO2), and others—on the titanium alloy Offering valuable insights and a wealth of data, including numerous tables and figures, this is a rich source of information for research on hydroxyapatite coatings. Each chapter also covers material that provides an accessible stepping stone for those who are new to the field.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this course we examine the undertaking of developing biotechnology products, focusing on the scientific and management skills of biomanufacturing, clinical trials, non-clinical studies, project management, quality assurance, quality control, and regulatory affairs. The course emphasizes both operational planning for success and integration of plans and efforts in these seven functional areas. The instructors realized from their experience in the biotechnology industry the great need to carefully plan and fully integrate biotechnology development projects. The course is taught in that manner and this book reflects that philosophy with the outcome is a practical guide for students and for those employed or interested in biotechnology""--Provided by publisher.

This book describes the theoretical background to several variants of these Monte Carlo methods and gives a systematic presentation from which newcomers can learn to perform such simulations and to analyze their results. This fourth edition has been updated and a new chapter on Monte Carlo simulation of quantum-mechanical problems has been added. To help students in their work a special web server has been installed to host programs and discussion groups (http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de). Prof. Binder was the winner of the Berni J. Alder CECAM Award for Computational Physics 2001.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Unique among current quantum chemistry texts, Electronic Structure Modeling: Connections Between Theory and Software enables nonspecialists to employ computational methods in their own investigations.     The text illustrates theoretical methods with numerical detail and model calculations. It clarifies what these modeling programs can do, their known pathologies, which ones are suited for specific kinds of projects, and how to reproduce them using the accompanying PC-LOBE bundled software. While elucidating gradient-based molecular structure optimization, the text reviews notable successes and unsolved problems or failures in electronic structure modeling. It also describes the theory and computation of circular dichroism and optical rotation, including magnetically induced optical phenomena.    Offering an accessible introduction to computational methods, Electronic Structure Modeling permits users to practice modeling with a full understanding of the algorithms that support their calculations.

Because BioMEMS research and development require the input of experts who use different technical languages and come from varying disciplines and backgrounds, scientists and students can avoid potential difficulties in communication and understanding only if they possess a skill set and understanding that enables them to work at the interface of engineering and biosciences.Keeping this duality in mind throughout, BioMEMS: Science and Engineering Perspectives supports and expedites the multidisciplinary learning involved in the development of biomicrosystems. Divided into nine chapters, it starts with a balanced introduction of biological, engineering, application, and commercialization aspects of the field. With a focus on molecules of biological interest, the book explores the building blocks of cells and viruses, as well as molecules that form the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), linkers, and hydrogels used for making different surfaces biocompatible through functionalization. The book also discusses: Different materials and platforms used to develop biomicrosystems Various biological entities and pathogens (in ascending order of complexity) The multidisciplinary aspects of engineering bioactive surfaces Engineering perspectives, including methods of manufacturing bioactive surfaces and devices Microfluidics modeling and experimentation Device level implementation of BioMEMS concepts for different applications. Because BioMEMS is an application-driven field, the book also highlights the concepts of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro total analysis system (ơTAS), along with their pertinence to the emerging point-of-care (POC) and point-of-need (PON) applications""--Provided by publisher.  ""Preface We are proud to present this book as an attempt to bridge different areas that constitute the field of biomicroelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS), often called biomicrosystems. The field of BioMEMS has been growing rapidly since the early 1990s due to the advancements in microtechnologies that could cater to the vast application requirements of bio areas. The potential of BioMEMS suits this technology for many applications, including clinical and environmental diagnostics, drug delivery, agriculture, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, chemical synthesis, etc. It is foreseen that BioMEMS will have a deep impact on many aspects of the life science operations and functionalities in the near future. Scientists and students that work in the field of BioMEMS will need to have knowledge and skills at the interface between engineering and biosciences. Development of a BioMEMS device usually involves many scientists and students from various disciplines, such as biosciences, medicine, biochemistry, engineering, physics, etc. One could anticipate many communication and understanding issues that would arise among these people with varied expertise and training. The methods, details, and languages of training are quite different for the students and researchers of engineering and biosciences. As a result, researchers and students involved with multidisciplinary projects like BioMEMS undergo an interesting and refreshing learning on multidisciplinary subjects along the project development. This book aims to support and expedite the multidisciplinary learning involved with the development of biomicrosystems, from both bioscience and engineering perspectives""--Provided by publisher.

This introductory textbook contains not only the foundations and many applications of quantum mechanics, but also new aspects and their experimental verification. It has as its particular virtues clarity and conciseness of presentation, while at the same time being self-contained. Comprehensibility is further guaranteed by the inclusion of all the mathematical steps required for a complete understanding. Carefully chosen problems help to consolidate the student's knowledge. In the introductory chapters, starting from the historical evolution of the subject, the fundamental postulates are developed inductively by means of an interference experiment. Thereafter the structure is purely deductive, covering all of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, plus the quantization of the radiation field in the context of optical transitions. As well as the quantum mechanical ""essentials"", for instance, detailed treatments of scattering theory, time dependent phenomena, and the density matrix, such topics as the theory of quantum mechanical measurement and the Bell inequality are dis- cussed. A separate chapter is devoted to supersymmetric quantum mechanics, an area which to date has been accessible only in the research literature.

The Second Edition of Ronald F. Probstein's Physicochemical Hydrodynamics is significantly expanded and revised to provide increased coverage of the field. All of the material was supplemented with problems for students, and a solutions manual is available for instructors. The continued demand for the book necessitates that the Second Edition be reprinted in paperback so that it may be more widely available to students and practitioners.   This highly respected book emphasizes rational theory and its consequences to demonstrate the underlying unity of PCH, which allows diverse phenomena to be described in physically and mathematically similar ways. Physicochemical Hydrodynamics communicates the fundamentals while, at the same time, conveying the importance of applications of PCH to a variety of fields, including: mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering; materials science, biotechnology, microfluidics, and fluid aspects of nanotechnology. Numerous illustrations, analogies, and examples highlight the text and help to clarify and solidify students' and professionals' understanding of the material.

It will attract ukiyo-e lovers, cat lovers, and also provides valuable inspiration to designers or illustrators.  Kuniyoshi Utagawa (1797-1861) was one of the great masters of the Japanese ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting. Born in 1797 to a silk-dyer, he helped his father's business as a pattern designer. His drawing talent from an early age attracted the attention of the famous print master Toyokuni Utagawa, and Kuniyoshi became one of his apprentices in 1811. The range of Kuniyoshi's preferred subjects included many genres: landscapes, beautiful women, Kabuki actors, mythical animals, and cats. More than any other Japanese artist, Kuniyoshi depicted cats humorously and satirically, with great accuracy and careful observation.  Nobuhisa Kaneko a curatorial staff of the Fuchu Art Museum, Tokyo. He was born in 1962 in Tokyo and specializes in the history of Edo period (1600-1868) painting. He is the author of Tabi suru Edo kaiga: Rimpa kara dohanga made ( Travelling Edo painting: from Rinpa school to copperplate; PIE Books, 2010) and a co-author of Bessatsu Taiyo Edo Kaiga Nyumon (An Introduction to Edo Painting; Heibonsha, 2007.

And though the changing colors of fall are a beauty to behold, this year the scattered leaves hide a grim surprise. Autumn is in the air in the Blue Ridge Mountain community of Crozet, Virginia--and all the traditions of the changing seasons are under way. Mary Minor ""Harry"" Haristeen cleans her cupboards, her husband, Fair, prepares the horses for the shorter days ahead, and the clamorous barking of beagles signals the annual rabbit chase through the central Virginia hills. But the last thing the local beaglers and their hounds expect to flush out is a dead body. Disturbingly, it's the second corpse to turn up, after that of a missing truck driver too disfigured to identify. The deaths seem unrelated--until Harry picks up a trail of clues dating back to the state's post-Revolutionary past. The echoes of the Shot Heard Round the World pale in comparison to the dangerous shootout Harry narrowly escapes unscathed. Next time, it may be the killer who gets lucky. But not if Harry's furry friends Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker can help it. Lending their sharp-nosed talents to the hunt, they'll help their mistress keep more lives from being lost--and right an injustice buried since the early days of America's independence.

He wants us to use what actually works, not just what Western science or alternative medicine say ?should? work. This multifaceted approach to health is known as integrative medicine. Dr. Richter examines traditional medicine from many cultures alongside modern medical techniques, describing the best of complementary care and the best of conventional veterinary medicine. Every treatment he recommends has the backing of scientific research or years of successful outcomes in his clinical practice. After explaining the treatment, he offers specific recommendations for an integrative approach to common diseases, including allergies, skin conditions, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. A holistic approach to health includes nutrition, as it sets up the foundation for your pet?s health. Dr. Richter cuts through the hype in the pet-food world and explains how to choose the best commercial foods and supplements, and even includes both raw and cooked dog- and cat-food recipes for general diet as well as to treat specific needs. He also explains how we can use the right foods and supplements to ?hack? the body?s processes, including the immune system.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Despite their many obvious differences, the seven are determined to get along. After getting to know each other a little better, the seven find inspiration in their diversity and decide to work together toward a common goal: art. Each discovers a unique talent, and they start planning. They're going to team up, pool their resources, and go on tour enjoying the experience of life as artists sharing their special talents with the world. But things aren't as simple as they seem, and the seven cousins are forced to really stretch their limits in order to make their way. It takes more than sheer determination, but with high spirits and a little help from the universe in the form of a hummingbird charm, they find that anything is possible. Conflict erupts, but serendipity shines as this contemporary fable about animal wisdom, resilience, and creativity unfolds.""--Page 4 of cover.

The trouble begins when Harry’s dear friend Miranda Hogendobber takes her on a leisurely drive that ends in a narrow drainage ditch. The chaos continues when the Very Reverend Herbert Jones’s Chevy pickup also abruptly goes kaput. But these vehicular mishaps are nothing compared to the much more distressing state of a mechanic discovered by Harry in a local repair shop: His head’s been bashed in. Despite numerous warnings from her much-loved coterie of friends, human and otherwise, Harry quickly surmises that the time has come to pop the hood and conduct her own investigation. Her animal companions see disaster fast approaching but can do little except try their best to protect their foolishly intrepid human. Harry’s race to the truth leads straight to powerful forces determined to avoid scrutiny at any cost—even if it means running Harry Haristeen off the road for good.

James was living hand to mouth on the streets of London and the last thing he needed was a pet.  Yet James couldn't resist helping the strikingly intelligent tom cat, whom he quickly christened Bob. He slowly nursed Bob back to health and then sent the cat on his way, imagining he would never see him again. But Bob had other ideas.  Soon the two were inseparable and their diverse, comic and occasionally dangerous adventures would transform both their lives, slowly healing the scars of each other's troubled pasts.

Research has found that petting a cat can lower blood pressure and a cat's purr is thought to help heal body tissues and bones. But not just any cat can be a therapy cat, after all, such animals need to be friendly with strangers and willing to be touched, petted and held by unfamiliar people. They have to be tolerant ofloud voices and angry shouting, emotional distress, and sudden movements. It's a tall order for any animal,but a particular challenge for a cat.  In Purr Therapy, psychotherapist and cat lover Dr. Kathleen McCoy shows how two very special cats rose to this challenge, how they helped wounded souls to heal and how they taught even her lessons in mindfulness, joyful living, and compassion. She also shows readers how animal-assisted psychotherapy works and gives them an intimate and moving inside look at how Timmy and Marina worked with patients, how their double role as animal companions and cotherapists changed lives, and how, after their untimely deaths, the grief shared by those who knew and loved them led to even more growth and healing.  It's no surprise that there is a tidal wave of cat fanciers growing: even the internet prefers cats. No dog site has reached the proportions of the most popular cat sites--case in point: the mega-star Grumpy Cat who has over 2-million followers! More than an internet trend, this very active market is exploding through cat video contests and festivals that are claiming the passions of millions who will benefit from--and love--Purr Therapy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As feline collaborators go, you couldn't ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown."" The New York Times Book Review. With the New Year just around the corner, winter has transformed the cozy Blue Ridge Mountain community of Crozet, Virginia, into a living snow globe. It's the perfect setting for Mary Minor Harry Haristeen to build a new work shed designed by her dear friend local architect Gary Gardner. But the natural serenity is shattered when out of the blue, right in front of Harry and Deputy Cynthia Cooper, and in broad daylight, Gary is shot to death by a masked motorcyclist. Outraged by the brazen murder, Harry begins to burrow into her friend's past--and unearths a pattern of destructive greed reaching far back into Virginia's post-Revolutionary history. When Harry finds incriminating evidence, the killer strikes again. Heedless of her own safety and survival, Harry follows a trail of clues to a construction site in Richmond, where the discovery of ancient remains has recently halted work. Aided as always by her loyal if opinionated companions--crime-solving cats Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, and Tee Tucker the Corgi--Harry hunts for a link between the centuries-old dead and the recently, violently deceased. And while other deaths are narrowly averted in a flurry of fur and limbs, the killer remains at large--ever more desperate and dangerous. The deep-rooted legacy of corruption that's been exposed can never be buried again. But if Harry keeps pursuing the terrible truth, she may be digging her own grave""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Under the Colony's watchful eye, this utopia will be free of the humans' penchant for violence, exploitation and religious superstition. The final step in the Colony's war effort is transforming the surface animals into high-functioning two-legged beings who rise up to kill their masters.  Former housecat turned war hero, Mort(e) is famous for taking on the most dangerous missions and fighting the dreaded human bio-weapon EMSAH. But the true motivation behind his recklessness is his ongoing search for a pre-transformation friend—a dog named Sheba. When he receives a mysterious message from the dwindling human resistance claiming Sheba is alive, he begins a journey that will take him from the remaining human strongholds to the heart of the Colony, where he will discover the source of EMSAH and the ultimate fate of all of earth's creatures.""

This cozy series has everything you seek: an eclectic cast of characters, a mystery or two, and diligent detectives on duty. Oh. Did I forget to mention the detectives are feline and canine? The series, Tiger Lily's Café, is set in a Midwestern town nestled into the coast of a Great Lake. The setting itself acts as a character, bringing the reader into the sights, sounds and smells of the small resort community of Chelsea. Read the series in order, or read any book alone. Each volume stands alone with a clear beginning and a clear end. Volume One of the series, Turtle Soup, introduces the reader to Annie, a woman whose ownership of a prime piece of real estate and several businesses was, well, almost a mistake. But own it, she does, and she makes the best of an idyllic situation. With her family of rescue cats and a diverse collection of business managers, staff and friends, Annie embraces her home on The Avenue, a picturesque slice of life that embodies the best--and sometimes the worst--that humanity has to offer. In Turtle Soup, Annie's Café is in trouble. Several issues have marred otherwise pristine reviews from the Health Department. Annie can't figure out what is happening or why. In the meantime, a not-so-very-good friend, Geraldine, has opened a diner that looks remarkably like the Café. Geraldine seems to benefit from Annie's problems. Annie is blind, but Tiger Lily, the oldest of Annie's cats, is wise to Geraldine’s deception. A group of guests arrive at Annie's bed and breakfast. They appear to be typical 'beautiful people.' They have pre-booked an extended fishing cruise on the lake but arrive early to spend a few days in town. Intrigue seems to follow them. The intrigue turns darker, and through the efforts of another of Annie's cats, Little Socks, the depth of their depravity is eventually made known to Annie and her friends. But is it too late? Tiger Lily and her siblings, along with their canine friends Jock and Cyril, are wise to the dangers lurking around Chelsea, but they can't seem to make their humans understand. The humans are in the soup. They just don't know it""--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Our hero, Sgt. ""Perky"" Perkins, and his buddies Bota and Rats continue their recon mission deep in the bloody jungles of Vietnam. In this volume Perky begins to see the moral complexity of the war. He witnesses the French, Chinese, and Japanese military involvement in the war, and beneath it all, he sees the suffering of the Vietnamese civilians. While he and his buddies are on R&R in Saigon, Rats gets in trouble with an MP and ends up on a forced military leave of absence. He goes to visit his family in New York City, where (by witnessing various anti-war demonstrations and talking with his childhood friends) he gets a taste of how the American public feels about the war. While Rats is away, Perky and Bota are captured by the Viet Cong and held as prisoners of war. Rats hurries back to Vietnam to join the rescue effort. Perky is a real hero and is loved and respected by his American buddies and their South Vietnamese counterparts. They are not going to let Perky and Bota go down without giving it their all!

Mais voilà que la vie lui fait cadeau d'Henri, un bambin qui hurle sans arrêt, qui brise ses jouets et qui multiplie les bêtises. Et sa maman qui compte sur lui pour veiller sur son cadet jusqu'à ce qu'il sache voler comme il faut! Avec l'aide de Roselyne, la petite truie, Caramba réussira-t-il à gagner l'estime et la confiance d'Henri, puis à le guider dans sa découverte et son apprentissage de la vie, lui qui est le seul chaton de la planète à ne pas savoir voler?

Mais quel bonheur de voir ses efforts récompensés par de gros câlins, un premier sourire et une petite voix qui ronronne son prénom en guise de tout premier mot! Des aquarelles teintées d'onirisme illustrent le tout avec une grâce poétique en campant les adorables protagonistes rondouillets dans des paysages côtiers bucoliques, jalonnés de quenouilles, de fleurs et de hautes herbes qui se balancent au gré du vent sous l'oeil des hérons, des mouettes et des libellules.

Suzy soon became a key family member, and has traveled with the author to Delaware, Illinois, Wisconsin, both Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri, often on visits to Native American reservations. A frequent flyer, Suzy has also journeyed to Poland nine times, often in the company of Claude, another adopted stray. During these travels, Suzy, sociable and popular, introduced her owners to many new experiences and a range of new friends and acquaintances; not just other cats and humans, but also dogs, opossums, and armadillos.  In a life full of animals, Suzy’s owners have had to confront many of the dilemmas that cat ownership brings; from the difficulties of identifying responsible homes for a litter of kittens to the pain of handling an animal’s death. They have also found many surprising moments of joy, especially in observing the lives and interactions of the many stray cats that share our neighborhoods.  This is the story of a deepening relationship between a couple and their cat, written by an award-winning author, and filled with insightful comments about cat behavior and the nature of the human-feline bond. The episodes in this book will delight and inform other “cat people” and will leave readers with a new understanding of the way interactions with animals transform our lives.  COMMENTS  AND  REVIEWS  “I am a cat lover as well as a friend and admirer of Dr.Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm other fine publications and books.         I am sure that all animal lovers will find it truly wonderful, and all thinking people, even if they hate cats, will find it a profound, sensitive, insightful and funny book.        Dr. Aleksandra's understanding of cats, and animals in general, goes beyond our common need for the unconditional love we receive from our pets. It reaches into our deepest feelings and spiritual needs in line with the Taoist and Buddhist philosophy of wisdom and compassion: that the belief in an absolute unity transcends all divergencies, and all life is seen to be but forms of the Primal One.”    Audrey Ronning Topping  “Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boem should be highly commended for writing a book that conveys so well the author’s appreciation and compassion for animals”    Robert Ackerman  “I have always liked cats admiring their grace, cleanliness and even their ""quirks"" that are interesting to say the least. The wonderful story about the very special cat Suzy gave me a new dimension of admiration for cats. Reciprocating with love, devotion and faithfulness is a cat's reward for that given to them by humans. The book by Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm is definitely a ""good read"".     Carl Boehm    .    “I always like dogs and whole my life I had a one around me. Cats - in my opinion - were too self absorbed and aloof. After reading ""On the Road with Suzy: From Cat to Companion"" I decided to have a cat. Now, just one month later, I am in love with him and became a great admirer of all cats. My cat is very independent in a way that I respect him, but he is so loving and giving that I love him. Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm did a miracle with me, and I am very thankful! “    Bill Smart     .  ""Many people would question Aleksandra's and her husband's decision to embark on a 2.5 months motor trip accompanied by their cat Suzy. Cats are generally considered not to enjoy automobile transportation. Then, we learn about thus special feline... calm, collected, warm, friendly; devoted and loving even under what must have been trying situations. Surely, Suzy has to be remarkable, unique and even brave to face challenges most cats never encounter. I can understand how she became a focal point and an integral member of the family. I wish Suzy many, many happy years.     What a beautiful book about the bond between a cat and humans!""     Mary Salkind, The Bond between a cat and humans, ALIBRIS, Sep. 10, 2010     .    “After reading ""On the Road with Suzy"" the first time, I was left with the feeling of why and how could I have always disliked cats as many others do. Surely, no one could dislike the sweet and loving Suzy. So, I reread Aleksandra's book and came to the conclusion that the love, caring and devotion she and her husband extended towards Suzy may have became a challenge to her. Her  qualities of affection and faithfulness were almost like those of a dog but tempered a bit by the normal aloofness and pride of a cat. However, when it was time to be affectionate, loving and faithful, Suzy responded. She is a remarkable feline and most interesting to read about!”    David Keller, GOOGLE BOOKS    .    “If Suzy could talk and probably does in cat language, I believe she would say to Aleksandra and Norman: ""I really love you for taking me in from stray status, for being with me during my pregnancy and birth on my five beautiful kittens, for striving to find good homes for my kittens because it was impossible to keep them, for always having time for me and tolerating my cat quirks and antics, for caring for me in sickness and in health, for always showing your love, affection and pride in me (and bragging about me too). You two are truly cat people, co we are a threesome""     This is a remarkable tale about a wonderful cat! “.   John Carr, ALIBRIS, September 2010  “Doctor Aleksandra is an animal lover. Her compassion for her cat, Suzy, makes this a book of discovery and adventure for all animal lovers.     Suzy found the Boehms, and stalking around their Houston apartment, won their hearts and soon became a member of the family. She accompanied them on trips either by auto or plane, a loving companion.    Aleksandra understood the need of compassion and love for animals, and they related to her. A description of a long cross-country trip with husband, Norman is hilarious, as they must make accommodations before and during the trip. Suzy survives and explores her new surroundings in Delaware. Later on Suzy even flies to Poland with her owners.     This is truly a couple who enjoy and deeply care for the welfare of their animals”.

Not oniy was he one of the few great masters of the difficult art of the short story ; he was also a truly astonishing originator of styles of fiction which have since developed and become important branches of literature.  The present collection contains his best tales of terror, and also of fantasy—and illustrates his amazing originality. Such classics as The Cask of Amontillado, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Fall of the House of Usher, The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar and The Pit and the Pendulum hardly need introduction. They are still among the most horrifying crawlers' (as Stevenson called them) in the language—and not even R.L.S. nor Conan Doyle nor M. R. ames have surpassed them.  The Gold Bug is specially interesting as a finger-post leading to the Treasure Island type of story—of hidden treasure and the deciphering of ingenious clues and codes. Young readers will find excitement and true entertainment in these brilliantly imagined stories. They are matchless of their kind.    --front flap   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But her BFF, Lance, has a makeover in mind, and it’s about to lead to murder . . .  Uber-stylist Bebe Braddock plans to juice up her Instagram feed, and thinks Jaine would make a perfect “Before & After” model. At Lance’s insistence Jaine is ushered into Bebe’s sprawling Brentwood spread to await her transformation. Yet, while the surroundings are glamorous, the atmosphere is toxic as Bebe bullies her team of assistants, and even her husband, into obeying her every whim.  Having earned the wrath of everyone in her orbit, few are shocked when Bebe is found strangled with one of her detested wire hangers. But Jaine’s prints are all over the murder weapon, making her a prime suspect. The police, however, aren’t the only ones showing interest in her—so is Justin, Bebe’s very cute, very young personal assistant. While Jaine navigates a cougar-style romance, Prozac is mistakenly hailed as a feline hero and catapults into internet fame. Still, there are more urgent matters at hand than Prozac’s swelling ego. Because unless Jaine can track down Bebe’s killer and clear her own name, the only new outfit she’ll be modeling is an orange prison jumpsuit. . .

As well as being highly enjoyable, Poe's tales are works of very real intellectual exploration. Using the Gothic to question the integrity of human existence, Poe is less interested in moral retribution than in exposing the misconceptions that make things seem 'mysterious' in the first place. Attentive to the historical and political dimensions of these very American tales, this new critical edition selects twenty-four tales and places the most popular — 'The Fall of the House of Usher', 'The Masque of the Red Death', 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue', and 'The Purloined Letter ' — alongside less well-known travel narratives, metaphysical essays, and political satires.  • INTRODUCTION • TEXTUAL NOTE • BIBLIOGRAPHY • CHRONOLOGY • EXPLANATORY NOTES    --back cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The catch is that another distant relative, wannabe novelist and bonafide cat-hater Jake Winters, has also inherited an interest into the house. Undeterred, Kate and Jeremy move in The downstairs quarters while Jake takes the separate apartment upstairs. Then, when a murder occurs, young Jeremy is the prime suspect...but was he framed? And just what did the cat drag in that might prove Jeremy's innocence—and unmask the real killer?  Entertaining, suspenseful, not cliched - you cannot predict what happens next.

A few, nicknamed leadfeet, are sentenced by a trick of nature or fate to forever spend their lives closer to the ground. But one night, a girl named Gurl -- a leadfoot, an orphan, a nobody -- discovers that she can do something much better than fly. She can become invisible. This amazing power will help her uncover the secret mysteries of the city. But even with her newfound talent, Gurl can't seem to hide from a giant rat man with a taste for cats, a manipulative matron with a penchant for plastic surgery, and a belligerent boy named Bug. Gradually Gurl learns to control her power and teams up with Bug to figure out who and what she is. Their quest will take them on a wild ride through this magical city, where they'll confront chatty birds and mind-bending monkeys, an eccentric genius with a head full of grass and a pocket full of kittens, and the handsome but lethal Sweetcheeks Grabowski -- the gangster who holds the key to Gurl's past ... and the world's future.

Two nights later the bubbly couple announces their engagement, but the news is quickly overshadowed the next morning by the discovery of Graham's body with an ice pick protruding from his chest...Between hiding a furry fugitive, flirting with Emily's nephew Robbie, and baiting the hook for a clever murderer, Jaine is about to dive into her most dangerous case yet...

But when a grumpy neighbor gets himself iced, she'll have to find the culprit or she may spend the New Year in jail...  Scotty Parker is a former child star who once played Tiny Tim, but now he's grown up into the role of neighborhood Scrooge. He cuts the wires on his neighbors' Christmas lights and tells local kids that Santa had a stroke. And his miserly, bah-humbug attitude lasts year-round -- a fact known all too well by his current wife, his ex-wife, his maid, and many more.  Scotty thinks he can stage a comeback with the screenplay he's working on (The Return of Tiny Tim: Vengeance Is Mine!), and Jaine's been reluctantly helping him edit it. So when Scotty is bludgeoned with a frozen chocolate yule log and the police start making a list of suspects and checking it twice, Jaine's name is unfortunately included. True, she's been under some stress, with Lance trying to set her up on dates and her fickle feline taking a sudden liking to someone else -- but she's not guilty of murder. Now she just has to prove it, by using her gift for detection and figuring out who committed this holiday homicide.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He became the scourge and darling of the reporters, photographers, videographers, bloggers, and radio hosts who clamored to meet him--dragging his hapless human behind him as he greeted fame with his usual joie de vivre and occasional 'catitude.' He became a spokes-cat for the cause of special-needs animals everywhere, and eventually the wise older mentor to the new special-needs kitten who would enter his and Gwen's lives. Most importantly, Homer taught those who loved him best how to live and die with strength, dignity, and joy--and left behind a rescue community of 'Homer's Heroes' that continues to save countless lives in his name""--Back cover.

Her mum and dad decide that she is definitely responsible enough to have her very own puppy -- so take her to Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, where she meets Bertie the West Highland terrier. Poor Bertie hasn't been treated very well by his previous owners, so is very thin and frightened, with patchy fur. Laura wants to take Bertie home, look after him and make him bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Her big sister Leah can't understand why she doesn't prefer a pampered pooch to fit in her handbag, and Leah's snooty friends tease Laura in the park one day, but she doesn't care. Bertie is the best dog in the world! And when he sounds the warning and averts a house fire, can he persuade Leah to give him a chance, too?"" --Amazon.com.
