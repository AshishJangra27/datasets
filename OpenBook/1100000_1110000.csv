Millions of American jobs have been sent overseas and aren't coming back. Young African-American men make up the majority of America's prison population. Half of the American population are poor or near poor, living precariously on the brink, while the top one percent own as much as the bottom eighty. Government police-state spying on its citizens is pervasive. Consequently, as former President Jimmy Carter has said, ""we have no functioning democracy."" Imagine : Living In a Socialist USA, edited by Francis Goldin, Debby Smith, and Michael Steven Smith, is at once an indictment of American capitalism as the root cause of our spreading dystopia and a cri de coeur for what life could be like in the United States if we had economic as well as a real political democracy. This anthology features essays by revolutionary thinkers, activists, and artists--including Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore, civil rights activist Angela Davis, incarcerated journalist Mumia Abu Jamal, and economist Rick Wolff--addressing various aspects of a new society and, crucially, how to get from where we are now to where we want to be, living in a society that is truly fair and just.

In this incisive new analysis, leading expert on Soviet and Russian foreign policy, Robert Legvold, explores in detail this qualitatively new phase in a relationship that has alternated between hope and disappointment for much of the past two decades. Tracing the long and tortured path leading to this critical juncture, he contends that the recent deterioration of Russia-U.S. relations deserves to be understood as a return to cold war with great and lasting consequences. In drawing out the commonalities between the original cold war and the current confrontation, Return to Cold War brings a fresh perspective to what is happening between the two countries, its broader significance beyond the immediate issues of the day, and how political leaders in both countries might adjust their approaches in order, as the author urges, to make this new cold war ""as short and shallow as possible.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this book, Australia's leading specialist on migration James Jupp surveys the changes in policy over the last thirty years since the seismic shift away from the White Australia Policy. Along the way the author considers the history of the White Australia Policy, compares the achievements of the Fraser, Hawke and Keating governments, considers the establishment of the 'institutions' of multiculturalism and ethnicity, and then the waves of attacks on multiculturalism. It looks critically at the impact of economic rationalism on migration choices, the environmentalist challenges to migration, and the impact of Pauline Hanson and One Nation. Most importantly the vexed issue of refugees and asylum seekers is covered in great depth.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It analyzes formal political institutions, in particular the relationship between democracy and human development. It also centers on informal social institutions leading to the exclusion of population groups such as women and indigenous people. To measure these institutions in the case of gender inequality the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) and its five subindices are proposed and for the indigenous «disadvantage» the indigenous dummy is used. The dissertation shows that formal and informal institutions affect human development, the governance of a society and inequality.

Effects of EU Enlargement to the Central European Countries on Agricultural Markets,Wolfgang Münch,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500122W,/authors/OL8908732A/Wolfgang_Münch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 242,"Accession of the Central and Eastern European Countries is one of the biggest political projects for the European Union. As in all previous enlargements the agricultural chapter proves to be one of the most sensitive fields of the negotiations. This book examines the effects of enlargement on agricultural markets and government expenditure in the candidate countries as well as possible effects of different choices in the politically sensitive areas of direct payments and production quotas. The ten candidate countries have quite diverse economic and agricultural characteristics. Membership in the European Union, therefore, leads to varying macroeconomic effects. Two chapters specifically deal with these aspects and their effects on agriculture as well as likely country-specific developments in Hungary and in Slovenia. The quantitative tools developed and used for this analysis have also been more widely used by governments and institutions in analyses of questions related to enlargement. The book describes and documents these quantitative tools.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Im Mittelpunkt steht die Frage, wie sich 11 Jahre nach der {raquo}Wende{laquo} und 10 Jahre nach der Wiedervereinigung der beiden deutschen Staaten der Umbruch in Ostdeutschland gegenwärtig beurteilen lässt im Hinblick auf: den Zusammenbruch des politischen Systems der DDR, die politischen Utopien bzw. der Utopiekritik, die Biographieverläufe von Kindern, Jugendlichen, Erwachsenen und Familien aus dem Osten Deutschlands. In früheren Studien wurde vielfach vermutet, dass der gesellschaftliche Transformationsprozess z.T. prekäre Auswirkungen auf die wirtschaftliche und politische Entwicklung der Neuen Bundesländer haben wird; dass der Verlust politischer Utopien eng im Zusammenhang mit dem Verschwinden der {raquo}Ostblockstaaten{laquo} steht und dass das Leben der Menschen aus dem Osten Deutschlands stark vom gesellschaftlichen Umbruch beeinflusst worden ist und auch weiterhin beeinflusst sein wird. Ob diese Prognosen tatsächlich auch gegenwärtig noch aufrecht zu erhalten sind, wird in diesem Buch aus politikwissenschaftlicher und sozialwissenschaftlicher Sicht diskutiert. In diesem Kontext wird danach gefragt, - welche Thesen von Transformationstheorien sich durch die Untersuchungsergebnisse der einzelnen Arbeiten erhärten lassen und welche mittel- und langfristig kritisch beleuchtet werden müssen, - welchen Einfluss die politische Utopie und Utopiekritik nach dem Zusammenbruch auf die politischen Entwürfe und Perspektiven hat, - wie prekär der Umbruch für die Menschen aus Ostdeutschland tatsächlich verlaufen ist, d.h. wie stark der gesellschaftliche Umbruch in Ostdeutschland die Biographien der Menschen tatsächlich beeinflusst hat.

Getting your way,James M.

Whether you’re seeking a job, negotiating a deal, or angling for that big promotion, you’re engaged in strategic thought and action. In such moments, you imagine what might be going on in another person’s head and how they’ll react to what you do or say. At the same time, you also try to pick the best way to realize your goals, both with and without the other person’s cooperation. Getting Your Way teaches us how to win that game by offering a fuller understanding of how strategy works in the real world.As we all know, rules of strategy are regularly discovered and discussed in popular books for business executives, military leaders, and politicians. Those works with their trendy lists of pithy maxims and highly effective habits can help people avoid mistakes or even think anew about how to tackle their problems. But they are merely suggestive, as each situation we encounter in the real world is always more complex than anticipated, more challenging than we had hoped. James M. Jasper here shows us how to anticipate those problems before they actually occur—by recognizing the dilemmas all strategic players must negotiate, with each option accompanied by a long list of costs and risks. Considering everyday dilemmas in a broad range of familiar settings, from business and politics to love and war, Jasper explains how to envision your goals, how to make the first move, how to deal with threats, and how to employ strategies with greater confidence.Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Rosa Parks, Hugo Chavez, and David Koresh all come into play in this smart and engaging book, one that helps us recognize and prepare for the many dilemmas inherent in any strategic action.

Human Rights in Business,Juan José Álvarez Rubio,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL20931766W,/authors/OL9738437A/Juan_José_Álvarez_Rubio,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English,"The capacity to abuse, or in general affect the enjoyment of human, labour and environmental rights has risen with the increased social and economic power    that multinational companies wield in the global economy. At the same time,    it appears that it is difficult to regulate the activities of multinational companies    in such a way that they conform to international human, labour and environmental    rights standards. This has partially to do with the organization of companies    into groups of separate legal persons, incorporated in different states, as    well as with the complexity of the corporate supply chain. Absent a business    and human rights treaty, a more coherent legal and policy approach is required.    Faced with the challenge of how to effectively access the right to remedy in    the European Union for human rights abuses committed by EU companies in    non-EU states, a diverse research consortium of academic and legal institutions    was formed. The consortium, coordinated by the Globernance Institute for    Democratic Governance, became the recipient of a 2013 Civil Justice Action    Grant from the European Commission Directorate General for Justice. A mandate    was thus issued for research, training and dissemination so as to bring    visibility to the challenge posed and moreover, to provide some solutions for    the removal of barriers to judicial and non-judicial remedy for victims of business related    human rights abuses in non-EU states. The project commenced in    September 2014 and over the course of two years the consortium conducted    research along four specific lines in parallel with various training sessions across    EU Member States.    The research conducted focused primarily on judicial remedies, both jurisdictional    barriers and applicable law barriers; non-judicial remedies, both to company based grievance. The results of this research endeavour make up the content of    this report whose aim is to provide a scholarly foundation for policy proposals    by identifying specific challenges relevant to access to justice in the European    Union and to provide recommendations on how to remove legal and practical    barriers so as to provide access to remedy for victims of business-related human    rights abuses in non-EU states.

The authors retain all the substance of their contention that short-term, single-issue analyses cast public policy too narrowly as the result of cozy and dependable arrangements among politicians, interest groups, and the media. Jones and Baumgartner provide a different interpretation by taking the long view of several issues—including nuclear energy, urban affairs, smoking, and auto safety—to demonstrate that bursts of rapid, unpredictable policy change punctuate the patterns of stability more frequently associated with government. Featuring a new introduction and two additional chapters, this updated edition ensures that their findings will remain a touchstone of policy studies for many years to come.""

In a fundamental shift, growing numbers of American Jews have become less willing to unquestioningly support Israel and more willing to publicly criticize its government. More than ever before, American Jews are arguing about Israeli policies, and many, especially younger ones, are becoming uncomfortable with Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Dov Waxman argues that Israel is fast becoming a source of disunity for American Jewry, and that a new era of American Jewish conflict over Israel is replacing the old era of solidarity. Drawing on a wealth of in-depth interviews with American Jewish leaders and activists, Waxman shows why Israel has become such a divisive issue among American Jews. He delves into the American Jewish debate about Israel, examining the impact that the conflict over Israel is having on Jewish communities, national Jewish organizations, and on the pro-Israel lobby. Waxman sets this conflict in the context of broader cultural, political, institutional, and demographic changes happening in the American Jewish community. He offers a nuanced and balanced account of how this conflict over Israel has developed and what it means for the future of American Jewish politics. Israel used to bring American Jews together. Now it is driving them apart. Trouble in the Tribe explains why""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book is underpinned by a series of case studies in the US and Europe that demonstrate the application of 'electronic democracy' in a number of city and civic projects.Cyberdemocracy provides a balanced and considered evaluation of the potential for ""electronic democracy"" based on empirical research.

From raising taxes on those with annual incomes over $250,000, to shifting money toward the schools of poor children, from seeking environmental alliances with other countries to limit global warming, to the rejection of military solutions to the problems posed by illegal immigration, California has been a laboratory of innovation. These are clear, if not always consistent, indications that Californians are not content to pursue the ""race to the bottom"" right-wing philosophy that has gone mostly unchallenged since the fall of the Communism. That model of endorsing privatization, deregulation, and reductions in government spending, eschewing subsidies, minimal government interference in business, and a tax system that disproportionately favors the wealthy, is exemplified by Rick Perry's vision for Texas and rejected by the pragmatic liberal Jerry Brown. This liberal mindset, forged in the crucible of the tumultuous last half century, is California's true contribution to not only the county, but the world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The resistance to this biopiracy--the use of intellectual property systems to legitimize the exclusive ownership and control over biological resource and biological products and processes that have been used over centuries in non-industrialized cultures--is the struggle to conserve both cultural and biological diversity. Since the land, the forests, the oceans, and the atmosphere have already been colonized, eroded, and polluted, Northern capital is now looking for new colonies to exploit and invade for further accumulation--in Shiva's view, the interior spaces of the bodies of women, plants, and animals. Featuring a new introduction by the author, this edition of Biopiracy is a learned, clear, and passionately stated objection to the ways in which Western businesses are being allowed to expropriate natural processes and traditional forms of knowledge.""--  ""A learned, clear, and passionately stated objection to the ways in which Western businesses are being allowed to expropriate natural processes and traditional forms of knowledge""--Provided by publisher""--   Read more Read less",24 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

There is also no serious hope that global challenges such as climate, inequality or migration can be tackled without scientific research and reflection. Every society and every government is therefore dependent on science. For democracies, however, the question of the relationship between politics and science arises again in a special way, since science there appears to be something that concerns everyone and must therefore be publicly negotiated. The volume 'Public Reason? Science in Democracy 'addresses the question of the difficulties encountered by the ideal of a public and reason-led discourse on the relevance of scientific results in modern democracies. Based on questions as diverse as the problems of scientific policy advice, the relationship between science and the media, the possibilities and limits of citizen science and the role of ethics and politics in the university, the contributions presented open up new perspectives on the complex relationship between science, politics and media and non-media public.

Cultural factors are reshaping how a new generation of voters considers issues. Demographic shifts are creating an increasingly diverse electorate, and technological advances are opening new avenues for voter contact and persuasion. Kristen Soltis Anderson examines these hot-topic trends and how they are influencing the way youth, women, and minorities vote. Blending observations from focus groups, personal stories, and polling results, the Republican pollster offers key insights into the changing nature of American politics. The Selfie Vote introduces you to tech-savvy political consultants and shows you how these hip young pollsters and consultants are using data mining and social media to transform electoral politics--including tracking your purchasing history. Make some purchases at a high-end culinary store? Crave sushi? Your choices outside the ballot box can reveal how you might vote. And anyone interested in the future of politics should know where these cultural trends are heading. Data-driven yet highly readable, The Selfie Vote busts established myths about campaigns and elections while offering insights about what's ahead--and what it could mean for American politics and governance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Governing the North American Arctic,Dawn Alexandrea Berry,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL22321650W,/authors/OL8537698A/Dawn_Alexandrea_Berry,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""Though it has been home for centuries to indigenous peoples who have mastered its conditions, the Arctic has historically proven to be a difficult region for governments to administer. Extreme temperatures, vast distances, and widely dispersed patterns of settlement have made it impossible for bureaucracies based in far-off capitals to erect and maintain the kind of infrastructure and institutions that they have built elsewhere. As climate change transforms the polar regions, this book seeks to explore how the challenges of governance are developing and being met in Alaska, the Canadian Far North, and Greenland, while also drawing upon lessons from the region's past. Though the experience of each of these jurisdictions is unique, their place within democratic, federal systems and the prominence within each of them of issues relating to the rights of indigenous peoples situates them as part of an identifiably 'North American Arctic.' Today, as this volume shows, their institutions are evolving to address contemporary issues of security, environmental protection, indigenous rights, and economic development""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Democracy assistance from the third wave,Paulina Pospieszna,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL23333642W,/authors/OL8184507A/Paulina_Pospieszna,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  University of Pittsburgh Press|Language English|Pages 245,"""The role of Western NGOs in the transition of postcommunist nations to democracy has been well documented. In this study, Paulina Pospieszna follows a different trajectory, examining the role of a former aid recipient (Poland), newly democratic itself, and its efforts to aid democratic transitions in the neighboring states of Belarus and Ukraine.  Belarus is widely regarded as the most authoritarian state in the region, while Ukraine is witnessing a slow, if often troubled, democratic consolidation. Each state presents a different set of challenges to outside agencies. As Pospieszna shows, Poland is uniquely positioned to offer effective counsel on the transition to democracy. With similarities of language and culture, and a shared history, combined with strong civic activism and success within the European Union, Poland's regional policies have successfully combined its need for security and a motivation to spread democracy as primary concerns. Pospieszna details the founding, internal workings, goals, and methods of Poland's aid programs. She then compares the relative degrees of success of each in Belarus and Ukraine and documents the work yet to be done.  As her theoretical basis, Pospieszna analyzes current thinking on the methods and effectiveness of NGOs in transitions to democracy, particularly U.S.- and European-led aid efforts. She then views the applicability of these methods to the case of Poland and its aid recipients. Overwhelmingly, Pospieszna finds the greatest success in developmental programs targeting civil society--workers, intellectuals, teachers, students, and other NGO actors.  Through extensive interviews with government administrators and NGO workers in Poland and the United States, coupled with archival research, Pospieszna assembles an original perspective on the mitigation of the 'postcommunist divide'. Her work will serve as a model for students and scholars of states in transition, and it provides an overview of both successful and unsuccessful strategies employed by NGOs in democracy assistance.

The dictator's dilemma,Bruce J.

Their prediction, however, never proved true. Despite minor setbacks, China has experienced explosive economic growth and relative political stability ever since 1989. In The Dictator's Dilemma, eminent China scholar Bruce Dickson provides a comprehensive explanation for regime's continued survival and prosperity. Dickson contends that the popular media narrative of the party's impending implosion ignores some basic facts. The regime's policies may generate resentment and protest, but the CCP still enjoys a surprisingly high level of popular support. Nor is the party is not cut off from the people it governs. It consults with a wide range of specialists, stakeholders, and members of the general public in a selective yet extensive manner. Further, it tolerates and even encourages a growing and diverse civil society, even while restricting access to it. Today, the majority of Chinese people see the regime as increasingly democratic even though it does not allow political competition and its leaders are not accountable to the electorate. In short, while the Chinese people may prefer change, they prefer that it occurs within the existing political framework. In reaching this conclusion, Dickson draws upon original public opinion surveys, interviews, and published materials to explain why there is so much popular support for the regime. This basic stability is a familiar story to China specialists, but not to those whose knowledge of contemporary China is limited to the popular media. The Dictator's Dilemma, an engaging synthesis of how the CCP rules and its future prospects, will enlighten both audiences, and will be essential for anyone interested in understanding China's increasing importance in world politics""--  ""In The Dictator's Dilemma, eminent China scholar Bruce Dickson explains in highly accessible prose why the Communist Party regime has survived and prospered, despite constant predictions of its weakening and demise""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It surveys neoconservative discourses on democracy, the liberal state, capitalism, national security, international law and global liberal governance, and draws attention to the systematic links between the domestic and international dimensions of neoconservative political sociology. Taking issue with neoconservatism's self-image, Drolet argues and demonstrates that American neoconservatism is not the centrist 'liberal' conservatism that it pretends to be--and that many analysts have diagnosed in recent years. To the extent that neoconservatism is committed to the Enlightenment discourse of liberalism, these commitments are firmly subordinated to an authoritarian form of cultural and philosophical conservatism, which is in fact ferociously predatory on liberal values and practices. Neoconservatism is not a conservative variant of liberalism but a deeply atavistic reaction to liberal modernity. It owes a lot more to the authoritarian intellectual milieu of interwar Europe than to the liberal tradition that its protagonists allegedly want to reform and protect against its enemies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It was spearheaded by activists such as Pauulu Kamarakafego and the Black Beret Cadre. The Cadre maintained relationships with revolutionary organizations across the African diaspora, such as the Black Panthers. Emerging in the late 1960s, the movement witnessed the assassinations of Bermuda's British chief of police and governor (1972-1973). Swan carefully details the island's colonial government's attempts to destroy the movement through military tactics, extensive propaganda, and the implementation of token social concessions""--Provided by publisher.

Aaron Swartz was a zealous young advocate for the free exchange of information and creative content online. He committed suicide in 2013 after being indicted by the government for illegally downloading millions of academic articles from a nonprofit online database. From the age of fifteen, when Swartz, a computer prodigy, worked with Lawrence Lessig to launch Creative Commons, to his years as a fighter for copyright reform and open information, to his work leading the protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), to his posthumous status as a cultural icon, Swartz's life was inextricably connected to the free culture movement. Now Justin Peters examines Swartz's life in the context of 200 years of struggle over the control of information. In vivid, accessible prose, The Idealist situates Swartz in the context of other ""data moralists"" past and present, from lexicographer Noah Webster to ebook pioneer Michael Hart to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the process, the book explores the history of copyright statutes and the public domain; examines archivists' ongoing quest to build the ""library of the future""; and charts the rise of open access, copyleft, and other ideologies that have come to challenge protectionist IP policies. Peters also breaks down the government's case against Swartz and explains how we reached the point where federally funded academic research came to be considered private property, and downloading that material in bulk came to be considered a federal crime. The Idealist is an important investigation of the fate of the digital commons in an increasingly corporatized Internet, and an essential look at the impact of the free culture movement on our daily lives and on generations to come""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Since the time of Columbus, Indian slavery was illegal in much of the American continent. Yet, as Andrés Reséndez illuminates, it was practiced for centuries as an open secret. There was no abolitionist movement to protect the tens of thousands of natives who were kidnapped and enslaved by the conquistadors, then forced to descend into the ""mouth of hell"" of eighteenth-century silver mines or, later, made to serve as domestics for Mormon settlers and rich Anglos. Reséndez builds the case that it was mass slavery--more than epidemics--that decimated Indian populations across North America. New evidence, including testimonies of courageous priests, rapacious merchants, Indian captives, and Anglo colonists, sheds light too on Indian enslavement of other Indians--as what started as a European business passed into the hands of indigenous operators and spread like wildfire across vast tracts of the American Southwest. The Other Slavery reveals nothing less than a key missing piece of American history. For over two centuries we have fought over, abolished, and tried to come to grips with African-American slavery. It is time for the West to confront an entirely separate, equally devastating enslavement we have long failed to see truly.--Adapted from dust jacket.

Despite such horrific aspects of war, evidence suggests that civil war is likely to generate multilayered outcomes. To examine the transformative aspects of civil war, Mehmet Gurses draws on an original survey conducted in Turkey, where a Kurdish armed group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), has been waging an intermittent insurgency for Kurdish self-rule since 1984. Findings from a probability sample of 2,100 individuals randomly selected from three major Kurdish-populated provinces in the eastern part of Turkey, coupled with insights from face-to-face in-depth interviews with dozens of individuals affected by violence, provide evidence for the multifaceted nature of exposure to violence during civil war.

Find out in this ripping, near-futuristic thriller. The United States, China, and Russia eye each other across a twenty-first century version of the Cold War, which suddenly heats up at sea, on land, in the air, in outer space, and in cyberspace. The fighting involves everything from stealthy robotic-drone strikes to old warships from the navy's ""ghost fleet."" Fighter pilots unleash a Pearl Harbor-style attack; American veterans become low-tech insurgents; teenage hackers battle in digital playgrounds; Silicon Valley billionaires mobilize for cyber-war; and a serial killer carries out her own vendetta. Ultimately, victory will depend on blending the lessons of the past with the weapons of the future. Ghost Fleet is a page-turning speculative thriller in the spirit of The Hunt for Red October. The debut novel by two leading experts on the cutting edge of national security, it is unique in that every trend and technology featured in the novel -- no matter how sci-fi it may seem -- is real, or could be soon.

Many find the subject to be boring or confusing, and with good reason. Most of the standard books on research methods fail to highlight the most important concepts and questions. Instead, they brim with dry technical definitions and focus heavily on statistical analysis, slighting other valuable methods. This approach not only dulls potential enjoyment of the course, but prevents students from mastering the skills they need to engage more directly and meaningfully with a wide variety of research. With wit and practical wisdom, Christopher Howard draws on more than a decade of experience teaching research methods to transform a typically dreary subject and teach budding political scientists the critical skills they need to read published research more effectively and produce better research of their own. The first part of the book is devoted to asking three fundamental questions in political science: What happened? Why? Who cares? In the second section, Howard demonstrates how to answer these questions by choosing an appropriate research design, selecting cases, and working with numbers and written documents as evidence. Drawing on examples from American and comparative politics, international relations, and public policy, Thinking Like a Political Scientist highlights the most common challenges that political scientists routinely face, and each chapter concludes with exercises so that students can practice dealing with those challenges.--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Given short shrift or overlooked by many historians, the Hampton Roads Conference of 1865 was a crucial turning point in the War between the States. In this well written and highly documented book, James B. Conroy describes in fascinating detail what happened when leaders from both sides came together to try to end the hostilities. The meeting was meant to end the fighting on peaceful terms. It failed, however, and the war dragged on for two more bloody, destructive months. Through meticulous research of both primary and secondary sources, Conroy tells the story of the doomed peace negotiations through the characters who lived it. With a fresh and immediate perspective, Our One Common Country offers a thrilling and eye-opening look into the inability of our nation's leaders to find a peaceful solution. The failure of the Hamptons Roads Conference shaped the course of American history and the future of America's wars to come""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In particular, this book examines the basis of the power of English Courts to grant such injunctions and explains when such injunctions will be granted. It considers any limitations attached to such injunctions and the relationship between section 44 of the Arbitration Act 1996 and section 37 of the Senior Courts Act 1981. It also provides an in-depth analysis of case law and the emerging trends in this area of arbitration, as well as the powers of arbitrators under the ICC and LCIA Rules to grant such relief and other remedies that might be available to a party seeking to uphold an arbitration agreement.This book will be a vital reference tool for practitioners, arbitrators and postgraduate students.

Empirical Analysis of Poverty Dynamics,Isabel Günther,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500489W,/authors/OL8908828A/Isabel_Günther,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 174,"The empirical analysis of poverty over time is still severely constrained by the available survey data in developing countries. In the past, this has led to a neglect of certain aspects of poverty dynamics or even biased assessments of poverty dynamics. This book explicitly takes into account the present data limitations, proposing alternative methods for the empirical analysis of poverty dynamics. The work addresses both the problems related to limited data in the analysis of macro-level (or national) as well as micro-level (or household) poverty dynamics. The proposed methods are applied to survey data from various sub-Saharan African countries. As these countries do not only have the most limited economic survey data but also show the highest poverty rates in the world an accurate understanding of the underlying poverty dynamics seems to be most important for these countries.

On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs,James V.

Though he does not deny the importance of those necessary and prosaic activities that take up the bulk of our daily lives, Schall puts these pursuits in perspective by asking, what do we do when everything we have to do is done?  Defending the importance of simply wasting time, losing ourselves in play, and Chesterton’s claim that “a thing worth doing is worth doing badly,” Schall contends that the joy that accompanies leisure, festivity, and conviviality gives us a glimpse of the eternal. Such activities also enable us to get beyond ourselves—indeed call us beyond ourselves—and are therefore essential if we are to rightly order our worldly concerns. For as Schall reminds us, neither man nor his projects are the highest things in the universe, and it is only by understanding this fact that man can attain to his true dignity.  Citing Aristotle, Samuel Johnson, Charlie Brown, and New Yorker cartoons with equal sobriety, Schall unfolds a defense of both Being and being, of the radical contingency and therefore goodness of existence itself. On the Unseriousness of Human Affairs is an instructive volume whose countercultural message is of vital importance.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Three sections highlight the themes of tourism; trafficking; strategic locations and public events; and illegal migration. A feature of this book is its commitment to give voice to police practitioners from developing countries and countries where English is a second language. It addresses these difficult yet vitally important areas of crime which are an ongoing global challenge and reflects a compilation of the most current international issues in policing""--  ""PES Preface The International Police Executive Symposium (IPES) was founded in 1994 to address one major challenge--the worlds of research and practice remain disconnected even though cooperation between the two is growing. A major reason is that the two groups speak in different languages. The research is published in hard-to-access journals and presented in a manner that is difficult for some to comprehend. On the other hand, police practitioners tend not to mix with researchers and remain secretive about their work. Consequently, there is little dialogue between the two and almost no attempt to learn from one another. The global dialog among police researchers and practitioners is limited. True, the literature on the police is growing exponentially, but its impact upon day-to-day policing is negligible. The aims and objectives of the IPES are to provide a forum to foster closer relationships among police researchers and practitioners on a global scale, to facilitate cross-cultural, international, and interdisciplinary exchanges for the enrichment of the law enforcement profession, to encourage discussion, and to publish research on challenging and contemporary problems facing the policing profession. One of the most important activities of the IPES is the organization of an annual meeting under the auspices of a police agency or an educational institution. Now in its 17th, year the annual meeting, a fiveday initiative on specific issues relevant to the policing profession, brings together ministers of interior and justice, police commissioners and chiefs, members of academia representing world-renown institutions, and many more criminal justice elite from over 60 countries""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

American democracy is facing a crisis as fraught as we've seen in decades. Donald Trump's presidency has raised the specter of authoritarian rule. Extreme polarization and the scorched-earth war between the parties drags on with no end in sight. At the heart of this dangerous moment is a paradox: It took a figure as uniquely menacing as Trump to rivet the nation's attention on the fragility of our democracy. Yet the causes of our dysfunction are long-running--they predate Trump, helped facilitate his rise, and, distressingly, will outlast his presidency. In An Uncivil War, Sargent sounds an urgent alarm about the deeper roots of our democratic backsliding--and how we can begin to turn things around. Drawing upon years of research and reporting, he exposes the unparalleled sophistication and ambition of GOP tactics, including computer-generated gerrymandering, underhanded voter suppression, and ever-escalating legislative hardball. We are also plagued by other brutal, seemingly intractable problems such as dismal turnout and powerful, built-in temptations to tilt the political playing field with unscrupulous partisan trickery. All of this has been accompanied by foreign-government intervention and an unprecedented level of political disinformation that threatens to undermine the very possibility of shared agreement on facts and poses profound new challenges to the media's ability to inform the citizenry. Yet the Republican Party is only part of the problem. As Sargent provocatively reveals, Democrats share culpability for helping to accelerate this slide. But our plight is far from hopeless. In an account that includes numerous interviews with political operatives and strategists in both parties, political scientists and historians, An Uncivil War proposes practical ways of shoring up our democracy--a series of guiding objective that large-D and small-d democrats alike must treat as eminently attainable. It is a handbook for restoring fair play to our politics at a moment when the stakes could not be higher""--Dust jacket.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Today's progressives now work for professional organizations more comfortable with the inside game in Washington, where they are outmatched and outspent by special interests. Labor unions now focus on the narrowest possible understanding of the interests of their members, and membership continues to decline in lockstep with the narrowing of their goals. Meanwhile, promising movements like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter have not accomplished meaningful change. Why do progressives in the United States keep losing on so many issues? In No Shortcuts, Jane McAlevey argues that progressives can win, but lack the organized power to enact significant change, to outlast their bosses in labor fights, and to hold elected leaders accountable. Drawing upon her experience as a scholar and longtime organizer in the student, environmental, and labor movements, McAlevey examines the case studies of recent social movements to pinpoint the factors that helped them succeed - or fail - to accomplish their intended goals. McAlevey makes a compelling case that the great social movements of previous eras gained their power from mass organizing, a strategy today's progressive have mostly abandoned in favor of mobilization or advocacy. She ultimately concludes that, in order to win, progressive movements must adopt bottom-up organizing strategies that place the power for change in the hands of workers and activists at the community level. Beyond the concrete examples in this book, McAlevey's arguments have direct implications for anyone involved in organizing for social change. Much more than just a cogent analysis, No Shortcuts explains exactly how progressives can go about rebuilding powerful movements at work, in our communities, and at the ballot box.""--  ""An examination of strategies for effective organizing""--   Read more Read less",8 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Puerto Rico under Colonial Rule: Political Persecution and the Quest for Human Rights,Ramón Bosque-Pérez,political_science,First published in 2005,/works/OL15232448W,/authors/OL7232213A/Ramón_Bosque-Pérez,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24327660M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 30, 2005|Publisher  State University of New York Press|Language English|Pages 256","Essays on human rights in Puerto Rico during the twentieth century.  Puerto Rico, one of the last and most populated colonial territories in the world, occupies a relatively unique position. Its lengthy interaction with the United States has resulted in the long-term acquisition of expanded legal rights and relative political stability. At the same time, that interaction has simultaneously seen political intolerance and the denial of basic rights, particularly toward those who have challenged colonialism. In Puerto Rico under Colonial Rule, academics and intellectuals from the fields of political science, history, sociology, and law examine three themes: evidence of state-sponsored political persecution in the twentieth century, contemporary issues, and the case of Vieques.  “…a true and seldom explored history of how the voices of decolonization in Puerto Rico were silenced by agencies of the United States and Puerto Rico through often illegal means. It is a history the American public is not aware of, but should know.” — from the Foreword by Congressman José E. Serrano  “This book offers a thorough and current discussion—the best available in English—of the twentieth-century history of political persecution and human rights in Puerto Rico.” — Andrés Torres, coeditor of The Puerto Rican Movement: Voices from the Diaspora  “The extent of official United States repression of the independence movement in Puerto Rico is not widely known or acknowledged. The editors and contributors do a good job of bringing the most salient facts of this black page of United States governmental policy and practice to light.” — Gerald Meyer, coeditor of The Lost World of Italian-American Radicalism: Politics, Labor, and Culture  Contributors include Ivonne Acosta-Lespier, César J.

What's more, the crazies seem to be gaining the upper hand. Rational thought cannot prevail in the current social and media environment, where elections are won by appealing to voters' hearts rather than their minds. The rapid-fire pace of modern politics, the hypnotic repetition of daily news items and even the multitude of visual sources of information all make it difficult for the voice of reason to be heard. In Enlightenment 2.0, bestselling author Joseph Heath outlines a program for a second Enlightenment. The answer, he argues, lies in a new ""slow politics."" It takes as its point of departure recent psychological and philosophical research, which identifies quite clearly the social and environmental preconditions for the exercise of rational thought. It is impossible to restore sanity merely by being sane and trying to speak in a reasonable tone of voice. The only way to restore sanity is by engaging in collective action against the social conditions that have crowded it out.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The red/blue state divisions run so deep that it is possible to live without any interaction—ideological or otherwise—with those who hold different opinions than oneself. We are a people alienated, from ourselves and from our government.The authors, an odd mix across the Blue/Red divide—one a founder of the modern evangelical movement, the other a liberal Jewish former Clinton aide—hold an extended conversation across many months, several states, and two countries—sometimes contentious, sometimes funny, exploring the idea of how unlikely pairings—and thus, the entire country—can come together. They argue that we're entering a new era in history, and now is the time to rise up to it; to make ourselves able to tackle the enormous problems in our laps; to, in effect, move mountains.

Dieser sich über mehrere Jahre hinziehende Reformprozeß erscheint von besonderem Interesse. Erstens zeigt sein Ablauf grundsätzlich, wie polit-ökonomisch zu erklärende Interessenstrukturen der beteiligten Akteure und nicht etwa ökonomische Rationalität den Reformprozeß bestimmt haben. Zweitens ist das ökonomisch unbefriedigende Ergebnis die Ursache der erneuten Klagen der Länder Bayern, Hessen und Baden-Württemberg vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht. Drittens dürften die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit Antworten über den weiteren Verlauf der gegenwärtigen Reformbestrebungen des bundesstaatlichen Finanzausgleichs auf der politischen Ebene geben. Außerdem wird das Instrument der Sonder-Bundesergänzungszuweisungen zur Beseitigung der Haushaltsnotlage in Bremen und im Saarland einer theoretischen und empirischen Analyse unterzogen.

Engaging and thoroughly researched, this biography is the first in fifty years to examine the life of this inspiring Australian.This is the story of how an easy-going Sydney politician, with a reputation for enjoying the pleasures of the table and a fondness for cricket, became possessed by one enduring enthusiasm. That passion, maintained across almost two decades, was to make a new country from a collection of British colonies.How did Edmund Barton, although only one of many who contributed to the federal cause, come to be regarded as its actual and symbolic leader? In the company of figures like Henry Parkes, Samuel Griffith, George Reid and Alfred Deakin, Barton was by no measure the most flamboyant or forceful of these campaigners. So what led the supporters of Federation to acknowledge the man caricatured in the press as 'Tosspot Toby' as the necessary man, 'the one man for the job' of the first prime minister of the Commonwealth of Australia?Starting as a struggling young Sydney lawyer, blooded in the turbulent politics of colonial New South Wales, Barton came to understand that Federation mattered. This genial gentleman from clubland embarked on a personal crusade: he found common ground between strident colonial rivals, steered a draft constitution through two fractious conventions, travelled thousands of kilometres to convince open-air audiences, confronted interfering London 'statesmen', risked bankruptcy, and negotiated the necessary compromises to create a new political entity. Without Barton's talents Australia might not have become a commonwealth in 1901.Few Australians can recall the name of their first prime minister, fewer know what kind of man he was. This, the first biography in fifty years, demonstrates that Edmund Barton was and is worth knowing.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet, people take actions not because of statistical data on inequalities, of which they might not be aware, but because of injustices they perceive. This volume analyses the results of original surveys with over 3,000 respondents in African cities and towns, exposing clear discrepancies between objective inequalities and people's subjective perceptions. The contributors examine experiences in country pairs and probe into the reasons why neighbouring countries, sharing common historical traits, sometimes took contrasting pathways of peace and violent conflict. Combining quantitative analysis and qualitative anatomy of historical experiences of conflict and reconciliation in Rwanda, Burundi, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Nigeria, the study brings forward a set of policy recommendations for development practitioners. This work further addresses the issue of institutional choice and reveals how sustainable power-sharing and decentralisation contribute to political stability in Africa""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A central theme is the relationship between popular images of France flowing from its cultural, culinary, and linguistic influence, its appeal as a tourist destination, and the influence of its republican and revolutionary heritage, and the often contradictory realities of French society facing up to globalization, Europeanization and the other challenges of the 21st century. The book deals with the issue of whether or not France has come to terms with its tumultous past, its wars, civil strife and rapid modernization following the devastation of World War II.  It also examines key aspects of French political culture and looks at how the core republican principles of libery, equality and fraternity are being interpreted and implemented today.

It explores how political and social hierarchies operate within parliaments through ceremonial spectacles, formal and informal rules and rituals, art and architecture.  Members are socialized through everyday practices but such institutional disciplining is also challenged performatively - by refusal to participate, by subversion of norms or by rejection of rules. The contributions to this volume highlight that the everyday ritual practices as well as institutional ceremonies have significant political meaning, whether their focus is upon the spectacular or the quotidian. Chapters on opening ceremony, Prime Minister's Questions, on performance of debate and disruption, on the architecture and space of suggest that what has often been seen as the banal backdrop to politics proper, accumulated tradition or necessary rules of procedure, should in fact be the starting-point for our analyses of modern democratic parliaments""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Strauss was for many decades the quintessential Democratic power broker. Born to a poor Jewish family in West Texas, he founded the law firm that became Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, and-while forever changing the nature of the Washington law firm-worked as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, special trade representative, ambassador to the Soviet Union and then Russia, and an advisor to presidents. As former first lady Barbara Bush wrote of Strauss in her memoir: He is absolutely the most amazing politician. He is everybody's friend and, if he chooses, could sell you the paper off your own wall."" But it isn't the positions Strauss held that make his story fascinating; it is what he represented about the culture of Washington in his day. He was a master of the art of knowing everyone who mattered and getting things done. Based on exclusive access to Strauss, The Whole Damn Deal brings to life a vanished epoch of working behind the scenes, political deal making, and successful bipartisanship in Washington""--  ""Robert S. Strauss was for many decades, the quintessential political operator. He played a pivotal role in US politics for more than fifty years, serving as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, US Trade Representative, and US Ambassador to the USSR and later Russia. He has advised and represented many US presidents for both major political parties. Yet, we know very little of this man who has been so influential behind the scenes. This is the story of how Bobby Strauss, a poor, Jewish boy from West Texas, became Robert S. Strauss, a lawyer and politician of national and international renown. Strauss entered national politics when Beltway outsiders were planning their takeover of the Democratic Party in the aftermath of the divisive 1968 Chicago convention. After the 1972 nomination and subsequent defeat of George McGovern polarized the old and new factions of the Democratic Party, Strauss became chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He managed to create a coalition of old guard conservatives, minorities, youth, and representatives of both labor and big business that resembled the patchwork Democratic Party we still have to this day. Strauss excelled at balancing accommodation and persuasion. He was proud to be an insider and a politician, even when those were considered dirty words, because he enjoyed the negotiations that politics then entailed. His Texas charm and political savvy won over both sides of the aisle in Washington. This book will describe what went on in the smoke-filled rooms, and in the bathrooms of the hotel suites, ""where the real decisions were made,"" as Strauss likes to say. It is a vivid portrait of a bygone era of civilized Washington politics, when Republicans and Democrats worked together without fear of criticism.

A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF THE POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION PROCESSES OF NURSES IN SPECIALIZED ROLES IN THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS,Camille Therese Barry,political_science,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265511W,/authors/OL5357698A/Camille_Therese_Barry,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 157,"This descriptive study aimed to describe the political socialization processes of nurses who had attained specialized roles in public policy development and implementation in federal and state governments. A purposive sample of 33 nurses in specialized roles in public policy development and implementation in federal and state governments was studied. Primary data were collected via a structured interview schedule with fixed alternative and open-ended questions developed by the investigator and based on Greenstein's (1968) work. Data collection was accomplished by face-to-face and telephone interviews conducted from November 1987 through January 1988.  The conclusions of the study included the following: (1) Nurses who had been socialized to specialized roles in public policy development and implementation were not typical of employed nurses in general; (2) Nurses who are activists in the political arena typically were not socialized through formal nursing education; (3) Although not directly socialized through formal nursing education, some nurses in specialized political roles gained certain skills and knowledge through their formal nursing education that were transferrable to the political arena; (4) Organized nursing has the potential to prepare nurses to assume specialized political roles; and (5) Nurses who have been socialized to the political process believe that future nurse activists should be socialized through formal educational experiences.  The conclusions of the study indicate a need to conduct further studies of factors influencing political socialization. Barriers to a political career choice and to the political career development of nurses also require further study, as do explanations for the lack of nurses in politically responsible positions. Most importantly, strategies for eliminating barriers to a political career choice and to the political career development process of nurses need to be developed and addressed through nurses' formal education. Also warranting investigators' attention are nursing curriculum changes that would enhance nurses' participation in the political process as well as the effects of those changes on the political behavior of nurses.

"SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN POLITICAL EXPECTATIONS AND PARTICIPATION AMONG NURSES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE, EDUCATION, AND ADMINISTRATION",Priscilla Neeley Daffin,political_science,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265244W,/authors/OL5357460A/Priscilla_Neeley_Daffin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 97,"In all areas of practice, nurses have been challenged to assume a politically active role in governmental politics. However, little research has been conducted concerning nurses' political expectations and participation. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine the similarities and differences in political expectations and participation among registered nurses in Alabama who were employed in clinical practice, education, and administration.  A 54-item instrument, the political expectations and participation questionnaire, developed by the investigator, measured nurses' reported political expectations and participation. Subcategories of items were related to nine roles associated with politically active nurses (PAN): voter, campaigner, player, monitor, networker, spokesperson, negotiator, leader, and lobbyist.  A total of 190 or 42% of a 450 stratified random sample represented three groups of nurses including 97 from clinical practice, 56 from education, and 37 from administration. Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (p =.05) and the Scheffe post hoc test were calculated for data analysis. The sample of 186 females and 6 males ranged in age from 22 to 65. Analysis indicated that 91% of the subjects had expectations that nurses should be engaged in the nine roles associated with PAN while only 26% reported participation in the roles. There was no difference in political expectations among the three nursing groups for eight roles; however, for the role of monitor, there was a difference between expectations of the clinical practice and administration groups. Political participation of nurses in clinical practice was different from that of nurses in both educations and administration for eight roles; however, for the role of leader, participation of nurses in clinical practice was different from that of nurses in administration.  One conclusion was that although nurses have high political expectations, most nurses are politically active primarily as voters. Future research is needed to determine specific strategies which promote nurses' participation in the nine roles associated with PAN.

NATIONAL SURVEY OF CERTIFIED NURSE-MIDWIVES: PERCEIVED POSITION IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND POTENTIAL FOR MOBILIZATION,Penelope Sue Cass,political_science,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264379W,/authors/OL5356679A/Penelope_Sue_Cass,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 164,"Recognizing American nurse-midwives' underutilization, this study examined certified nurse-midwives' perceptions of their position in the health care system and their potential for political mobilization. Nurse-midwives were conceptualized as an oppressed group whose degree of integration into the traditional medical system (marginality), feelings about their present position (social consciousness), and perceptions about various political issues and actions may influence their ability to mobilize and participate politically (participation decision).  Marginality was operationalized as subjects' opinions about how similar or dissimilar they were from other health care providers in general, in terms of their values and attributes related to practice, and by assessing selected psychological traits. Social consciousness was operationalized by measuring nurse-midwives' sense of group identity and awareness, tendencies toward self or system blame, and their belief in self-determination. Political participation was measured using self-reports of past political participation and subjects' responses to a ""situation inventory"" of hypothetical political situations.  The subjects were 1235 certified nurse-midwives from the American College of Nurse-Midwives lifelong and active membership lists (66% return rate). Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of 130 items, developed for this study. The instrument measured marginality, social consciousness, perceptions of act effectiveness in the past and present, political participation decisions, and selected demographics. Reliability was assessed by examining the internal consistency of multiple measures. Content validity was established by expert review and critique. Construct validity was determined using factor analysis. Predictive validity was established by path analysis.  Results suggested that nurse-midwives perceived themselves as different from other health care providers, were socially conscious, politically active, preferred particular strategies, and were concerned about specific issues. Path analysis of thirteen variables predicted 49.7% of nurse-midwives' political participation decisions. Perceived effectiveness of selected political actions in the past and present, and belief in change as necessary were the most important predictors of participation.  Implications for nurse-midwifery education include incorporation of content enhancing the direct and vicarious political experiences of students. In practice, nurse-midwives should focus their mobilization efforts on preferred issues and strategies. Finally, other groups could adapt this study to enhance their own mobilization efforts.

"AN EVALUATION OF THE 1987 TEXAS SENATE BILL 1160: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATED ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR NURSES (ACCOUNTABILITY, PEER REVIEW)",Alexia Elise Green,political_science,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267853W,/authors/OL5359690A/Alexia_Elise_Green,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 212,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Senate Bill 1160 in promoting accountability for professional nursing practice within the State of Texas. Mandatory reporting and peer review were examined as mechanisms to promote accountability. This study utilized a nonexperimental, explanatory evaluation research design. Data sources included record abstracts, interviews and responses to a questionnaire. Data analysis included the use of descriptive and inferential statistics.  Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded that professional nursing accountability was enhanced via the use of mandatory reporting and peer review as mandated by Senate Bill 1160. However, proportionally speaking in relation to the total RN population, under reporting of incompetent nurses was probably occurring. It was also concluded, that peer review was primarily being utilized as a reactive process and not in a proactive manner aimed at improving the overall quality of professional nursing practice.

AN ANALYSIS OF LOBBYING STRATEGIES USED TO INFLUENCE HEALTH POLICY,Jessica Halstead Sharp,political_science,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279216W,/authors/OL5368497A/Jessica_Halstead_Sharp,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 225,"This descriptive study identifies and analyzes lobbying strategies used by lobbyists hired by special interest groups to influence health policy in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Two health care pieces of legislation from the 1991 legislative session were analyzed: Independence Practice of Physical Therapists and Prescriptive Authority for Licensed Nurse Practitioners. Data were collected from three sources: (a) a researcher designed questionnaire; (b) a semi-structured interview; and (c) content analysis of PAC donation records and membership lists. A sample representative of the health policy milieu of the Commonwealth of Virginia included three lobbyists and two co-sponsors for the nurse practitioner legislation and two lobbyists and one sponsor for the physical therapists. Each lobbyist and sponsor completed a questionnaire and participated in an interview. Analysis included non-parametric statistical analyses of the questionnaire data, theme identification from the interviews, and corroboration of the documents with the questionnaires and interviews.  Lobbying strategies considered ""most effective"" by lobbyists and sponsors were ""contact by visit"" and ""receiving research results or technical information."" Lobbying strategies described as effective ranged in frequency from ""often"" to ""sometimes"" included: (1) contact by phone particularly from constituents; (2) contact with lobbyists; (3) help draft legislation; (4) inform members of the organization about activities as a lobbyist; and (5) hear testimony at committee and subcommittee meetings. The examination of the interview portion of the study resulted in the identification of the environmental themes. The themes of sponsorship, timing, events, and ethics influenced the nurse practitioner legislation. The physical therapists' legislation was influenced by sponsorship, events, and ethics. It is important to note that the theme of time was absent in the unsuccessful physical therapy legislation but appears in the nurse practitioner legislation which passed. The presence, amount, and quality of environmental themes influenced the passage of health care legislation. Content analyses of PAC donations and membership records supported the results from the questionnaires and the interviews.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is a journey through contemporary political philosophy that puts forward a basic interpretative hypothesis. Mariano Croce and Andrea Salvatore analyse the theories and proposals of many prominent political philosophers and attempt to arrive at the conclusion that today's politics is characterised by a striking reviviscence of groups (whether ethnic, religious, financial, or else) which is profoundly impacting on the role of traditional political institutions, and on the state in particular. Political philosophers discussed include Giorgio Agamben, Zygmunt Bauman, Mark Goodale, Martha Nussbaum, Charles Taylor, Slavoj Žižek and many others. Undoing Ties also devotes attention to elements that are crucial to a sound analysis of contemporary politics, both at a national and at a global level, such as the law and the transformation of the legal practice and a socio-anthropological analysis of globalisation. It is an exhaustive picture of the debates and discussions in the field of political philosophy in a captivating way, which leads the reader to an informed global understanding of the field, but also to reflect on some vital issues that directly affect their everyday life""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Collectively, the essays assert hip hop's importance as an ""organic globalizer:"" no matter its pervasiveness or reach around the world, hip-hop ultimately remains a grassroots phenomenon that is born of the community from which it permeates. Hip hop, then, holds promise through three separate but related avenues: (1) through cultural awareness and identification/recognition of voices of marginalized communities through music and art; (2) through social creation and the institutionalization of independent alternative institutions and non-profit organizations in civil society geared toward social and economic justice; and (3) through political activism and participation in which demands are articulated and made on the state. With editorial bridges between chapters and an emphasis on interdisciplinary and diverse perspectives, The Organic Globalizer is the natural scholarly evolution in the conversation about hip-hop and politics""--  Contains primary sources.

Largely, the administration of elections, the technologies used in the process, and the general procedures used were typically of concern only to election officials, candidates running for office and those managing their races, and a very few academics. This volume begins to fill that vacuum by bringing together in one book a number of essays that citizens, academics, election officials, policy makers, and other stakeholders can read to become better informed about procedures that used today to audit elections and election administration, and to learn more about new approaches to improve existing election audit procedures.  ""--  ""Since the 2000 election, American politics has been obsessed with the question of fraud in, and accuracy, of election results. The 36 days of controversy in Florida in the 2000 election - with changing results, ballot problems, ballot counting discrepancies, and the issues with the chain of custody of ballots - illustrated to the public the challenges that can occur in elections. This book shows how, by applying simple concepts used in auditing, elections in the U.S. and internationally can be made more transparent, more accurate, and better managed. The techniques are presented in easy to understand chapters that can be applied in elections today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The promise of Jacques Delors seems to have spawned a flurry of European Union directives, yet has since fizzled out. This edited volume, bringing together a team of international interdisciplinary experts from across Europe, systematically explores the EU's social policy activities, both before and after the Eurocrisis. The contributors examine how and why the great expectations remained unfulfilled, but also move the scholarly debate beyond the emphasis on courts and markets. European Commission policy entrepreneurship, eastern enlargement, the shifting ideological contours of European Social Democracy, and the spirit of the Lisbon Agenda have all led to market creation taking strong precedence over market correcting policies.

The phrase ""that's classified"" is increasingly used not to protect national secrets from legitimate enemies, but rather to stifle public discourse regarding national security. Washington today is inclined to see secrecy as a convenient cure to many of its problems. But too often these problems are not challenges to national security, they involve the embarrassment of political figures, disclosure of mismanagement, incompetence and corruption and even outright criminality. For national security issues to figure in democratic deliberation, the public must have access to basic facts that underlie the issues. The more those facts disappear under a cloak of state secrecy, the less space remains for democratic process and the more deliberation falls into the hands of largely unelected national security elites. The way out requires us to think much more critically and systematically about secrecy and its role in a democratic state""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Iran and Libya are well known as sponsors of terrorism, while other countries, some with strong connections to the west, have enabled terrorist activity by turning a blind eye. Daniel Byman's hard-hitting and articulate book is the first to analyse this phenomenon. Focusing primarily on sponsors from the Middle East and South Asia, it examines the different types of support that states provide, their motivations, and the impact of such sponsorship. The book also considers regimes that allow terrorists to raise money and recruit without providing active support. The experiences of Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Libya are detailed here, alongside the histories of radical groups such as al-Qaida, Hizbullah and Hamas. In conclusion, the book assesses the difficulties of forcing sponsors to cut ties with terrorist groups.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Many studies have shown that public institutions are an important (some would argue the most important) determinant of long-run rates of economic growth. This book argues that to understand the difficulties and pitfalls of state building in the contemporary world, it is necessary to analyze previous efforts to create institutional capacity in conflictive contexts. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the process of state and nation building in Latin America and Spain from independence to the 1930s. The book examines how Latin American countries and Spain tried to build modern and efficient state institutions for more than a century - without much success. The chapters discuss key processes and challenges of state building. To what extent do historical legacies determine the capacity and reach of states? What are the obstacles to and paths toward the effective consolidation of public authority? How can states best design and create the institutions meant to provide the basic services now associated with citizenship? How can we put together notions of community that include diverse groups and cultures within a single identity, while also respecting the integrity of particular traditions? The Spanish and Latin American experience of the nineteenth century was arguably the first regional stage on which the organizational and political dilemmas that still haunt states were faced. This book provides an unprecedented perspective on the development and contemporary outcome of those state and nation building projects""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book examines four important traditions within the history of modern political philosophy and delves into how each of them addresses the problem of religion. Two of these traditions pursue projects of domesticating religion. The civil religion tradition, principally defined by Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, seeks to domesticate religion by putting it solidly in the service of politics. The liberal tradition pursues an alternative strategy of domestication by seeking to put as much distance as possible between religion and politics. Modern theocracy is a militant reaction against liberalism, and it reverses the relationship of subordination asserted by civil religion: it puts politics directly in the service of religion. Finally, a fourth tradition is defined by Nietzsche and Heidegger. Aspects of their thought are not just modern, but hyper-modern, yet they manifest an often-hysterical reaction against liberalism that is fundamentally shared with the theocratic tradition. Together, these four traditions compose a vital dialogue that carries us to the heart of political philosophy itself""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die Ursache dieser Spannungen sind tief verwurzelte Traditionen und Denkschulen der einzelnen Mitgliedsländer. Untersucht wird, inwieweit die britische Wirtschaftsordnung mit der bis heute realisierten Wirtschaftsordnung der EU übereinstimmt. Hierzu wird herausgearbeitet, welche länderspezifischen Merkmale für die britische Europapolitik seit Beginn des europäischen Integrationsprozesses bedeutsam waren. Gleichzeitig wird analysiert, in welchem Umfang sich die drei im Untersuchungszeitraum gültigen Ordnungskonzeptionen auf die britische Europapolitik ausgewirkt haben. Es zeigt sich, dass der klassische Liberalismus als das grundlegende Gestaltungsprinzip angesehen werden kann. Durch das Leitbild des klassischen Liberalismus stimmt der britische Ordnungsentwurf grundsätzlich mit dem europäischen Ordnungsentwurf marktwirtschaftlicher Prägung überein.

Nevertheless elites have remained the known unknowns of the European integration process. The present volume is designed to change this. Based on surveys of political and economic elites in 18 European countries, it is a comprehensive study of the visions, fears, cognitions, and values of members of national parliaments and top business leaders underlying their attitudes towards European integration. It also investigates political and economic elites’ embeddedness in transnational networks and their ability to communicate in multicultural settings. Our book strongly supports the view of an elitist character of the process of European integration on the one hand, while challenging the idea that European national elites have merged or are even merging into a coherent Eurelite on the other. As the 11 chapters of this book show, the process of European integration is much more colourful and even contradictory than concepts of a straightforward normative and structural integration suggest. In particular this process is deeply rooted in and conditional on the social and political settings in national contexts. The empirical basis for this book is provided by the data of the international IntUne project, which has for the first time created a comprehensive database combining coordinated surveys of Europe-related attitudes at the elite and general population level.

Die Entwicklung der franzoesischen Wettbewerbspolitik bis zur Verordnung Nr. 86-1243 vom 01.

Anhand einer exemplarischen Untersuchung der Erfassung der Behinderungsstrategie wird nachgewiesen, dass ein solches Urteil mittlerweile verfehlt ist. In einer Neuinterpretation der französischen Wettbewerbspolitik wird gezeigt, in welcher Form eine Kopplung von Rechtsnormen, Institutionen und Verfahren erfolgen muss, damit eine effiziente Wettbewerbspolitik betrieben werden kann.

Exchange Rate Policy for MERCOSUR : - Lessons from the European Union,Silvia Marengo,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500415W,/authors/OL8908810A/Silvia_Marengo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 246,"In January 1995, four Latin American countries, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay joined their destinies within a common and ambitious enterprise called MERCOSUR. MERCOSUR, the Common Market of the South, represents an important economic integration area that generates a GDP of $US 600 billion, providing a market of 200 million people spread over an area of 12 million square km. Initially, MERCOSUR performance has been more than successful, as intra-MERCOSUR trade has increased significantly. However, the elimination of intra-MERCOSUR tariffs will not be efficient if at the same time the sharp variability of nominal exchange rates artificially affects the relative prices of different products. The question as to the choice of the optimal exchange rate system to be adopted among MERCOSUR countries becomes critical if MERCOSUR states attempt to go further along the path of increasing their trade flows of goods and services. The study contributes to filling this gap by providing some alternative answers to this issue. The analysis has been based on three pillars: a theoretical review of exchange rate systems; a review of the European experience; and an analysis of the Latin American experience.

Diese Bestandsaufnahme der Entwicklung vom Antiautoritarismus der „68er-Bewegung“ sowie undogmatischer oppositioneller Bestrebungen in der der DDR geht dieser Frage nach. Dabei stellen die Autoren fest, dass die historische Rolle des Neoanarchismus bei der Modernisierung der hiesigen gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse und Beziehungen gemeinhin unterschätzt wird. Antiautoritäre Jugendbewegung, Außerparlamentarische Opposition (68er), Neue Soziale Bewegungen, Grüne Parteigründungen bis hin zur ökonomischen Entschlackung bürokratischer Prozesse und flachen Hierarchien in Unternehmen – vermittelt über diese Entwicklungslinie ─ sind im Verlauf der vergangenen fünf Jahrzehnte Motive der Subkultur, des Marxismus, der Kritischen Theorie und eben auch des Neoanarchismus aufgegriffen, herrschaftskonform zugerichtet und ins Establishment integriert worden. Ohne Frage ist die Gesellschaft darüber auch ein Stück demokratischer und offener geworden.  Jedoch scheint das Projekt des emanzipatorischen Fortschritts mittlerweile festzustecken. Kulturpessimismus grassiert angesichts der Wiederkehr rückwärts gewandter religiöser Vorstellungen und ihrer Rückwirkung auf das gesellschaftliche Miteinander sowie neuer, sozial „angepasster Formen des Rechtsextremismus und Antisemitismus. Globalisierungseffekte, Cyberüberwachungswahn, Optimierungszwang in sämtlichen Lebensbereichen, die näher rückende Endlichkeit natürlicher Ressourcen, Klimawandel usw. tun ihr Übriges.

From Ellis Island to the Supreme Court in just two generations, Jay Sekulow is on a mission to defend the American right to individual freedom--and he will protect it from any threat, even if that includes our current administration. According to Jay, the warning signs were there before Obama was elected. This new and unprecedented attack on individual liberties became clear as soon as Obama came to power. The administration's focus on increasing the power of the government, decreasing individual autonomy, and suppressing dissent goes against all of the fundamental liberties outlined in the Constitution. As our government cracks down on leaks in their own operations and supports intrusions into individual privacy, personal freedom is lost. But Jay has a plan to fight back. With insights into Jay's legal strategies, Power Trip focuses on successful responses to previous Obama Administration overreach and acts as a guide to help Americans continue on this path. Jay shines a light on many abuses Americans are unaware of, and teaches us how to respond in effective ways, providing a roadmap for future victories. A welcome voice to conservative ears, Sekulow's point of view wholeheartedly supports those fighting to uphold personal liberties regardless of the administration in charge""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Even many of those critical of the inequalities of Indian society underwrite such claims. The Indian Ideology suggests that the roots of the current ills of the Republic go much deeper, historically. They lie, in the way the struggle for independence culminated in the transfer of power from British rule to Congress in a divided subcontinent, not least in the roles played by Gandhi as the great architect of the movement, and Nehru as his appointed successor, in the catastrophe of Partition. Only an honest reckoning with that disaster, Perry Anderson argues, offers an understanding of what has gone wrong with the Republic since Independence""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whilst some of these claims may be exaggerated, Sudan was indeed unique in the region at the time in that it witnessed not one but two popular uprisings which successfully uprooted military authoritarianisms.  Civil Uprisings in Modern Sudan provides the first scholarly book-length history of the 1964 and 1985 uprisings. It explores the uprisings themselves, their legacy and the contemporary relevance they hold in the context of the current political climate of the Middle East.

"Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning (Cities and Regions: Planning, Policy and Management)",Vanessa Watson,political_science,First published in 2002,/works/OL224851W?edition=ia%3Achangecontinuity00wats,/authors/OL2492103A/Vanessa_Watson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7489383M-M.jpg,"Publish Date March 1, 2002|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 192","Change and Continuity in Spatial Planning addresses a question of enduring interest to planners: can planning really bring about significant and positive change? In South Africa the process of political transition appeared to create the preconditions for planners to demonstrate how their traditional humanitarian and environmental concerns could find concrete expression in the reshaping of the built environment. The requirement that the segregrated apartheid cities be restructured, reintegrated and made accessible to the poor was high on the agenda of the new post-apartheid government, even prior to their election. The story of how planners in the metropolitan area of Cape Town attempted over the last decade to address this agenda, is the subject of this book. Integral to this story is how planning practices were shaped by the past, in a rapidly changing context characterised by a globalising economy, new systems of governance, a changing political ideology, and a culture of intensifying poverty and diversity.More broadly the book addresses the issue of how planners use power, in situations which themselves represent networks of power relations, where both planners and those they engage with operate through frames of reference fundamentally shaped by place and history.

It suggests that liberal thought is intrinsically different from conservative thought, and that each constitutes a self-subsistent world-view with its specific qualities and rules. The book offers a set of guidelines to predict a person's views based on other views s/he holds, given that each world-view is what it is for structural reasons, and is more than merely a sum of discrete positions. It explains, for example, why people who support gay marriage also typically support the woman's right to an early-term abortion, and why people who demand that citizens ""support the military"" understand this as meaning, support putting members of the military in harm's way. Because liberal thought and conservative thought each constitutes a closed world-view, neither side will ever convince the other in an argument.

Efforts like these will be essential as climate change disrupts both weather patterns and the models on which we base our infrastructure. We will be forced to adapt.

"Surveillance, Privacy and Security",Michael Friedewald,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL20927051W,/authors/OL7334348A/Michael_Friedewald,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English,"This volume examines the relationship between privacy, surveillance and security, and the alleged privacy?security trade-off, focusing on the citizen?s perspective.        Recent revelations of mass surveillance programmes clearly demonstrate the ever-increasing capabilities of surveillance technologies. The lack of serious reactions to these activities shows that the political will to implement them appears to be an unbroken trend. The resulting move into a surveillance society is, however, contested for many reasons. Are the resulting infringements of privacy and other human rights compatible with democratic societies? Is security necessarily depending on surveillance? Are there alternative ways to frame security? Is it possible to gain in security by giving up civil liberties, or is it even necessary to do so, and do citizens adopt this trade-off? This volume contributes to a better and deeper understanding of the relation between privacy, surveillance and security, comprising in-depth investigations and studies of the common narrative that more security can only come at the expense of sacrifice of privacy. The book combines theoretical research with a wide range of empirical studies focusing on the citizen?s perspective. It presents empirical research exploring factors and criteria relevant for the assessment of surveillance technologies. The book also deals with the governance of surveillance technologies. New approaches and instruments for the regulation of security technologies and measures are presented, and recommendations for security policies in line with ethics and fundamental rights are discussed.        This book will be of much interest to students of surveillance studies, critical security studies, intelligence studies, EU politics and IR in general.

"EQUITY IN FINANCING AND ACCESS TO LONG TERM CARE (MEDICAID, NURSING HOMES)",Richard William Hug,political_science,First published in 1984,/works/OL12261871W,/authors/OL5354406A/Richard_William_Hug,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1984|Pages 333,"This study addresses, in two parts, a series of equity issues related to the financing and provision of long term care (LTC), particularly nursing home care. The first part consists of a review of equity concepts, ""theories"", and analysis techniques; background information on LTC; and a sketch of the major equity issues. The second part features three empirical exercises focusing on access to nursing homes, targeting of Medicaid LTC resources, and the interjurisdictional distribution of Medicaid LTC financing burdens. The access study uses logit analysis techniques on a specially constructed, nationally representative data set comprised of more than 45,000 observations on persons over age 65, including more than 1900 nursing homes residents. The principal finding of the access study is that among persons with one or more impairments in their Activities of Daily Living (ADL), whites are three times as likely to receive nursing home care as similarly-impaired non-whites (controlling for age, sex, and marital status). The study of Medicaid targeting of LTC resources uses multiple regression techniques on Medicaid program data by state. The results indicate that it cannot be said that state Medicaid programs are ""shaped"" by the needs of the poor elderly. There appears to be no relation between the share of the Medicaid program devoted to LTC and the relative size of the poor elderly population. The study also suggests that nursing home capacity and reimbursement levels are more important ""shapers"" of Medicaid programs than eligibility and benefit provisions. The study of the interjurisdictional distribution of Medicaid LTC financing burdens uses fiscal incidence analysis techniques on Medicaid program data for 1980. The study concludes that the Northeast region and the poor states. The price difference generated by the Medicaid formula is not great enough to induce the poor states to produce LTC services at the levels provided by the wealthy states.

Socratic puzzles,Robert Nozick,political_science,First published in 1997,/works/OL3336948W,/authors/OL540855A/Robert_Nozick,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1000327M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Harvard University Press|Language English|Pages 400,"One of the foremost philosophers of our time, Robert Nozick continues the Socratic tradition of investigation. This volume, which illustrates the originality, force, and scope of his work, also displays Nozick's trademark blending of extraordinary analytical rigor with intellectual playfulness. As such, Socratic Puzzles testifies to the great pleasure that both doing and reading philosophy can be.  Comprising essays and philosophical fictions, classics and new work, the book ranges from Socrates to W. V. Quine, from the implications of an Israeli kibbutz to the flawed arguments of Ayn Rand. Nozick considers the figure of Socrates himself as well as the Socratic method (why is it a ""method"" of getting at the truth?). Many of these essays bring classic methods to bear on new questions about choice. How should you choose in a disconcerting situation (""Newcomb's Problem"") when your decisions are completely predictable? Why do threats and not offers typically coerce our choices? How do we make moral judgments when we realize that our moral principles have exceptions? Other essays present new approaches to familiar intellectual puzzles, from the stress on simplicity in scientific hypotheses to the tendency of intellectuals to oppose capitalism.  As up to date as the latest reflections on animal rights; as perennial as the essentials of aesthetic merit (doggerel by Isaac Newton goes to prove that changing our view of the world won't suffice); as whimsical as a look at how some philosophical problems might appear from God's point of view: these essays attest to the timeliness and timelessness of Nozick's thinking. With a personal introduction, in which Nozick discusses the origins, tools, and themes of his work, Socratic Puzzles demonstrates how philosophy can constitute a way of life.

In this wide-ranging interview Skybreak, a scientist with professional training in ecology and evolutionary biology, and an advocate of the new synthesis of communism brought forward by Bob Avakian, speaks to why science and the scientific method are essential not only in relationship to the natural world but also to understanding society and transforming it in the interests of humanity.  Skybreak is the author of, among other works, The Science of Evolution and the Myth of Creationism: Knowing What’s Real and Why It Matters,and Of Primeval Steps andFuture Leaps: An Essay on the Emergence of Human Beings,the Source of Women’s Oppression,and the Road to Emancipation.

The latest generation of titles in this series also feature glossaries and visual elements that complement the classic, familiar format.   In CliffsNotes on The Prince, you explore the Italian Renaissance in Florence   in the late 1400s and early 1500s, during which Machiavelli was a statesman who took a special interest in observing the distinct intelligence that made certain rulers successful. In a nutshell, The Prince is an analysis of how to acquire and maintain political power. It remains one of the definitive statements of power and control and is based on what Machiavelli saw, not what he felt or imagined.   This study guide carefully walks you through The Prince by providing summaries and critical analyses of each chapter of the book. You'll also explore the life and background of the author. Other features that help you study include    A list of people the book explores  Glossaries in each chapter to define new terms  Critical essays about topics like the vilification of Machiavelli and free will  A review section that tests your knowledge  A Resource  Center  with books, magazine articles, and Web sites for more study     Classic literature or modern modern-day treasure -- you'll understand it all with expert information and insight from CliffsNotes study guides.

Through a powerful speech and the events preceding and following it, they show us how they grappled with conflicting values, varying demands, and the uncertainties of trying to forge a good society. This book is aimed at practicing leaders--and students of leadership""--  ""Americans hunger for statesmanship. They seek leaders who will respond to problems by putting the nation's long-term needs ahead of partisanship and personal gain. We have faced this need before, and leaders came forward with acts of statesmanship. We can learn from them. Statesmanship, Character and Leadership in America explores what seven leaders at turning points in American history said and did. Their character and ability to manage the context of their times, craft a transcendent purpose, practice artful politics, exercise compelling persuasion and call forth high moral values from the American people offer ideas and techniques for leaders today""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Indeed, RAND as the quintessential Cold War think tank provides a fruitful illustration of the difficult adaptation of American strategic studies in the last two decades. ""--  ""1991, the Cold War is over. What happens then to the intellectuals who spent their life working and writing about the bipolar confrontation? This book is born out of this very question. Looking at one of the most emblematic American think tank in recent history, the RAND Corporation, it provides key insights on the evolution of strategic studies in the U.S. in the last two decades. Based on numerous interviews and exclusive archives, the research delivers a detailed analysis of RAND's intellectual and corporate development. But beyond this specific case study, the book is more than a historical portray of a American research center. Through RAND and its relationship with the American Military, it aims at understanding the rules of the ""field"" of strategic studies in the United States. Moreover this work allows the readers to better apprehend the way the elements driving the U.S. defense policies since 1989--the political uncertainty and its doctrinal consequences--shaped the major international events in the last two decades""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Beginning with the American Revolution, through the Civil War, and World War II, the ability for deployed military personnel to cast a ballot in elections was difficult and often vociferously resisted by politicians of both political parties. Finally, during the Cold War, Congress managed to pass the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. That Act, along with further improvements in the early twenty-first century, began to make it easier for military personnel and American citizens living abroad to participate in elections at home. Using newly obtained data about the military voter, The Soldier Vote challenges some widely held views about the nature of the military vote and how service personnel vote""--  ""The Soldier Vote tells the story of how American citizens in the armed forces gained the right to vote while away from home""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Einen zweiten Schwerpunkt bildet die theoretische Analyse des Status quo. Wieso verausgabt der Staat in einem marktwirtschaftlichen System Milliarden für den Sport, warum fließen die öffentlichen Gelder fast ausschließlich in Richtung des organisierten Vereinssports, und wie erklärt sich die Höhe von Sportbudgets oder die Tatsache, daß Sportpolitik in erster Linie eine kommunale Angelegenheit ist? Die Daten für die zahlreichen empirischen Analysen wurden größtenteils vom Autor selbst erhoben. So fließen u.a. Abfragen kommunaler Sportförderrichtlinien und Sportbudgets sowie eine Studie zum Werbewert von Sportstätten in die Arbeit mit ein.

Virtuosismo y revolución: la acción política en la era del desencanto,Paolo Virno,political_science,First published in 2003,/works/OL17783749W?edition=ia%3A2003VirtuosismoYRevolucion,/authors/OL481365A/Paolo_Virno,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26373171M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  Traficantes de Sueños|Language Spanish|Pages 154,"El término ""virtuosismo"" tiene aquí varias acepciones. Una primera que se podría identificar plenamente con la virtud republicana de Maquiavelo, la pasión civil que anima la construcción de los asuntos comunes. Pero existe desde luego otra, una segunda, más extravagante, menos reconocida, que coincide con la buena ejecución, la good perfomance de los ""trabajadores sin obra"", de los músicos, los artistas, los intérpretes, pero también los vendedores, los publicistas, las trabajadoras del sexo, las cuidadoras sociales.  La colección de ensayos de Paolo Virno reunidos bajo el título Virtuosismo y revolución remite a las condiciones de la virtud política de los ""trabajadores sin obra"". Precisamente cuando cantidades cada vez mayores de trabajo no tienen como finalidad exclusiva producir objetos materiales, sino más bien comunicación o interacción social (tal y como reconocen las nuevas categorías globales de sociedad del conocimiento o de la información) repensar las formas de acción política adecuadas al nuevo virtuosismo del trabajo deviene un propósito central.  La obra de Virno es una apuesta teórica por la reconstrucción de una política radical, más allá del desencanto hegemónico y de la peligrosa amenaza de los nuevos fascismos e integrismos, a través de nuevas categorías ajustadas a las grandes transformaciones del trabajo, a eso que se ha dado en llamar postfordismo. Categorías extrañas a las principales corrientes de la tradición radical, pero que sin embargo se reconocen en su expresión más profunda: soviet, éxodo, esfera pública no estatal, intelectualidad de masas, derecho de resistencia.

Congress, the press, and individuals debated more than thirty titles, many of which had royal associations and some of which were clearly monarchical. For Fear of an Elective King is Kathleen Bartoloni-Tuazon's rich account of the title controversy and its meanings. The short, intense legislative phase and the prolonged, equally intense public phase animated and shaped the new nation's broadening political community. Rather than simply reflecting an obsession with etiquette, the question challenged Americans to find an acceptable balance between power and the people's sovereignty while assuring the country's place in the Atlantic world. Bartoloni-Tuazon argues that the resolution of the controversy in favor of the modest title of ""President"" established the importance of recognition of the people's views by the president and evidence of modesty in the presidency, an approach to leadership that fledged the presidency's power by not flaunting it. How the country titled the president reflected the views of everyday people, as well as the recognition by social and political elites of the irony that authority rested with acquiescence to egalitarian principles. The controversy's outcome affirmed the republican character of the country's new president and government, even as the conflict was the opening volley in increasingly partisan struggles over executive power. As such, the dispute is as relevant today as in 1789.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The last ten years have revealed more clearly than ever the role of nonviolence. Propped up by the media, funded by the government, and managed by NGOs, nonviolent campaigns around the world have helped oppressive regimes change their masks, and have helped police to limit the growth of rebellious social movements...The Failure of Nonviolence examines most of the major social upheavals since the end of the Cold War to establish what nonviolence can accomplish, and what a diverse, unruly, non-pacified movement can accomplish. Focusing especially on the Arab Spring, Occupy, and the recent social upheavals in Europe, this book discusses how movements for social change can win ground and open the spaces necessary to plant the seeds of a new world.

"New Approaches to the Dynamics, Measurement and Economic Implications of Ethnic Diversity",Philipp Kolo,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL20929389W,/authors/OL8011382A/Philipp_Kolo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Language English|Pages 185,"This book examines the measurement and econometric effects of ethnic diversity. This issue is of great relevance to research and policy and is currently being discussed a great deal in the literature. In particular, a sizable literature has suggested that ethnic diversity constitutes a significant barrier to economic development. The precise measurement and interpretation of these results are a matter of substantial controversy. In this book, the dynamics of ethnic diversity are being empirically analyzed for the first time. Furthermore, it develops and applies a new measure of ethnic diversity which takes the distance between groups into account, thus focusing on diversity rather than mere fragmentation. This book convincingly confronts theoretical considerations with (new) data and thereby provides a good mix of theory and empirics, making significant contributions to the current debates.

Popular accounts have cherry-picked from the Vietnamese past to tell politicized, American-centered stories--either reducing the story of Vietnam and the Vietnamese to a noble tradition of anticolonial resistance embodied by the communist leader Ho Chi Minh, or alternatively seeking to rehabilitate American allies by making similarly essentialist claims about ""the Vietnamese"" and their history. Now, over forty years after the end of the American war in Vietnam, the events which created the modern state of Vietnam can be seen in truly historical perspective. Christopher Goscha tells the story of this fascinating and complex country on its own terms, emphasizing the contingency that characterizes Vietnam's history and the diversity of its people, polities, geography, and experiences as both colonized and colonizers""--  Contains primary source material.

A Penguin Classic The year 2019 marks the 150th anniversary of Mohandas Karamchand (Mahatma) Gandhi's birth, and Penguin Classics presents a short but comprehensive selection of text by Gandhi that speaks to non-violent civil disobedience and activism. In excerpts drawn from his books, letters, and essays-including from Hind Swaraj, Satyagraha in South Africa, Yeravda Mandir, Ashram Observances in Action, his readings of Thoreau and Tolstoy, and his essays on the life of Socrates-the reader observes the power and eloquence in which Gandhi expressed his views on non-violent resistance, which have inspired activists from the U.S. Civil Rights movement and around the world. The Power of Nonviolent Resistance includes a new introduction and suggestions for further exploration by renowned Gandhi scholar Tridip Suhrud, which gives context to the time of Gandhi's writings while placing them firmly into the present-day political climate, inspiring a new generation of activists to follow the civil rights hero's teachings and practices.

Ahmet Cavuldak rekonstruiert die Entstehungsgeschichte der religionspolitischen Ordnungen Frankreichs, der USA und Deutschlands entlang der wichtigsten Schwellenepochen und Aushandlungsprozesse. Anhand der Werke von Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de Tocqueville und Jürgen Habermas stellt er drei ""exemplarische"" Antworten auf die Frage nach dem rechten Verhältnis von Religion und Politik in der Demokratie vor. Diese ideengeschichtliche Auseinandersetzung mündet in eine systematische Diskussion der zur Rechtfertigung der Trennung von Religion und Politik genannten Gründe.

Levinas' exploration of the ethical serves as point of entry and is shown to be seeking inter-cultural political relevance through engagement with the issues of postcoloniality and humanism. Yet, Levinas fails to realise the ethical implications of the inevitable instrumental mediation between ethical meaning and political practice. With recourse to Weber, Apel and Ricoeur, Ernst Wolff proposes a theory of strategic co-responsibility for the uncertain global context of practice.

A number of cases prsented show the result of different (and often combined) motivations and actions. The most effective responses are those with a holistic, integrated and long-term approach, addressing both climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on citizen and other local stakeholder involvement. Local climate action means addressing different sectors, from buildings to waste, but also involving the industry and business sectors. The focus is on engaging communities on a large scale.  Local governments, together with other actors, play an essential role in this regard: creating a vision for the community, developing relevant strategies, implementing effective policies and rolling out actions. They lead citizens, act in an exemplary manner, and improve energy use in services.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf,              Knopf|Language English|Pages 294","From two of our most fiercely moral voices, a passionate call to arms against our era's most pervasive human rights violation: the oppression of women and girls in the developing world.With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women's potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it's also the best strategy for fighting poverty.Deeply felt, pragmatic, and inspirational, Half the Sky is essential reading for every global citizen. - From the Hardcover edition.

Lightning out of Lebanon,Tom Diaz,political_science,First published in 2005,/works/OL1939672W?edition=ia%3Alightningoutofle00diaz,/authors/OL232739A/Tom_Diaz,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17966859M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Ballantine Books|Language English|Pages 250,"Before September 11, 2001, one terrorist group had killed more Americans than any other: Hezbollah, the ""Party of God."" Today it remains potentially more dangerous than even al Qaeda. Yet little has been known about its inner workings, past successes, and future plans--until now.Written by an accomplished journalist and a law-enforcement expert, Lightning Out of Lebanon is a chilling and essential addition to our understanding of the external and internal threats to America. In disturbing detail, it portrays the degree to which Hezbollah has infiltrated this country and the extent to which it intends to do us harm.Formed in Lebanon by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, Hezbollah is fueled by hatred of Israel and the United States. Its 1983 truck-bomb attack against the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut killed 241 soldiers--the largest peacetime loss ever for the U.S. military--and caused President Reagan to withdraw all troops from Lebanon. Since then, among other atrocities, Hezbollah has murdered Americans at the U.S. embassy in Lebanon and the Khobar Towers U.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia; tortured and killed the CIA station chief in Beirut; held organizational meetings with top members of al Qaeda--including Osama bin Laden--and established sleeper cells in the United States and Canada.Lightning Out of Lebanon reveals how, starting in 1982, a cunning and deadly Hezbollah terrorist named Mohammed Youssef Hammoud operated a cell in Charlotte, North Carolina, under the radar of American intelligence. The story of how FBI special agent Rick Schwein captured him in 2002 is a brilliantly researched and written account.Yet the past is only prologue in the unsettling odyssey of Hezbollah. Using their exclusive sources in the Middle East and inside the U.S. counterterrorism establishment, the authors of Lightning Out of Lebanon imagine the deadly future of Hezbollah and posit how best to combat the group which top American counterintelligence officials and Senator Bob Graham, vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have called ""the A Team of terrorism.""From the Hardcover edition.

Dispatches from Pakistan,Madiha R. Tahir,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL19986812W,/authors/OL7597186A/Madiha_R._Tahir,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 288,""" Since 9/11, Pakistan has loomed large in the geopolitical imagination of the West. A key ally in the global war on terror, it is also the country in which Osama bin Laden was finally found and killed--and the one that has borne the brunt of much of the ongoing conflict's collateral damage. Despite its prominence on the front lines and on the front pages, Pakistan has been depicted by Western observers simplistically in terms of its corruption, its fundamentalist Islamic beliefs, and its propensity for violence. Dispatches from Pakistan, in contrast, reveals the complexities, the challenges, and the joys of daily life in the country, from the poetry of Gilgit to the graffiti of Gwadar, from an army barrack in Punjab to the urban politics of Karachi.This timely book brings together journalists, activists, academics, and artists to provide a rich, in-depth, and intriguing portrait of contemporary Pakistani society. Straddling a variety of boundaries--geographic, linguistic, and narrative--Dispatches from Pakistan is a vital attempt to speak for the multitude of Pakistanis who, in the face of seemingly unimaginable hardships, from drone strikes to crushing poverty, remain defiantly optimistic about their future. While engaging in conversations on issues that make the headlines in the West, the contributors also introduce less familiar dimensions of Pakistani life, highlighting the voices of urban poets, rural laborers, industrial workers, and religious-feminist activists--and recovering Pakistani society's inquilabi (revolutionary) undercurrents and its hopeful overtones.Contributors: Mahvish Ahmad; Nosheen Ali, U of California, Berkeley; Shafqat Hussain, Trinity College; Humeira Iqtidar, King's College London; Amina Jamal, Ryerson U; Hafeez Jamali, U of Texas at Austin; Iqbak Khattak; Zahra Malkani; Raza Mir; Hammad Nasar; Junaid Rana, U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Maliha Safri, Drew U; Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, Lahore U of Management Sciences; Ayesha Siddiqa; Sultan-i-Rome, Government Jahanzeb Postgraduate College, Swat, Pakistan; Saadia Toor, Staten Island College.

The contributors to this anthology don't simply describe these problems or warn about the loss of privacy-they propose solutions. They look closely at business practices, public policy, and technology design, and ask, ""Should this continue? Is there a better approach?"" They take seriously the dictum of Thomas Edison: ""What one creates with his hand, he should control with his head."" It's a new approach to the privacy debate, one that assumes privacy is worth protecting, that there are solutions to be found, and that the future is not yet known. This volume is a reference for policy makers and researchers, journalists and scholars, and others looking for answers to one of the biggest challenges of our modern day.

Reid crisscrosses the globe in search of exact solutions to the urgent tax problems of the United States.

This is a phase defined by multinational firms cut loose from the nation-state framework and free to chase profits over the entire surface of the globe. No longer dependent on nation-states for building a political consensus that accommodates capital accumulation, these firms seek to bend governments to their will and destroy barriers to the free movement of capital. And while military force continues to play an important role in imperial strategy, it is the discipline of the global market that keeps workers in check by pitting them against each other no matter what their national origin. This is a world in which the so-called ""labor aristocracies"" of the rich nations are demolished, the power of states to enforce checks on capital is sapped, and global firms are free to pursue their monomaniacal quest for profits unfettered by national allegiance. Screpanti delves into the inner workings of global imperialism, explaining how it is different from past forms of imperialism, how the global distribution of wages is changing, and why multinational firms have strained to break free of national markets. He sees global imperialism as a developing process, one with no certain outcome. But one thing is clear: when economic crises become opportunities to discipline workers, and when economic policies are imposed through increasingly authoritarian measures, the vision of a democratic and humane world is what is ultimately at stake""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The belief that religion was dying became the conventional wisdom in the social sciences during most of the twentieth century. The traditional secularization thesis needs updating, however, religion has not disappeared and is unlikely to do so. Nevertheless, the concept of secularization captures an important part of what is going on. This book develops a theory of existential security. It demonstrates that the publics of virtually all advanced industrial societies have been moving toward more secular orientations during the past half century, but also that the world as a whole now has more people with traditional religious views than ever before. This second edition expands the theory and provides new and updated evidence from a broad perspective and in a wide range of countries. This confirms that religiosity persists most strongly among vulnerable populations, especially in poorer nations and in failed states. Conversely, a systematic erosion of religious practices, values, and beliefs has occurred among the more prosperous strata in rich nations""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Max Weber in Politics and Social Thought is the first comprehensive account of Weber's wide-ranging impact on both German and American intellectuals. Drawing on a wide range of sources, Joshua Derman illuminates what Weber meant to contemporaries in the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany and analyzes why they reached for his concepts to articulate such widely divergent understandings of modern life. It also accounts for the transformations that Weber's concepts underwent at the hands of e;migre; and American scholars, and in doing so, elucidates one of the major intellectual movements of the mid-twentieth century: the transatlantic migration of German thought""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Berlin as the reborn German capital has put 'coming to terms with' the Holocaust and the memory of the GDR full square at the centre of urban planning.  Detroit raises questions about the impotence and complicity of planners in the face of the most extreme metropolitan spatial apartheid in the United States and where African-American identity now seems set on a separatist course.  In Belfast, in the clash of Irish nationalist and Ulster unionist traditions, place can take on intense emotional meanings in relation to which planners as 'mediators of space' can seem ill equipped.The book, drawing on extensive interview sources in the case study cities, poses a question of broad relevance.  Can planners fashion a role in using environmental concerns such as Local Agenda 21 as a vehicle of building a sense of common citizenship in which cultural difference can embed itself?

Following the phenomenal success of General George C. Marshall's leadership of the American army during World War II, he was the standout candidate for a vital international mission: brokering a coalition government between China's warring Nationalists and Communists. Marshall went overseas as a U.S. ""special representative"" and began enacting miraculous change. Under Marshall's guiding hand, China's embattled political factions agreed to a ceasefire and settled on the principles of a democratic government. But over the next ten months, Marshall's mission soured: the agreements he brokered fractured and civil war came to China after all. This fascinating narrative history portrays the incredible beginnings and ultimate failure of Marshall's high-stakes mission, with a remarkable cast of characters featuring a heroes' gallery of American diplomats--Truman, Eisenhower, MacArthur, and many others. In spellbinding, pinpoint detail, The China Mission chronicles an unforgettable misstep in American diplomacy that changed the course of global politics forevermore.""--Provided by publisher.

Based on extensive new research, this study exposes the intimate links between debates on the 'woman question' and the constitution of 'colonial discourse' in order to highlight the centrality of empire to white middle-class women's activism in Britain.The book begins by exploring the relationship between the construction of new knowledge about colonised others and the framing of debates on the 'woman question' among advocates of women's rights and their evangelical opponents. Moving on to examine white middle-class women's activism on imperial issues in Britain, topics include the anti-slavery boycott of Caribbean sugar, the campaign against widow-burning in colonial India, and women's role in the foreign missionary movement prior to direct employment by the major missionary societies. Finally, Clare Midgley highlights how the organised feminist movement which emerged in the late 1850s linked promotion of female emigration to Britain's white settler colonies to a new ideal of independent English womanhood. This original work throws fascinating new light on the roots of later 'imperial feminism' and contemporary debates concerning women's rights in an era of globalisation and neo-imperialism.

Stewart restores James Madison, sometimes overshadowed by his fellow Founders, to his proper place as the most significant framer of the new nation. Short, plain, balding, neither soldier nor orator, low on charisma and high on intelligence, Madison cared more about achieving results than taking the credit. To reach his lifelong goal of a self-governing constitutional republic, he blended his talents with those of key partners. It was Madison who led the drive for the Constitutional Convention and pressed for an effective new government as his patron George Washington lent the effort legitimacy; Madison who wrote the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton to secure the Constitution's ratification; Madison who corrected the greatest blunder of the Constitution by drafting and securing passage of the Bill of Rights with Washington's support; Madison who joined Thomas Jefferson to found the nation's first political party and move the nation toward broad democratic principles; Madison, with James Monroe, who guided the new nation through its first war in 1812, really its Second War of Independence; and it was Madison who handed the reins of government to the last of the Founders, his old friend and sometime rival Monroe. These were the main characters in his life. But it was his final partnership that allowed Madison to escape his natural shyness and reach the greatest heights. Dolley was the woman he married in middle age and who presided over both him and an enlivened White House. This partnership was a love story, a unique one that sustained Madison through his political rise, his presidency, and a fruitful retirement""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Green to Ronald Dworkin. Besides giving a full analysis of the contents of each text, The Political Classics also highlights what makes the works of central importance to an understanding of political philosophy. The twelve chapters concentrate on the ideas contained in the texts, rather than on the lives of their writers, and each chapter is supplemented with useful suggestions for further reading. The clear analysis and explanation contained in each essay allow the reader to study the original texts with new understanding and insight.

Timothy Heppell integrates a chronological narrative with theoretical evaluation, examining the interplay between the ideology of Conservatism and the political practice of the Conservative Party both in government and in opposition. He considers the ethos of the Party within the context of statecraft theory, looking at the art of winning elections and of governing competently. The book opens with an examination of the triumph and subsequent degeneration of one-nation Conservatism in the 1945 to 1965 period, and closes with an analysis of the party's re-entry into government as a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010, and of the developing ideology and approach of the Cameron-led Tory party in government""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wissenschaftler aus beiden Ländern liefern eine historische Analyse des deutsch-amerikanischen Verhältnisses ab 1945 und der Rolle John J. McCloys, Hochkommissar für Deutschland. Sie identifizieren Themen für den politischen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Transfer. Eine Voraussetzung für diesen Transfer ist die Ausbildung des deutschen Führungskräfte-Nachwuchses in den USA. Auf der Basis der mehrschichtigen Interdependenzstrukturen der zwei westlichen Industriestaaten entsteht Bedarf an - transatlantisch geprägten - globalen Akteuren.

In this timely and important book, Abdel Bari Atwan draws on his unrivaled knowledge of the global jihadi movement and Middle Eastern geopolitics to reveal the origins and modus operandi of Islamic State. Based on extensive field research and exclusive interviews with IS insiders, Atwan outlines the group's leadership structure, as well as its strategies, tactics and diverse methods of recruitment. He traces the Salafi-jihadi lineage of IS, its ideological differences with al-Qa'ida and the deadly rivalry that has emerged between their leaders. Atwan also shows how the group's rapid growth has been facilitated by its masterful command of social media platforms, the 'dark web', Hollywood 'blockbuster'-style videos, and even jihadi computer games, producing a powerful paradox where the ambitions of the Middle Ages have re-emerged in cyber-space. As Islamic State continues to dominate the world's media headlines with horrific acts of ruthless violence, Atwan considers the movement's chances of survival and expansion, and offers indispensable insights on potential government responses to contain the IS threat""--Provided by publisher.

The individual chapters examine the ideology and practices of legitimation, views of rulership, conceptualizations of ruler-minister relations, economic thought, and the bureaucratic administration of commoners. The contributors analyze the formation of power relations from various angles, ranging from artistic expression to religious ideas, political rhetoric, and administrative action. They demonstrate the interrelatedness of historiography and political ideology and show how the same text served both to strengthen the ruler's authority and moderate his excesses. Together, the chapters highlight the immense complexity of ancient Chinese political thought, and the deep tensions running within it. Contributors include Scott Cook, Joachim Gentz, Paul R. Goldin, Romain Graziani, Martin Kern, Liu Zehua, Luo Xinhui, Yuri Pines, Roel Sterckx, and Charles Sanft""--Provided by publisher.

The subject of liberation,Charles H.

It initially follows the argument developed in The Ticklish Subject that contemporary leftist thought is divided by antagonism between a Marxist revolutionary politics founded on Enlightenment philosophy and a politics of identity founded on post-modern post-structuralism. How Žižek used Lacan's theory of character structures is examined here to describe this theoretical deadlock and explain how the dominant contemporary ideologies of liberal tolerant multiculturalism and reactionary ""pseudo-fundamentalism"" compete to mobilize the individual subject's unconscious drive to enjoyment. The book thus emphasizes the moments in which Žižek hints that Lacanian theory may describe a practice that facilitates the resolution of antagonisms that placate radical leftist politics. It challenges prevalent interpretations of Lacanian ends of analysis, to ultimately connect the psychoanalytic cure to the leftist project of social and political liberation. The Subject of Liberation argues that if Lacan is to be useful to leftist politics, then the left has to develop its own definitions of the post-analytic subject, and proposes one such definition developed out of Lacanian and Zizekian theory""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

National intelligence and science,Wilhelm Agrell,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL19992257W?edition=ia%3Anationalintellig0000agre,/authors/OL88811A/Wilhelm_Agrell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27172370M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 219,"""Intelligence is currently facing increasingly challenging cross-pressures from both a need for accurate and timely assessments of potential or imminent security threats and the unpredictability of many of these emerging threats. We are living in a social environment of growing security and intelligence challenges, yet the traditional, narrow intelligence process is becoming increasingly insufficient for coping with diffuse, complex, and rapidly-transforming threats. The essence of intelligence is no longer the collection, analysis, and dissemination of secret information, but has become instead the management of uncertainty in areas critical for overriding security goals--not only for nations, but also for the international community as a whole. For its part, scientific research on major societal risks like climate change is facing a similar cross-pressure from demand on the one hand and incomplete data and developing theoretical concepts on the other. For both of these knowledge-producing domains, the common denominator is the paramount challenges of framing and communicating uncertainty and of managing the pitfalls of politicization National Intelligence and Science is one of the first attempts to analyze these converging domains and the implications of their convergence, in terms of both more scientific approaches to intelligence problems and intelligence approaches to scientific problems. Science and intelligence constitute, as the book spells out, two remarkably similar and interlinked domains of knowledge production, yet ones that remain traditionally separated by a deep political, cultural, and epistemological divide. Looking ahead, the two twentieth-century monoliths--the scientific and the intelligence estates--are becoming simply outdated in their traditional form. The risk society is closing the divide, though in a direction not foreseen by the proponents of turning intelligence analysis into a science, or the new production of scientific knowledge""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Writings and speeches,Edmund Burke,political_science,First published in 1901,/works/OL19666707W,/authors/OL2658712A/Edmund_Burke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1901|Publisher  Little Brown and Co.|Language English|Pages 12,"Burke, Edmund (1729-97), political writer. Born in Dublin, he was educated at Trinity College and studied law in London. He was private secretary to the chief secretary for Ireland, William Gerard Hamilton, 1764, and from 1765 private secretary to Lord Rockingham. Elected to the British parliament in 1765, he emerged as a leading orator and theorist of the new reformist Whig Party. He attacked George III's personal government, called for conciliatory treatment of the American colonists, introduced an economical reform bill (1780) to reduce official corruption, and led the attack on Warren Hastings's abuse of power in India. Following the French Revolution, however, Burke became a defender of the existing order against what he saw as a destructive quest for abstract liberty, publishing Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) and breaking with his Whig colleague Charles James Fox. ""Burke's mother was a Catholic of the Co. Cork Nagle family and he was shaken when Nagle relatives were caught up in the show trials of prominent Catholics, provoked by the Whiteboy movement. He was partly educated as a Catholic school in Co. Cork, his wife was an Irish Catholic, and his lawyer father may have been a convert. Yet opinion is divided between those who see this background as shaping his whole political outlook and those who see the mature Burke primarily as a metropolitan reformer. His open advocacy of free trade for Ireland cost him his Bristol constituency in 1780. On the other hand he was cool towards legislative independence, which he saw as strengthening an intolerant Protestant elite. In the 1790s, notably in his Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792), he advocated Catholic relief as the only means to prevent revolution in Ireland."" - (Oxford Campanion Irish History) Vol. I: A Vindication of Natural Society, On the Sublime and Beautiful, Present State of the Nation, etc. Vol. 2: On Conciliation with America, Security if the Independence of Parliament, On Mr. Fox's East India Bill, etc. Vol. 3: On the Nabob of Arcot's Debts, Speech on the Army Estimates, Reflections on the Revolution in France.

Born in Dublin, he was educated at Trinity College and studied law in London. He was private secretary to the chief secretary for Ireland, William Gerard Hamilton, 1764, and from 1765 private secretary to Lord Rockingham. Elected to the British parliament in 1765, he emerged as a leading orator and theorist of the new reformist Whig Party. He attacked George III's personal government, called for conciliatory treatment of the American colonists, introduced an economical reform bill (1780) to reduce official corruption, and led the attack on Warren Hastings's abuse of power in India. Following the French Revolution, however, Burke became a defender of the existing order against what he saw as a destructive quest for abstract liberty, publishing Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) and breaking with his Whig colleague Charles James Fox. ""Burke's mother was a Catholic of the Co. Cork Nagle family and he was shaken when Nagle relatives were caught up in the show trials of prominent Catholics, provoked by the Whiteboy movement. He was partly educated as a Catholic school in Co. Cork, his wife was an Irish Catholic, and his lawyer father may have been a convert. Yet opinion is divided between those who see this background as shaping his whole political outlook and those who see the mature Burke primarily as a metropolitan reformer. His open advocacy of free trade for Ireland cost him his Bristol constituency in 1780. On the other hand he was cool towards legislative independence, which he saw as strengthening an intolerant Protestant elite. In the 1790s, notably in his Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792), he advocated Catholic relief as the only means to prevent revolution in Ireland."" - (Oxford Campanion Irish History) Vol. I: A Vindication of Natural Society, On the Sublime and Beautiful, Present State of the Nation, etc. Vol. 2: On Conciliation with America, Security if the Independence of Parliament, On Mr. Fox's East India Bill, etc. Vol. 3: On the Nabob of Arcot's Debts, Speech on the Army Estimates, Reflections on the Revolution in France.

Insbesondere im französischen Sprachraum ist die Differenz zwischen dem Politischen und der Politik zum Ausgangspunkt einer Erneuerung der politischen Theorie geworden, die das Politische abhebt von »bloßer Politik«. Was genau diese Differenz bezeichnet, hängt davon ab, ob das Politische als Norm der Politik, als hegemoniale Intervention, als Ereignis der Unterbrechung oder der Stiftung von Politik formuliert wird. Der Band zeichnet in kritischer Diskussion die Grundlinien der theoretischen Erneuerung nach, die Denker wie Alain Badiou, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe und Jean-Luc Nancy vorangetrieben haben und deren Wurzeln sich auf so unterschiedliche Autoren wie Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt und Hannah Arendt zurückverfolgen lassen.

The first part of this work analyzes social morality as a system of authoritative moral rules. Drawing on an earlier generation of moral philosophers such as Kurt Baier and Peter Strawson as well as current work in the social sciences, Gaus argues that our social morality is an evolved social fact, which is the necessary foundation of a mutually beneficial social order. The second part considers how this system of social moral authority can be justified to all moral persons. Drawing on the tools of game theory, social choice theory, experimental psychology, and evolutionary theory, Gaus shows how a free society can secure a moral equilibrium that is endorsed by all, and how a just state respects, and develops, such an equilibrium""--Provided by publisher.

It looks back to the Ethics as the Ethics looks forward to the Politics. For Aristotle did not separate, as we are inclined to do, the spheres of the statesman and the moralist. In the Ethics he has described the character necessary for the good life, but that life is for him essentially to be lived in society, and when in the last chapters of the Ethics he comes to the practical application of his inquiries, that finds expression not in moral exhortations addressed to the individual but in a description of the legislative opportunities of the statesman. It is the legislator's task to frame a society which shall make the good life possible. Politics for Aristotle is not a struggle between individuals or classes for power, nor a device for getting done such elementary tasks as the maintenance of order and security without too great encroachments on individual liberty. The state is ""a community of well-being in families and aggregations of families for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life."" The legislator is a craftsman whose material is society and whose aim is the good life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

JFK and LBJ,Godfrey Hodgson,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL19663991W?edition=ia%3Ajfklbjlasttwogre0000hodg,/authors/OL340019A/Godfrey_Hodgson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26883214M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 274,"""As a young White House correspondent during the Kennedy and Johnson years in Washington, D.C., Godfrey Hodgson had a ringside seat covering the last two great presidents of the United States, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, two men who could not have been more different. Kennedy's wit and dashing style, his renown as a national war hero, and his Ivy League Boston Brahmin background stood in sharp contrast to Lyndon Johnson's rural, humble origins in Texas, his blunt, forceful (but effective) political style, his lackluster career in the navy, and his grassroots populist instincts. Hodgson, a sharp-eyed witness throughout the tenure of these two great men, now offers us a new perspective enriched by his reflections since that time a half-century ago. He offers us a fresh, dispassionate contrast of these two great men by stripping away the myths to assess their achievements, ultimately asking whether Johnson has been misjudged. He suggests that LBJ be given his due by history, arguing that he was as great a president as, perhaps even greater than, JFK. The seed that grew into this book was the author's early perception that JFK's performance in office was largely overrated while LBJ's was consistently underrated. Hodgson asks key questions: If Kennedy had lived, would he have matched Johnson's ambitious Great Society achievements? Would he have avoided Johnson's disastrous commitment in Vietnam? Would Nixon have been elected his successor, and if not, how would American politics and parties look today? Hodgson combines lively anecdotes with sober analyses to arrive at new conclusions about the U.S. presidency and two of the most charismatic figures ever to govern from the Oval Office."" -- Publisher's description.

Fue un gran gusto, y por qué no decirlo, un verdadero deleite leer esta novela, imposible de soltar una vez que se ha comenzado. Conjeturo que fue escrita casi sin descanso, así como habrá de ser leída. Me he reído a más no poder desde el principio hasta el fin; sin embargo, a veces risa amarga por nuestra desventura, pero risa al fin. En esta novela, escrita más bien como un cuento largo, Víctor recrea una especie de ser supremo muy tropical al que nunca abandona y al que va llevando por una serie de situaciones, todas de corte político, con humor exorbitante, y a veces hasta con humor negro, que habrá de hacer que el lector se detenga para carcajearse y luego reflexione acerca de cómo fue posible que las situaciones que él expone se hayan dado. Pero se dan. Como todo buen relato latinoamericano, desde el mero principio, Víctor va dando a conocer a su personaje principal y al lector no le queda más que soltar una carcajada tras otra y darle crédito al autor por haber escrito un libro tan revelador y ameno""--Back cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Free Thoughts on Religion, the Church, and National Happiness",Bernard Mandeville,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL32327761W,/authors/OL5993357A/Bernard_Mandeville,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Bernard Mandeville was best known for The Fable of the Bees, in which he demolishes the supposed moral basis of society by a Hobbesian demonstration that civilization depends on vice. Today Mandeville is seen as a trenchant satirist of the manners and foibles of his age. He is also seen as a precursor of some of Adam Smith's doctrines, a forerunner in the field of sociology. A prescient analyst of the dynamics of our modern consumer society, Mandeville is author of a striking naturalistic account of the gradual evolution of modern society from its primitive antecedents. His literary signature, in a manner of speaking, is his famous paradox, ""private vices, public benefits."" This new edition of Free Thoughts is prefaced by a lengthy and informative introduction by Irwin Primer, who recreates not only the literary, political, and religious atmosphere surrounding Mandeville, but also the controversies that surrounded his writing in mid-eighteenth-century England. Primer includes textual notes on the first and second editions of this classic work. To understand Mandeville's Free Thoughts, one needs to situate it within the context of the religious and political controversies, ongoing subversion, fear and dormant warfare of his times. Those would eventually erupt again and for the last time in the bloody Jacobite rebellion of 1745-46. The first five chapters of the book explore religious and theological issues including the nature of belief and knowledge, the significance of rites and ceremonies, and controversies about Christian mysteries such as the Trinity and free will and predestination. The next five chapters explore controversial issues of church politics, including persecution and toleration across the centuries, the basis of Mandeville's anticlericalism. In the eleventh chapter, he turns aside from matters of religion to review the balance of powers in Britain's government, a mixed or limited monarchy. The final chapter is essentially a repetition of Mandeville's pleas for civil and religious peace through mutual toleration by opposing religious parties. Mandeville's work is of continuing interest to students of culture and history, religion and theology, and political science. Irwin Primer is professor emeritus at Rutgers University who has written widely on Mandeville and the Scottish tradition in philosophy.""--Provided by publisher.

The Public Philosophy,Hans Eysenck,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL32327887W,/authors/OL10607632A/Hans_Eysenck,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Begun in 1938 and completed only in 1955, The Public Philosophy offers as much a glimpse into the private philosophy of America's premier journalist of the twentieth century as it does a public philosophy. The basis of Lippmann's effort is """"that there is a deep disorder in our society which comes not from the machinations of our enemies and from the adversaries of the human condition but from within ourselves."""" He also provides a special sort of legacy to liberalism in its broadest sense - as the root approach to human existence that could provide civility and accommodation against incivilities and extremism, and that uniquely stood against the totalitarian counter-revolutions from Jacobism to Leninism. This work is a masterful defense of the public philosophy as a constitutional tradition, and can be easily read as such today. Paul Roazen, long identified with the analysis of Lippmann's work, points out that no matter how trenchantly Lippmann dissected democracy, and the populist faith in the people's wisdom, he still sought to study the world in order to help govern it. His constant flow of journalistic writing had the educative intent of raising the level of the public's knowledge. His rationalist conviction that clearheadedness on public matters can be effectively relayed to people is nowhere more evident than in The Public Philosophy. In this sense it is an argument for the democratic ideal that people can be rallied in defense of the public interest.""--Provided by publisher.

Eine zersplitterte Landschaft,,political_science,,/works/OL20930918W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Amsterdam university Press|Language Undetermined,"Die politische Landschaft der Niederlande wurde viele Jahre lang von drei Strömungen - den Christdemokraten, den Sozialdemokraten und den Liberalen - dominiert. Die Lage veränderte sich ab Mitte der 1960er Jahre: An die Stelle der vorherigen Stabilität trat eine immer grössere Unberechenbarkeit. Auch nahm die politische Zersplitterung zu und seit 2002 verzeichneten populistische Gruppierungen wiederholt Erfolge. Die raschen Veränderungen im Parteienspektrum sorgen bei oberflächlicher Betrachtung für eine Überbewertung der Unterschiede zwischen ""damals"" und ""heute"": Der aktuellen Instabilität steht die erstarrte Unbeweglichkeit der Vergangenheit gegenüber. Ein solches Bild ist jedoch eine Vereinfachung, denn auch in früheren Jahren konnten die politischen Spannungen eskalieren, und immer wieder scheiterten Kabinette vorzeitig. Neben allen Veränderungen sind somit auch Kontinuitäten und langfristig wirksame Traditionslinien in der niederländischen Politik zu beobachten.    Der Sammelband Eine zersplitterte Landschaft geht auf diese Kontinuitäten und Veränderungen ein, indem er all jene Parteien betrachtet, die im Jahr 2017 in die Zweite Kammer des niederländischen Parlaments gewählt worden sind. Die älteste von ihnen existiert bereits seit beinahe 100 Jahren (SGP), die jüngsten Parteien (DENK und FvD) sind erst kurz vor der Wahl gegründet worden. Fast alle Beiträge sind von Vertretern der wissenschaftlichen Büros der Parteien verfasst worden, wodurch ein einzigartiger Blickwinkel entstanden ist: wissenschaftliche Distanz kombiniert mit einer Betrachtung von ""innen heraus"".

Introducción. ¿Qué es la Política?  II. Lo que la Política es, o las Doce tesis sobre la Política        Primera: que la Política es la Política.        Segunda: que la Política es una actividad de los hombres.        Tercera: que la Política es una actividad libre, por lo que la conexión entre ella y la libertad es más estrecha de lo que parece.        Cuarta: que la Política es una actividad pública y superficial ma non troppo, y por ello no lo puede todo ni está en todo, ya que no todo es Política aunque todo sea politizable.        Quinta: que la actividad política tiene siempre un carácter teleológico que hace imposible la completa neutralidad.        Sexta: que la Política es por naturaleza polémica y conciliatoria al mismo tiempo.        Séptima: que la Política se compone de varios aspectos distintos y hasta en cierto modo opuestos, lo que explica las dificultades para captarla tanto en la práctica como en teoría.        Octava: que el sentido común y el sentido del humor importan más que lo que parece.        Novena: que no todos parecen tener la misma capacidad para comprender y hacer la Política.        Décima: que la Política no es universal.        Decimoprimera: que la Política crece sólo donde hay diversidad y complejidad y donde se puede hacer distinciones entre las diversas realidades sociales.        Decimosegunda: que existen posturas antipolíticas, incluso dentro de las que solemos considerar ideologías políticas, y que tanto el pan-politicismo como la despolitización son antipolíticos.  III. Acerca de lo que la Política no es, y de la distinción entre la Política y otras ciencias y actividades humanas        Política, Ciencia, Educación.        La Política y los economicismos.        Política, técnica, administración.        Política y Derecho.        Política, Moral y democracia.        Kelsen, la democracia y el relativismo ético.  IV.

BASIC LEARNING STYLES AND THE RELATIONSHIPS TO ACHIEVEMENT IN ALLIED HEALTH AND NURSING,Richard R. Rahr,political_science,First published in 1987,/works/OL8617685W,/authors/OL2897924A/Richard_R._Rahr,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 170,"In allied health and nursing, the importance of finding the most effective and efficient styles of learning are of great importance because of the enormous amounts of information that students have to learn and retain in very short periods of time. Therefore, determining student learning styles and learning environments becomes a high priority.  The purpose of this study was to determine the learning styles and preferred learning environments of allied health and nursing students. The relationships between learning styles student levels of achievement in didactic, scientific, and core courses were also studied.  One instrument, the Gregorc's Learning Style Delineator, classifies subjects into four distinct learning styles: abstract-random, concrete-sequential, abstract-sequential, and concrete-random. A second instrument, the Rahr Learning Environment Preference Instrument, designed by the author and modeled after an instrument used by Dunn, Dunn, and Price, identifies preferences students have for learning.  In this study, learning styles and learning environment preferences of students in four allied health disciplines (occupational therapy, physical therapy, medical technology, and physician assistant) and in nursing were compared. Participants were junior and senior students enrolled at the School of Allied Health Sciences and the School of Nursing at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas.  Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. Results include: (a) allied health students were predominantly caucasian single females, mean age of 24.8 years; (b) the predominant learning style was the concrete-sequential type; (c) whereas medical technology students were mostly (73.9%) concrete-sequential, occupational therapy students were mostly (55.6%) abstract-random; (d) favorite learning styles were note-taking, lecture and laboratory; (e) favorite learning environment was a quiet, informal and brightly-lit setting; and (f) most students preferred to study in the evening hours. Learning styles were not predictive of achievement in the case of nursing students. Additionally, there was no significant difference in learning style frequency distribution between the junior and senior nursing students.

Guerrero was born into a wealthy family in Guanajuato, Mexico, in 1882. While still a young man, he renounced his inheritance, claiming that he would rather earn his meals through manual labor than secure them by exploiting his fellow human beings. Within less than a decade, he was a central figure in the transnational revolutionary network established by the Organizational Council of the Mexican Liberal Party (PLM), which was dedicated to deposing the dictator Porfirio Díaz and promoting anar­chist revolution throughout Mexico. He was killed in battle at the age of twenty-eight in 1910.  Guerrero was also one of the most prolific and talented revolutionary writ­ers of his era, penning numerous articles that were known for both their literary style and their polemical force. In this volume, editor and translator Javier Sethness-Castro has collected a wide range of Guerrero’s work for the newspapers Revolucíon, Punto Rojo, and Regeneracíon, most of them appear­ing for the first time in English.

Defined by the two features of alternative communal practice and occasional revolutionary action, Christian communism is predicated on profound criticism of the way of the world. The book begins with Karl Kautsky – the leading thinker of second-generation Marxism – and his oft-ignored identification of this tradition. From there, it offers a series of case studies that deal with European instances, the Russian Revolution, and to East Asia. Here we find the emergence of Christian communism not only in China, but also in North Korea. This book will be a vital resource for scholars and students of religion and the many aspects of socialist tradition.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

It challenges political theorists of all colors to come up with no-frill, no-spin, tell-it-like-it-is explanations of the 50 most important political -isms, -archies, and -ocracies that have pertained since the time of Periclean Athens. At no public expense, the book explains each political theory in nothing more than two pages, 300 words, and some propaganda-style imagery, for we all know that a picture opportunity is worth a thousand words of dull interview.

Whereas past critiques and histories of the field have opened conversations about how to improve the pathway toward making the field into a science, the present volume presents a challenge--how to overcome the present situation in which the field has become characterized as a ""jigsaw puzzle,"" divided into small subfields with very little cross-interaction. The book starts with a description of the history and subfields of the discipline. The next sections recount well-accepted grand theories and paradigms of the past in order to encourage their further development, followed by illustrative interdisciplinary empirical tests involving political anthropology, political economy, and political sociology. Policy applications demonstrate how political scientists can influence public policy, including an exposition of a new methodology for options analysis. The purpose of the volume is to reveal how a future political science can be more integrated and respected by linking theory, research, and policy applications (theoretical science, empirical science, and applied science) together within the same scholarly studies, thereby reintegrating the profession.""--Amazon.com.

Primer ensayo sobre las categorías de las «ciencias políticas»,Gustavo Bueno,political_science,First published in 1991,/works/OL2419310W,/authors/OL333152A/Gustavo_Bueno,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1769977M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1991|Publisher  Cultural Rioja|Language Spanish|Pages 455,"En este libro ensayamos una primera reconstrucción, en un sistema teórico, de un conjunto de «categorías» políticas –tales como «Estado» (¿cabe hablar de Estado cuando nos referimos a la jefatura zulú de Shaka y luego de Mpanda?), «sociedad civil», «democracia», «dictadura» (¿puede hablarse de «dictadura de Franco» antes de 1947?), «partido político»– que constituyen, indudablemente, los sillares más característicos de cualquier tipo de pensamiento político, mundano o académico, de nuestros días. Estas categorías tienen, cada una de ellas, su materia propia, lo que no significa: unívoca o rígida; pero precisamente estas materias o contenidos se determinan y varían relativamente al componerse con otros contenidos formando esas «redes conceptuales» constitutivas de las «grandes concepciones» o «sistemas» políticos de nuestros días (socialismo, marxismo-leninismo, liberalismo, humanismo, aristocratismo, anarquismo, teología de la liberación... o escepticismo político, entendido éste no de un modo negativo –pues en tal caso carecería de todo interés, fuera del meramente psicológico o psiquiátrico– sino como docta ignorantia política). Estos «sistemas», asociados en general a las ideologías políticas de partidos, sindicatos o movimientos religiosos, atraviesan en estos años una profunda crisis. Unas veces, a consecuencia del desmoronamiento de la misma estructura racional del sistema, debido a los cambios que el curso de los acontecimientos ha dado a sus mismos «sillares» constitutivos –sería el caso del «marxismo-leninismo»; otras veces, porque el sistematismo logra mantenerse firme pero sólo gracias a una «asistencia mística» (islamismo, euskalherrismo, yanomamismo) que lo pone en el límite del delirio.

For the good society is the complete political good. If this directedness becomes explicit, if men make it their explicit goal to acquire knowledge of the good life and of the good society, political philosophy emerges. . . . The theme of political philosophy is mankind's great objectives, freedom and government or empire—objectives which are capable of lifting all men beyond their poor selves. Political philosophy is that branch of philosophy which is closest to political life, to non-philosophic life, to human life.""—From ""What Is Political Philosophy?""  What Is Political Philosophy?—a collection of ten essays and lectures and sixteen book reviews written between 1943 and 1957—contains some of Leo Strauss's most famous writings and some of his most explicit statements of the themes that made him famous. The title essay records Strauss's sole extended articulation of the meaning of political philosophy itself. Other essays discuss the relation of political philosophy to history, give an account of the political philosophy of the non-Christian Middle Ages and of classic European modernity, and present his theory of esoteric writing.

Only it did not. Instead, he chose to declass himself and to become a radical activist working for the oppressed of the country. Shocked by the racism he witnessed in the UK as a student and learning of the horrors of colonial rule in India, he determined to serve those struck the harshest by the cruel inequalities of his country.  Fractured Freedom takes you through the journey of an honest man and his partner, Anuradha, to a difficult destiny. Here is a story of people who dedicated their lives listening to their hearts pouring with empathy and service for the marginalized, and who believed that true revolution required direct action for a more human and just society. Part memoir, part prison diary, Ghandy bares it all looking back at their lives, love, loss and politics, so intrinsically tied together. Having languished in Indian prisons for over a decade, he tells of his long incarceration, of his fellow prisoners, and of the Kafkaesque experiences with the Indian legal system sending shivers down one’s spine. This is the candid and unfiltered account of how an unjust system breaks the brave and bold hearted. A story of a life in extremes – the height of privilege and the depth of despair, a story of our times, of a path many would shy away from.

The research was carried out through personal interviews of the actors who participated in the policy process, review of documents, reports, and correspondence. The case study permitted the exploration of the process by focusing on the consistency of the creation of the National Center for Nursing Research in respect to other institutes of the National Institutes of Health, the presence of windows of opportunity, the actors involved in the process, and the comparison to existing models of agenda building. Construct validity, internal and external validity, and reliability were established through triangulation and comparison of the researcher's interpretations by peer evaluation.  The process discovered in this case study cannot be generalized to existing agenda setting models after its initial stage, rather, both an accidental and suppression model would appear warranted. It reinforces the fact that issues follow different routes to achieve agenda status.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
AGENDA-SETTING AND POLICY DESIGN OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR NURSING RESEARCH LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT (LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS),Elizabeth Ann Furlong,political_science,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278795W,/authors/OL5368156A/Elizabeth_Ann_Furlong,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 226,"Process analysis of the National Center for Nursing Research legislative amendment was studied by a case study approach. The research was conducted to gain a better understanding of the agenda setting and policy design aspects of public policy. Theoretical models of Schneider and Ingram, Kingdon, and others served as the conceptual base for the data analysis. Data collection was obtained through government documents, professional archival documents, public media, and 38 personal and telephone interviews. Research findings supported these hypotheses--(1) policy is more likely to be initiated for those target populations who are positively perceived by Congressmen, (2) issues are more likely to reach formal agenda status when the political stream factors are related to positively perceived target populations, and (3) policy process is best understood in a contextual dimension. The confluence of the Schneider and Ingram model of 'social construction of target populations' with a modification of Kingdon's theory in concert with a contextual perspective was explanatory for the agenda setting of this policy. Policy outcomes of this 1983 legislation with changes made a decade later validated aspects of policy design theory.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Built in the 1940s atop an infamous Italian slum, Cabrini-Green grew to twenty-three towers and a population of 20,000--all of it packed onto just seventy acres a few blocks from Chicago's ritzy Gold Coast. Cabrini-Green became synonymous with crime, squalor, and the failure of government. For the many who lived there, it was also a much-needed resource--it was home. By 2011, every high-rise had been razed, the island of black poverty engulfed by the white affluence around it, the families dispersed. In this novelistic and eye-opening narrative, Ben Austen tells the story of America's public housing experiment and the changing fortunes of American cities. It is an account told movingly through the lives of residents who struggled to make a home for their families as powerful forces converged to accelerate the housing complex's demise. Beautifully written, rich in detail, and full of moving portraits, High-Risers is a sweeping exploration of race, class, popular culture, and politics in modern America that brilliantly considers what went wrong in our nation's effort to provide affordable housing to the poor--and what we can learn from those mistakes.

There is new interest in the ways in which migrants negotiate and renegotiate identities through their continued interactions with their own culture back home, in the host country, in similar diaspora elsewhere, and with the various ""new"" cultures of the receiving country. This collection focuses on two broad political and social contexts: the established Latino communities in urban settings in North America and newer Latin American communities in Europe and the Middle East. It explores the role of migration/diaspora in transforming linguistic practices, ideologies, and identities""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It has come increasingly    onto the agenda of policymakers, as interest in citizen participation has    more generally soared. Expectations are high and it is regarded as a possible    solution to the public sector?s decreased legitimacy and dwindling resources,    by accessing more of society?s capacities. In addition, it is seen as part of a    more general drive to reinvigorate voluntary participation and strengthen    social cohesion in an increasingly fragmented and individualized society.    Co-Production and Co-Creation: Engaging Citizens in Public Services    offers a systematic and comprehensive theoretical and empirical examination    of the concepts of co-production and co-creation and their application    in practice. It shows the latest state of knowledge on the topic and will    be of interest to students at an advanced level, academics and reflective    practitioners. It addresses the topics with regard to co-production and    co-creation and will be of interest to researchers, academics, policymakers,    and students in the fields of public administration, business administration,    economics, political science, public management, political science, service    management, sociology and voluntary sector studies.

James Schall's recent essays, Political Philosophy and Revelation offers a learned, erudite, and coherent statement on the relationship between reason and revelation in the modern world. It addresses political philosophy in the context of an awareness of other humane and practical sciences, including history, literature, economics, theology, ethics and metaphysics.  Today, revelation and reason are often thought to be in opposition to each other. This book looks at arguments and evidence for a more consistent reading of our experience and thought, one that would include the revelational contributions and the philosophy and politics it inspires. This is done in accord with ""the Catholic understanding of freedom and reason."" To see these connections, Schall looks to the readings of Plato to illustrate how revelation addresses itself to reason.  Political Philosophy and Revelation will prove to be an indispensable guide to the thinking and writing of Fr. Schall in the second decade of the twenty first century.

Things fall apart; the center cannot hold. The rules, policies, and institutions that have guided the world since World War II have largely run their course. Respect for sovereignty alone cannot uphold order in an age defined by global challenges from terrorism and the spread of nuclear weapons to climate change and cyberspace. Meanwhile, great-power rivalry is returning. Weak states pose problems just as confounding as strong ones. The United States remains the world's strongest country, but American foreign policy has at times made matters worse, both by what the United States has done and by what it has failed to do. The Middle East is in chaos, Asia is threatened by China's rise and a reckless North Korea, and Europe, for decades the world's most stable region, is now anything but. As Richard Haass explains, the election of Donald Trump and the unexpected vote for Brexit signals that many in modern democracies reject important aspects of globalization, including borders open to trade and immigrants. In A World in Disarray, Richard Haass argues for an updated global operating system--call it World Order 2.0--that reflects the reality that power is widely distributed and that borders count for less. One critical element of this adjustment will be adopting a new approach to sovereignty, one that embraces its obligations and responsibilities as well as its rights and protections. Haass also details how the United States should act towards China and Russia, as well as in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. He suggests, too, what the country should do to address its dysfunctional politics, mounting debt, and the lack of agreement on the nature of its relationship with the world. A World in Disarray is a wise examination, one rich in history, of the current world, along with how we got here and what needs doing. Haass shows that the world cannot have stability or prosperity without the United States, but that the United States cannot be a force for global stability and prosperity without its politicians and citizens reaching a new understanding.""--Dust jacket.
