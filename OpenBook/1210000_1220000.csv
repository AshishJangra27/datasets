Doch das Begriffsinventar, die Denkfiguren und die Forschungs- und Anwendungsfelder der Psychoanalyse sind nicht ohne weiteres verständlich und erfordern eine Hinführung. In diesem Buch werden aus unterschiedlichen Praxen der Forschung und Arbeit (der Kur, der Therapie, der Kulturwissenschaft, der Literaturwissenschaft, der Übersetzung und der Philosophie) grundlegende Begriffe entfaltet: Einfühlen, Unbewußtes, Symptom, Hysterie, Sexualität, Übertragung, Perversion.

Dieses Buch nimmt im Kontext des Jugendstrafvollzugs dazu Stellung. In der psychoanalytischen Einzel- und Gruppenarbeit mit jugendlichen Straftätern führt die Auseinandersetzung mit den juristischen Gesetzen stets auf das grundsätzliche Prinzip zurück, das die Psyche und ihr Begehren strukturiert - diese Hypothese untersucht das Buch nicht zuletzt vor dem Hintergrund der bei Jugendlichen virulenten Pubertätsproblematik. Anders als die in Mode gekommenen kognitiven und konfrontativen Trainingsprogramme für Straftäter sieht es die Psychoanalyse als ihre Aufgabe, ein Sprechen zu ermöglichen, das den Zusammenhang von Gesetz und eigenem Begehren zur Sprache kommen lässt, indem immer weiter geredet wird, und dadurch das Ausagieren von Konflikten mindert.

Erforderlich sind eine genaue Kenntnis der Strukturen und Methoden, die sich vom klassischen Setting unterscheiden. Die psychoanalytische Arbeit mit Psychotikern stützt sich auf ein kreatives Potential, das sich in künstlerischen Produktionen zeigt, von denen einige in diesem Band dargestellt und kommentiert werden.

Factor analysis,Suitbert Ertel,psychology,First published in 2013,/works/OL23497736W,/authors/OL1834163A/Suitbert_Ertel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen,"Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical tool for digging out hidden factors which give rise to the diversity of manifest objectives in psychology, medicine and other sciences. EFA had its heyday as psychologist Leon Thurstone (1935 and 1948) based EFA on what he called the “principle of simple structure” (SS). This principle, however, was erroneous from the beginning what remained unrecognized despite subsequent inventions of more sophisticated statistical tools such as confirmatory analysis and structural equation modeling. These methods are highly recommended today as tolerable routes to model complexities of observation. But they did not remove the harmful errors that SS had left behind. Five chapters in this book demonstrate and explain the trouble. In chapter 2 the ailment of SS is healed by introducing an unconventional factor rotation, called Varimin. Varimin gives variables of an analysis an optimal opportunity to manifest functional interrelations underlying correlational observations. Ten applications of Varimin (in chapter 2) show that its results are superior to results obtained by the conventional Varimax procedure. Further applications are presented for sports achievements (chapter 3), intelligence (chapter 4), and personality (chapter 5). If Varimin keeps on standing the tests new theoretical building blocks will arise together with conceptual networks promoting a better understanding of the domains under study. Readers may check this prognosis by themselves using the statistical tool (Varimin) which is provided by open access in the internet.

Schwerwiegende Fehlentscheidungen im Lebensrückblick,Andrea Lengert,psychology,First published in 2009,/works/OL23497813W,/authors/OL8908033A/Andrea_Lengert,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Universitätsverlag der Technischen Universität Berlin|Pages 206,"Both volumes deal with serious personal mistakes in the course of life. Part I, the basic research was conducted at the TU Berlin by Andrea Lengert and supervised by Prof. Dr. Gerd Jüttemann. In this exploratory qualitative project problem-centered interviews and the grounded theory approach for analyzing the data were used to examine what intra-individual processes follow a wrong decision. Part II, written by Jill Tegge, contains the results of a replication study, which was undertaken at the TU Braunschweig under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Schulz. The study uses comparative casuistry (""komparative Kasuistik""). In addition, an online questionnaire asking people about own errors in their past, was used to collect data.  Es geht um eine zweiteilige Studie, die sich gleichsam aus zwei Diplom-Arbeiten zusammensetzt. Beide handeln thematisch von gravierenden individuellen Fehlentscheidungen im Laufe des Lebens. Teil I, die grundlegende Untersuchung, wurde an der TU Berlin von Frau Dipl.-Psych. Andrea Lengert durchgeführt und von Prof. Dr. Gerd Jüttemann betreut. In dem explorativen qualitativen Projekt wurden Menschen nach dem Konzept des problemzentrierten Interviews befragt und die Daten nach dem Ansatz der Grounded Theory ausgewertet, um herauszufinden, welche intraindividuellen Prozesse nach einer Fehlentscheidung ablaufen.    Der Teil II, den Frau Dipl.-Psych. Jill Tegge verfasst hat, enthält in erster Linie die Ergebnisse einer Replikationsstudie, die an der TU Braunschweig unter der Betreuung von Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Schulz entstand. Hier kam die Forschungsstrategie der Komparativen Kasuistik zum Tragen. Außerdem wurden Menschen mithilfe eines Onlinefragebogens zu Fehlern in ihrer Vergangenheit befragt.    Da sich für die Resultate der beiden Arbeiten ein Ergänzungsverhältnis ergab, war die Zusammenfassung naheliegend.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A clue to answering this can be    found in cases where the mechanisms that produce inner speaking    behave unusually. In this paper, we suggest an account of a specific    instance of this, namely, a particular subtype of auditory verbal hallucination    (AVH), and draw some lessons about the processes that underlie    normal inner speech.

Phänomenale Adäquatheit und Irreduzibilität des Bewusstseins,Edwin Egeter,psychology,First published in 2020,/works/OL23502091W,/authors/OL7467793A/Edwin_Egeter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Pages 382,"Können objektiv feststellbare Prozesse, wie z.B. neuronale Vorgänge, subjektives Erleben wirklich hinreichend erklären? Mit der Frage, wie Bewusstsein aus physikalischen Prozessen zu erklären ist, dem hard problem, ist der schwierigste Teil des ehemaligen Körper-Geist-Problems in die aktuelle philosophische Debatte zurückgekehrt. In der kaum noch zu überblickenden Diskussionslage schafft Edwin Egeter Orientierung, indem er eine Typologie von sechs bipolaren Problem-Optiken auf das hard problem entwickelt. Sodann revidiert er den Begriff qualitativen Erlebens (Qualia), indem er ihn auf emotionale und kognitive Formen des Erlebens ausweitet. Auf dieser Grundlage zeigt er auf, dass Qualia mentale Phänomene darstellen, die wesentlich für bewusste Organismen sind. Ansätze, die Bewusstsein zu erklären versuchen, ohne qualitatives Erleben gebührend zu beachten, müssen deshalb scheitern.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Gibt es intuitive Erkenntnis? Intuition beschäftigt Philosophie, Psychologie und Alltagsdenken. Einschätzungen reichen dabei von „höchste Erkenntnisart“ bis „höchst unzuverlässig“. Cyrill Mamin zeichnet zentrale Bestimmungen der Intuition in Philosophie und Psychologie nach. Wesentliche Fragen sind dabei: Wie ist es, eine Intuition zu haben? Wie kommt eine Intuition zustande? Auf dieser Grundlage bestimmt Mamin Intuition als maßgeblich nicht-propositionale Erkenntnisart, welche unsere intuitiven Überzeugungen rechtfertigen kann. Im Zentrum steht ein neuartiges Modell der intuitiven Rechtfertigung, das psychologische mit erkenntnistheoretischen Elementen verbindet. Dadurch lässt sich Intuition im Verhältnis zu anderen mentalen Akten (u.a. Wahrnehmung, Imagination, Delusion) näher bestimmen sowie ein kritischer Blick auf die philosophische Intuitionsdebatte werfen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Factor analysis - Healing an ailing model,Suitbert Ertel,psychology,,/works/OL20932265W,/authors/OL1834163A/Suitbert_Ertel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language English,"Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical tool for digging out hidden factors which give rise to the diversity of manifest objectives in psychology, medicine and other sciences. EFA had its heyday as psychologist Leon Thurstone (1935 and 1948) based EFA on what he called the ?principle of simple structure? (SS). This principle, however, was erroneous from the beginning what remained unrecognized despite subsequent inventions of more sophisticated statistical tools such as confirmatory analysis and structural equation modeling. These methods are highly recommended today as tolerable routes to model complexities of observation. But they did not remove the harmful errors that SS had left behind. Five chapters in this book demonstrate and explain the trouble. In chapter 2 the ailment of SS is healed by introducing an unconventional factor rotation, called Varimin. Varimin gives variables of an analysis an optimal opportunity to manifest functional interrelations underlying correlational observations. Ten applications of Varimin (in chapter 2) show that its results are superior to results obtained by the conventional Varimax procedure. Further applications are presented for sports achievements (chapter 3), intelligence (chapter 4), and personality (chapter 5). If Varimin keeps on standing the tests new theoretical building blocks will arise together with conceptual networks promoting a better understanding of the domains under study. Readers may check this prognosis by themselves using the statistical tool (Varimin) which is provided by open access in the internet.

Leading researchers review widely used therapies for alcoholism, infantile autism, ADHD, and posttraumatic stress disorder; herbal remedies for depression and anxiety; suggestive techniques for memory recovery; and self-help models. Other topics covered include issues surrounding psychological expert testimony, the uses of projective assessment techniques, and unanswered questions about dissociative identity disorder. Providing knowledge to guide truly accountable mental health practice, the volume also imparts critical skills for designing and evaluating psychological research programs. It is ideal for use in advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in clinical psychology, psychotherapy, and evidence-based practice.

By age 12, he was in high school, and by 15 he was attending a top-ranking university.  And now, at the tender age of 18, he's on the verge of proving the Riemann Hypothesis, a mathematical equation that has mystified academics for almost 150 years. But only days before graduation, Mead suddenly packs his bags and flees home to rural Illinois. What has caused him to flee remains a mystery to all but Mead and a classmate whose quest for success has turned into a dangerous obession. At home, Mead finds little solace. His past ghosts haunt him; his parents don't understand the agony his genius has caused him, nor his desire to be a normal kid, and his dreams seem crushed forever. He embarks on a new life's journey -- learning the family business of selling furniture and embalming the dead--that disappoints and surprises all who knew him as ""the young Fegley genius.""Equal parts academic thriller and poignant coming-of-age story, LIFE AFTER GENIUS follows the remarkable journey of a young man who must discover that the heart may know what the head hasn't yet learned.

In recent years the problem of military suicides has reached epidemic proportions, but it's all too easy for most of us to gloss over the headlines or tune out the details. In The Last and Greatest Battle--the first book devoted exclusively to the problem of military suicides--John Bateson brings this neglected crisis into the spotlight. Bateson, the former executive director of a nationally certified suicide prevention center, surveys the history of suicide in the United States military from the Civil War to the present day and outlines a plan to save lives-and ultimately end the tragedy of military suicides. He uses the stories of individual soldiers to illuminate the unique challenges faced by American troops today. Transitioning from the front lines to the home front is difficult for many service members, and many need help both during and after their deployments. But even though the military is spending millions of dollars on suicide prevention programs, record numbers of soldiers continue to take their lives. To that end, Bateson outlines a plan of action. If the military works to remove stigma, to make treatment more effective and more accessible, and to limit risk factors for suicide in the first place by taking measures like reducing the number and length of deployments and adjusting pre-deployment training to take into account the way that wars are waged today, an end to the problem of military suicide is as possible as it is essential""--  ""In The Last and Greatest Battle--the first book devoted exclusively to the problem of military suicides--John Bateson brings this neglected crisis into the spotlight""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These systems rely on seemingly separate operations in order to continue common violent projects of segregation, confinement, removal, the application of harm to the physical body and the identification of people as inherently dehumanized. The practices and technologies of evaluation and decision making used by professionals, police, lawyers and experts are questioned in this book for their participation in the perpetuation of historical forms of colonial violence through the enforcement of racial and eugenic policies and laws in Canada""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Handbook of health psychology,Andrew Baum,psychology,First published in 2012,/works/OL16240340W,/authors/OL539306A/Andrew_Baum,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Psychology Press|Language English,"""Considered the most comprehensive handbook in the field, this new edition reviews the latest approaches to the most critical topics in health psychology today. This edition maintains the bio-psycho-social model framework. It cuts across concepts (e.g., behavior change), populations (e.g. women's health), risk and protective factors (e.g., obesity) and diseases, making it appropriate for a variety of readers from various fields.The contributors include the top researchers and rising stars in field. Each author provides a theoretical foundation, evaluates the empirical evidence, and makes suggestions for future research, clinical practice, and/or policy. Novices to the field appreciate the accessibly written chapters, while seasoned professionals appreciate the books deep, cutting edge coverage. The second edition reflects the enormous progress that has been made in the connections among the bio-psycho-social components of health, behavior, and illness. This model has been expanded across several levels of analysis, including cultural, macro-social, and cellular factors. The 2nd edition also features:Greater emphasis on translating research into practice and policy. Two new sections on risk and protective factors for disease and another on social and structural influences that affect health such as socioeconomic status, reflect the current scholarship in the field.More on prevention and/or interventions and treatment in the applications section. The book opens with the fields central theories including a ""newer"" stress theory that emphasizes the interaction of biological and social systems. Part 2 reviews the mechanisms that help us explain the link between health and behavior across diseases and populations. The all new Part 3 focuses on variables that lead to the onset and progression of major diseases or that are instrumental in promoting health. These factors can be behavioral (e.g., smoking, exercise), psychological (e.g., personality, depression) or a combination of the two (e.g., obesity). Part 4, also new to the 2nd edition, highlights the social and structural influences on health. The book concludes with applications of research to specific disorders. The handbook serves as a text in graduate and/or upper level undergraduate courses in health psychology taught in a variety of departments including psychology, public health, medical sociology, medicine, nursing, and other social and allied health sciences. Because of its comprehensive and current coverage, it also appeals to researchers and practitioners in these fields""--  ""Preface Since the publication of the first edition of the Handbook of Health Psychology (Psychology Press, 2001), enormous progress has been made in the connections among biological, psychological, and social components of health, health behavior, and illness. More important, scholars in the fi eld have expanded this tripartite model across even more levels of analysis, including cultural and macrosocial factors at one end and cellular factors at the other. Moreover, a new emphasis has been to translate research evidence in to practice and policy. The second edition of the handbook refl ects these changes and is quite different from the fi rst in terms of both approach and content. The 34 chapters are written by some of the top scholars in health psychology. Each author has taken seriously the task of providing a theoretical foundation, synthesizing and evaluating the empirical evidence, and contemplating how the state of the science can inform future research, clinical practice, and/or policy. The book maintains the fi rst edition's framework of the biopsychosocial model, but the choice of topics refl ects the advances that have been made in the fi eld over the past quarter century. Specifi cally, this new edition adds sections on risk and protective factors for disease and on macro-level factors that affect health. We believe that this structure more closely refl ects current scholarship in health psychology. The fi rst section, ""Overarching Frameworks and Paradigms,"" presents the central theories that inform many areas of research within the fi eld. For example, the concept of allostatic load is a ""newer"" stress theory that emphasizes the interaction of biological and social systems and may explain the onset of many conditions""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The CCTDI examined the disposition toward critical thinking for seven factors, Truth-seeking, Open-mindedness, Analyticity, Systematicity, Confidence, Inquisitiveness, and Maturity. The participants were 499 male and female undergraduate students at a public university in the mid-Atlantic states. All participants were surveyed using a demographic instrument and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), administered in classes with permission of professors.  Differences were found among majors on overall disposition toward critical thinking in Truth-seeking, Open-mindedness, Confidence, Inquisitiveness, and Maturity. Using GPA as a covariate, factorial MANCOVAs found differences for gender on Open-mindedness and Maturity, and differences across majors in Truth-seeking, Open-mindedness, Confidence, Inquisitiveness, and Maturity. A principal components confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the CCTDI had high stability for gender for two factors, moderate stability for two additional factors, and no stability for the remaining three factors. Stability for major was found for one factor. Item loadings on factors in this study contained combinations of factors originally defined by Facione. Two factors were renamed. Additional results indicated that highest-eventual-degree, gender, and major were the variables explaining the most variance for critical thinking disposition. Highest-eventual-degree had a unique influence on the scores for critical thinking disposition. The data strongly suggest that the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory was capable of discerning differences among different majors and genders. The data further suggested that the instrument was partially stable for gender and across majors, but further research is needed to replace unstable construct combinations which are built into some items of this instrument.

From a speakeasy whorehouse in the bottoms of Alabama to a luxurious high-rise apartment in Kenya, acclaimed author Tracy Price-Thompson crosses boundaries of sexuality, gender, and culture to accentuate the core of black identity: the enormous strength of family.""Ain't nothing like a Black man. No other man on the face of the earth can hold a light up to him, coming or going. Why do you think women are all the time chasing behind them? Smooth game and all, when a brotha loves you, he loves you right.""--from A Woman's WorthAbeni Omorru is a stunning Kenyan woman who is haunted by piercing memories. Although her father's wealth ensures her a life of prestige, childhood trauma has left her emotionally damaged and sexually promiscuous. While Abeni takes on many lovers, none come close to healing the wounds of her heart--and only a man who understands her worth can truly claim her soul. Bishop Johnson is also haunted by his past. Raised by prostitutes in a rural Alabama town, he is a promising teenage boxer--until his dreams are shattered when his parents are murdered during a violent robbery and he takes revenge on the perpetrators. Bishop goes to jail, and when he is released he has a volatile temper and a mean left hook to back it up. Trouble continues to find Bishop, and he is forced to leave Alabama and travel to Kenya with the Peace Corps. There he falls in love with Abeni, and they marry. When Bishop learns the secret of Abeni's past, he is force to make a decision that may cost him more than one man should ever have to sacrifice.From the Hardcover edition.

Their past, too traumatic to be remembered regularly is forgotten by everyone, save one—the historian. This demanding role has been bestowed on Yetu.  Yetu remembers for everyone, and the memories, painful and wonderful, traumatic and terrible and miraculous, are destroying her. And so, she flees to the surface escaping the memories, the expectations, and the responsibilities—and discovers a world her people left behind long ago.  Yetu will learn more than she ever expected about her own past—and about the future of her people. If they are all to survive, they’ll need to reclaim the memories, reclaim their identity—and own who they really are.   Read more Read less",43 Want to read|0 Currently reading|9 Have read

Now, in Girls Gone Mild, the brilliantly outspoken author investigates an emerging new movement. Despite nearly-naked teen models posing seductively to sell us practically everything, and the proliferation of homemade sex tapes as star-making vehicles, a youth-led rebellion is already changing course.In Seattle and Pittsburgh, teenage girls protest against companies that sell sleazy clothing. Online, a nineteen-year-old describes her struggles with her mother, who she feels is pressuring her to lose her virginity. In a small town outside Philadelphia, an eleventh-grade girl, upset over a ""dirty book"" read aloud in English class, takes her case to the school board.  These are not your mother's rebels.In an age where pornography is mainstream, teen clothing seems stripper-patented, and ""experts"" recommend that we learn to be emotionally detached about sex, a key (and callously) targeted audience--girls--is fed up. Drawing on numerous studies and interviews, Shalit makes the case that today's virulent ""bad girl"" mindset most truly oppresses young women. Nowadays, as even the youngest teenage girls feel the pressure to become cold sex sirens, put their bodies on public display, and suppress their feelings in order to feel accepted and (temporarily) loved, many young women are realizing that ""friends with benefits"" are often anything but. And as these girls speak for themselves, we see that what is expected of them turns out to be very different from what is in their own hearts.Shalit reveals how the media, one's peers, and even parents can undermine girls' quests for their authentic selves, details the problems of sex without intimacy, and explains what it means to break from the herd mentality and choose integrity over popularity. Written with sincerity and upbeat humor, Girls Gone Mild rescues the good girl from the realm of mythology and old manners guides to show that today's version is the real rebel: She is not ""people pleasing"" or repressed; she is simply reclaiming her individuality. These empowering stories are sure to be an inspiration to teenagers and parents alike.Reviews:""Here we are, decades after the feminist revolution, and yet crude self-display -- of a kind that makes the daring of the 1960s seem quaint -- is considered something that a ""normal"" college girl might eagerly choose to do for a stranger with a camera and a release form. What is going on? ""We continually malign the good girl as 'repressed,'"" notes Wendy Shalit, ""while the bad girl is (wrongly) perceived as intrinsically expressing her individuality and somehow proving her sexuality.""Wall Street Journal, reviewed by Pia Catton""What makes the [Girls Gone Mild] movement unique, according to Shalit, is that it's the adults who are often pushing sexual boundaries, and the kids who are slamming on the brakes. ""Well-meaning experts and parents say that they understand kids' wanting to be 'bad' instead of 'good',"" she writes in her book. ""Yet this reversal of adults' expectations is often experienced not as a gift of freedom but a new kind of oppression."" Which just may prove that rebelling against Mom and Dad is one trend that will never go out of style.""Newsweek, reviewed by Jennie Yabroff ""The culture has not yet carved out a space for women to indulge their own fantasies rather than to fulfill those of men. Feminism has not finished its job; a version of nonmushy,...   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Therese Wolley is a mother who has made a promise. She works as a secretary, shops for groceries on Saturdays, and takes care of her two girls. She doesn't dwell on the fact that her girls are fatherless, mostly because her own father abandoned her before she was born and she has done just fine without him. Even though her older daughter regularly wakes with nightmares and her younger one whispers letters under her breath, she doesn't shift from her resolve that everything will be fine. She promises . . . and they believe. Until the morning an obituary in the newspaper changes everything. Therese immediately knows what she has to do. She cannot delay what she has planned, and she cannot find the words to explain her heartbreaking decision to her daughters. She considers her responsibilities, her girls, and her promise. Then she does the only thing that any real mother would do. She goes on the run with one daughter . . . and abandons the other.

Reinventing Racism: Why “White Fragility” Is the Wrong Way to Think About Racial Inequality,Jonathan D.

White fragility is defined as an unwillingness on the part of white people to engage in the difficult conversations necessary to address racial inequality. This “fragility” allegedly undermines the fight against racial inequality.  Despite its wide acclaim and rapid acceptance, the theory of white fragility has received no serious and sustained scrutiny. This book argues that the theory is flawed on numerous fronts. The theory functions as a divisive rhetorical device to shut down debate. It relies on the flawed premise of implicit bias. It posits a faulty way of understanding racism. It has serious methodological problems. It conflates objectivity and neutrality. It exploits narrative at the expense of facts. It distorts many of the ideas upon which the theory relies.  This book also offers a more constructive way to think about Whiteness, white privilege, and “white fragility,” pointing us to a more promising vision for addressing racial inequality.

Facing incomprehensible circumstances, Claire must learn to survive her new reality--every aspect of her livelihood depends upon the tall, dark-eyed tycoon who is a true master of deception. Driven by unknown demons, he has no tolerance for imperfection, in any aspect of his life, including his recent acquisition. Anthony may appear to the world as a handsome, benevolent businessman, but in reality Claire knows firsthand that he's a menacing, controlling captor with very strict rules: do as you're told, public failure is not an option, and appearances are of the utmost importance.  Captivate the captor.  To fit together the pieces of the puzzle, Claire must follow his rules. Will her plan work, or will Anthony become enthralled by Claire's beauty, resilience, and determination, changing the game forever? If that happens, will either of them survive the consequences?  Nobody ever did or ever will escape the consequences of his choices.--Alfred A. Montapert   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

But it was not until her daughters placed a personal ad in a literary journal that Roiphe began to consider the previously unimagined possibility of a new man. Moving between heartbreaking memories of her marriage and the pressing needs of a new day-to-day routine, Epilogue takes us on her journey into the unknown world of life after love.Roiphe decides to reenter the dating world. But between new lunches, coffee dates, and e-mail exchanges, she wrestles with an unsettling loneliness. Recollections of marriage evoke complex, unexpected emotions on her journey through grief toward new companionship. In beautifully wrought vignettes, she recalls hailing a cab for the first time and learning to lock and unlock the front door—tasks her husband had always done.Eloquent and astute, Epilogue tells the story of love rekindled and life remade. Roiphe offers us an elegant literary pastiche not of grief, but of hope and renewal.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this impassioned dialogue our country's most distinguished pediatrician and most influential child psychiatrist define what every child must have in the first years of life. Cutting through the theories, platitudes, and controversies that abound in childcare advice, the authors, both famed advocates for children, lay out the seven irreducible needs of any child, in any society, They confront the hard questions: Are parents in America and other countries spending enough time with their children? What is the basic time requirement? What is the effect of full-time day care on infants and toddlers? What is the impact of shifting caregivers, of foster care, and of custody and adoption arrangements? Nothing is off limits, even whether or not most children can learn in today's public schools and whether environmental hazards are undermining their healthy growth and development. This short, hard-hitting book, the fruit of decades of experience and caring, sounds a wake-up call for parents, teachers, judges, political leaders -- anyone who cares about the future of children and, therefore, society.

When the need to learn about how executives and customer think is recognized, a solution is usually implemented automatically, with no thought given to the relative worth of alternative methods to learn fill the need. Thus, the ""dominant logics"" (most often implemented methods) to learn about thinking are written surveys and focus group interviews--two research methods that that almost always fail to provide valid and useful answers on how and why executives and customers think the way they do. Through descriptive research, MDT examines the actual thinking and actions by executives and customers related to making marketplace decisions. The book aims to achieve three objectives:Increase the reader's knowledge of the unconscious and conscious thinking processes of participants marketplace contextsProvide research tools useful for revealing the unconscious and conscious thinking processes of executives and customersProvide in-depth examples of these research tools in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contextsThis book asks how we actually go about thinking, examining this process and its influences within the context of B2B and B2C marketplaces in developed nations.

She also addresses: - How environment is still important and influences behaviors - The characteristics of people at high risk for developing anorexia nervosa - Why anorexics find starvation ""rewarding"" - Why denial is such a salient feature, and how sufferers can overcome it Carrie also includes interviews with key figures in the field that explains their work and how it contributes to our understanding of anorexia.

"""Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?""",Beverly Daniel Tatum,psychology,First published in 1999,/works/OL2683671W?edition=ia%3Awhyareallblackki00tatu,/authors/OL391874A/Beverly_Daniel_Tatum,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6804394M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1998|Publisher  BasicBooks|Language English|Pages 270,"There is a moment when every child leaves color-blindness behind & enters the world of race consciousness. At that moment, there are two roads parents, educators, & therapists can take: they can follow the status quo, internalizing racial expectations, & become-consciously or unconsciously-part of the problem. Or, they can question stereotypes, &, actively work against racism to become part of the solution. This book provides the tools we all need to become part of the solution. Beginning with racial segregation in an integrated school situation, this book explores race relations & the development of racial identity from many different viewpoints.  Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see black youth seated together in the cafeteria. Of course, it's not just the black kids sitting together-the white, Latino, Asian Pacific, and, in some regions, American Indian youth are clustered in their own groups, too. The same phenomenon can be observed in college dining halls, faculty lounges, and corporate cafeterias. What is going on here? Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about all the other questions we and our children have about race? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, asserts that we do not know how to talk about our racial differences: Whites are afraid of using the wrong words and being perceived as ""racist"" while parents of color are afraid of exposing their children to painful racial realities too soon. Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities-whatever they may be-is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides. We have waited far too long to begin our conversations about race. This remarkable book, infused with great wisdom and humanity, has already helped hundreds of thousands of readers figure out where to start. -- Publisher.

Lonely for her father and petrified for her mother's safety, Arden dreads her trip to the house in Sardinia--the only place that has truly felt like home to her. So when she meets a group of fun, carefree, and careless friends on their summer break, she decides to put off her trip and join them to sample the sights and culinary delights of Europe. Soon they are climbing the Eiffel Tower, taking in the French countryside on a train chugging toward the Alps, and gazing at Michelangelo's David in Florence, all the while eating gelato and sipping cappuccino. Arden tries to forget about the danger her mom faces every day, to pretend she's just like the rest of the girls, flirting with cute European guys and worried only about where to party next. But the house in Sardinia beckons and she has to make a choice. Is Arden ready to jump off the high dive?From the Hardcover edition.

She examines the final days of five great writers and artists. Here is Susan Sontag, the ultimate intellectual, finding her commitment to rational thinking tested during her third bout with cancer. Here is Sigmund Freud fleeing Nazi-occupied Vienna for London only to continue the constant cigar-smoking that he knows will soon kill him. Roiphe takes us to the hospital room where, after receiving the worst kind of diagnosis, seventy-six year old John Updike immediately begins writing a poem. She vividly portrays Dylan Thomas's extraordinary self-destructive tendencies that culminate in his infamous final collapse at a Greenwich Village tavern. And she shows us how Maurice Sendak's beloved books for children are infused with his lifelong obsession with death, if you know where to look. In each of these glorious creators' final moments, Roiphe finds bravery, suffering, bad behavior, passionate love, peacefulness, bursts of energy, and profound thinking. In a voice that is unsentimental, compassionate, urgent, Roiphe helps us to look boldly at death and be less afraid""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Richerson and Boyd illustrate here that culture is neither superorganic nor the handmaiden of the genes. Rather, it is essential to human adaptation, as much a part of human biology as bipedal locomotion. Drawing on work in the fields of anthropology, political science, sociology, and economics - and building their case with such examples as kayaks, corporations, clever knots, and yams that require twelve men to carry them - Richerson and Boyd demonstrate that culture and biology are inextricably linked, and they show us how to think about their interaction in a way that yields a richer understanding of human nature.""--Jacket.

In the flicker between remembrance and forgetting, she recalls an enigmatic grandfather who came back from war a different man; the night her cousin Rosmarie fell through the conservatory roof and shattered her family's lives; and a moment of love that made all the trees in the orchard bloom overnight ...

Then, in one instant, Sara is thrust into a frantic police investigation, coming face-to-face with a tall driven detective and his quiet female partner.... In Undone, three unforgettable characters from Karin Slaughter's New York Times bestselling novels Faithless and Fractured collide for the first time, entering an electrifying race against the clock--and a duel with unspeakable human evil.In the backwoods of suburban Atlanta, where Sara's patient was found, local police have set up their investigation. But Georgia Bureau of Investigation detective Will Trent doesn't wait for the go-ahead from his boss--he plunges through police lines, through the brooding woods, and single-handedly exposes a hidden house of horror buried beneath the earth. Then he finds another victim.... Wresting the case away from the local police chief, Will and his partner, Faith Mitchell--a woman keeping explosive secrets of her own--are called into a related investigation. Another woman--a smart, upscale, independent young mother--has been snatched. For the two cops out on the hunt, for the doctor trying to bring her patient back to life, the truth hits like a hammer: the killer's torture chamber has been found, but the killer is still at work.In her latest suspense masterpiece, Karin Slaughter weaves together the moving, powerful human stories of characters as real as they are complex and unforgettable. At the same time she has crafted a work of dazzling storytelling and spine-tingling mystery--as three people, each with their own wounds and their own secrets, are all that stands between a madman and his next crime.From the Hardcover edition.

Tarcher/Penguin|Language English,"This collection of original essays by women in their thirties celebrates this often maligned period in a woman's life as, in fact, a productive, dynamic, and vibrant time of self-invention and personal and professional creativityIf recent bestsellers such as The Bitch in the House and Midlife Crisis at Thirty serve as any indication of how women are experiencing their thirties, who can blame women embarking upon this decade in their life for panicking? Yet, as the contributors to this thoughtful and inspiring book attest, it doesn't have to be so scary.In The May Queen, a wide array of women-including bestselling author Jennifer Weiner and star of the hit independent film Kissing Jessica Stein Heather Juergensen-describe the conflicting emotions they've felt in response to the ""anything is possible"" message women of their generation receive. And yet, all of the women featured in this book have found their thirties to be a time of great opportunity-a period in their lives in which they're taking the time to consider what they have lost, what they have gained, and what they still need to learn. This book gives a powerful voice to a new generation of women beginning to make its mark on the world.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Attempts to reduce death anxiety and the possibility of denial of mortality-relevant information interact with intertemporal choices and may lead to time-inconsistent behavior and other ""behavioral"" phenomena.  In the model, repression of signals of mortality leads to underconsumption for unsophisticated individuals, but forward-sophisticated individuals may over-consume in anticipation of future denial and may seek ways to commit to act according to one's mortality prospects as currently perceived.  We show that the mere possibility of engaging in this kind of denial leads to time-inconsistent but efficient behavior.  Refusal to face up to the reality of death may help explain a wide range of empirical phenomena, including the underutilization of tax-advanced inter vivos gifts and inadequate purchase of life insurance""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

But once he's met the enigmatic Simone, Harry is intrigued.  Just what did happen to Simone's twin sister who disappeared without trace several years before? And what is the Anderson sisters' connection to another set of twin girls, Viola and Sorrel Quinton, born in London on 1st January 1900?  All Harry's lines of enquiry seem to lead to the small Shropshire village of Weston Fferna and the imposing ruin of Mortmain House, standing grim and forbidding on the Welsh borders.  As Harry delves into the violent and terrible history of Mortmain, in an attempt to uncover what happened to Simone and Sonia and, a century before them, to Viola and Sorrel Quinton, he finds himself drawn into a number of interlocking mysteries, each one more puzzling -- and sinister -- than the last.

In Critiques of Everyday Life Michael Gardiner proposes that there exists a counter-tradition within everyday life theorising. This counter-tradition has sought not merely to describe lived experience, but to transform it by elevating our understanding of the everyday to the status of a critical knowledge.In his analysis Gardiner engages with the work of a number of significant theorists and approaches that have been marginalized by mainstream academe, including:The French tradition of everyday life theorising, from the surrealists to Henri Lefebvre, and from the Situationist International to Michel de CerteauAgnes Heller and the relationship between the everyday, rationality and ethicsCarnival, prosaics and intersubjectivity in the work of Mikhail BakhtinDorothy E. Smith's feminist perspective on everyday life.Critiques of Everyday Life demonstrates the importance of an alternative, multidisciplinary everyday life paradigm and offers a myriad of new possibilities for critical social and cultural theorising and empirical research.

Franck|Language French,"The Guide for the Perplexed (Hebrew:מורה נבוכים, translit. Moreh Nevukhim, Arabic: ‎dalālatul ḥā’irīn דלאל̈ה אלחאירין دلالة الحائرين) is one of the major works of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, better known as Maimonides or ""the Rambam"". It was written in the 12th century in the form of a three-volume letter to his student, Rabbi Joseph ben Judah of Ceuta, the son of Rabbi Judah, and is the main source of the Rambam's philosophical views, as opposed to his opinions on Jewish law.  Since many of the philosophical concepts, such as his view of theodicy and the relationship between philosophy and religion, are relevant beyond strictly Jewish theology, it has been the work most commonly associated with Maimonides in the non-Jewish world and it is known to have influenced several major non-Jewish philosophers. Following its publication, ""almost every philosophic work for the remainder of the Middle Ages cited, commented on, or criticized Maimonides' views."" Within Judaism, the Guide became widely popular, with many Jewish communities requesting copies of the manuscript, but also quite controversial, with some communities limiting its study or banning it altogether.

An answer to this critical theological problem is found within these pages.  ""If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain?"" And what about the suffering of animals, who neither deserve pain nor can be improved by it? The greatest Christian thinker of our time sets out to disentangle these knotty issues.

Through dialogue, three fictional characters named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of God's existence. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.  In the Dialogues, Hume's characters debate a number of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the argument from design -- for which Hume uses the example of a house -- and whether there is more suffering or good in the world.

Told by her pastor, Legh Richmond, it's the story of young Elizabeth Wallbridge, who came to be known as ""The Dairyman's Daughter.""  A child of a poor dairy farmer in England, Richmond met Elizabeth in 1798 upon his arrival as the new minister on the Isle of Wight. He learned from her of a proud past in which she forsook all love of her family, but then of the sweet love of Christ which was formed in her and the shining testimony she became as a witness for Him with her holy life. Richmond regarded Elizabeth as ""one of the best-versed persons in the Scriptures"" whom he had ever met and considered meeting her one of the highest privileges of his life.

Bles|Language English|Pages 159,"In his classic book The Four Loves, Lewis describes the four basic kinds of human love-affection, friendship, erotic love, and the love of God. Since this is the only commercial recording of C. S. Lewis that is available today, fans of his writing will desire to add this impressive recording to their collection. While Lewis's writings have impacted more evangelical Christians than perhaps any other writer, this audio product of the author's reading of this classic book will undoubtedly expand the theological understanding of the nature of love to a much wider audience. He explores the love between parents and children, the love of friends, the love of men and women for each other, and the love of God that may enrich all love. He also goes in-depth into questions of sex, possessiveness, jealousy, pride, false sentimentality, manners in loving, and the need for more laughter between lovers. Lewis's wise and candid reflections on the virtues and dangers of love draw on sources from Jane Austen to Saint Augustine. This recording features a new audio introduction and commentary by Chuck Colson. The CD will also include a study guide--perfect for individual or group use. - Publisher.

In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds-two men, two faiths, two communities-that will inspire readers everywhere.Albom's first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor-a reformed drug dealer and convict-who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat.As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds-and indeed, between beliefs everywhere.In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself.Have a Little Faith is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story. Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.

He was the first Professor of Anthropology at the University of Oxford from 1896 to 1909, and developed a broad definition of culture  which is still used by scholars. First published in 1871, this classic work explains Tylor's idea of cultural  evolution in relation to anthropology, a social theory which states that human cultures  invariably change over time to become more complex. Unlike his contemporaries, Tylor did not link biological evolution to cultural  evolution, asserting that all human minds are the same irrespective of a society's state of evolution.

De consolatione philosophiae,Boethius,religion,First published in 1476,/works/OL10509459W,/authors/OL143103A/Boethius,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22164487M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1984|Publisher  Eldonejo Kardo|Language Esperanto|Pages 146,"Ancinus Boethius (ca. 480-524 AD) came from a politically connected family. He was a Roman senator by the age of 25, eventually becoming a Consul, as was his father and eventually both of his sons. Although these roles were political, he was primarily a philosopher who valued principle. Perhaps it was inevitable that he would fall out on the wrong side of a political issue. About 524, he was arrested for treason, stripped of all of his property and imprisoned in exile in Pavia, knowing that he would eventually be killed. He claimed that evidence against him was fabricated and he was innocent; there is no way to know now.  While he was in prison, Boethius wrote this book.  In this allegorical prose and verse conversation between himself and the character of Philosophy, the author looks clearly at the coincidences and vagaries of fortune, the meaning of happiness, the aspects of free will, and the roles of good and evil. He uses Philosophy's instruction to comfort and enlighten him, a philosopher to the end.  In 524 or 525 AD, Boethius was tortured and bludgeoned to death. He died that day, but the wealth he left in Consolation of Philosophy is timeless. Rich in references to many classical scholars, this book was a staple of medieval Europe's study, and underpins later works by Dante and Chaucer.  So why read an old book like this now? Life is hard, bad things happen, the veneer of civilization is thin. Instead of resorting to bitterness in his imprisonment, instead of retreating into the role of falsely accused victim, Boethius spent his condemned days writing what is perhaps the greatest work about the persistent nobility of the human spirit.  This book is an inspiration that pays tribute to every wounded human who still gets up in the morning, puts on both socks and shoes and does his or her best to live, to heal, to survive, to thrive. Consolation of Philosophy opens a window of awe into the persistence and reach of the human spirit in a way that has everything to do with inspiration and nothing to do with religion.  This should be required reading for every health care practitioner, every police officer, every attorney, every social worker, anyone whose work requires the recounting of suffering on a daily basis.  Socrates said, ""The unexamined life is not worth living."" The corollary to that is: the examined life of a sentient human is not for the faint of heart. This book arms each sentient human with tools that allow the examined life for self and others.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

François is bored. He’s a middle-aged lecturer at the New Sorbonne University and an expert on J. K. Huysmans, the famed nineteenth-century novelist associated with the Decadent movement. But François’s own decadence is of considerably smaller scale. He sleeps with his students, eats microwave dinners, and watches YouPorn.  Meanwhile, it’s election season, and in an alliance with the Socialists, France’s new Islamic party sweeps to power―and Islamic law is instituted. Women are veiled, polygamy is encouraged, and François is offered an irresistible academic advancement―on the condition that he converts to Islam.  A darkly comic masterpiece from one of France’s great writers, Submission by Michel Houellebecq has become an international sensation and one of the most discussed novels of our time.

True, they have no literature, no fine arts, and don't understand the concept of recreation, but neither do they understand the concepts of greed, envy, lust, or any of the sins and vices that plague humankind. Their world seems darned near perfect. And that is just what disturbs the good Father.  First published in 1959, James Blish's Hugo Award-winning A Case of Conscience is science fiction at its very best: a fast-paced, intelligent story that offers plenty of action while at the same time explores complex questions of values and ethics. In this case, Blish has taken on the age-old battle of good vs. evil. Lithia poses a theological question that lies at the heart of this book: is God necessary for a moral society? The Lithians are nothing if not moral. Not only do they lack the seven deadly sins, they also lack original sin. And without any sort of religious framework, they have created the Christian ideal world, one that humans would be eager to study and emulate. But is it too perfect? Is it in fact, as Father Ruiz-Sanchez suspects, the work of The Adversary? And what role does Egtverchi, the young Lithian raised on Earth, play? Is he an innocent victim of circumstance, or will he bring about the Dies Irae, the day of the wrath of God, upon the earth? The fate of two worlds hinges on the answers to these questions, and will lead to an ancient earth heresy that shakes the Jesuit priest's beliefs to their very core.  A Case of Conscience is a brilliant piece of storytelling, and it packs a lot into a scant 242 pages. Most readers will probably finish the book in one sitting, unable to stop until the spectacular denouement. But the questions posed by this little-known gem will stay with you for days afterward. --P.M. Atterberry   Read more Read less",15 Want to read|2 Currently reading|9 Have read

Bush has proclaimed, have a special mission, derived from God, to bring liberty and democracy to the world? How much influence does the Christian right have over U.S. foreign policy? And how should America deal with violent Islamist extremists? Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state and bestselling author of Madam Secretary, offers a thoughtful and often surprising look at the role of religion in shaping America's approach to the world. Drawing upon her experiences while in office and her own deepest beliefs about morality, the United States, and the present state of world affairs, a woman noted for plain speaking offers her thoughts about the most controversial topics of our time. In The Mighty and the Almighty, Madeleine Albright examines the profound impact of religion on America's view of itself, the effect on U.S. policy of the rise of the Christian right, the Bush administration's successes and failures in responding to 9/11, the challenges posed by the war in Iraq, and the importance of understanding Islam. She offers a balanced but, when necessary, devastating analysis of U.S. strategy and condemns those of all faiths who exploit religious fervor to create divisions or enhance their own power. In this illuminating account, Albright argues that, to be effective, U.S. policy-makers must understand the power and place of religion in motivating others and in coloring how American actions are perceived. Defying the conventional wisdom, she suggests not only that religion and politics are inseparable, but that their partnership, when properly harnessed, can be a force for justice and peace.

First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time.In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today.With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of ""Christianities"" emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment--and access to God--within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary--or worthy--expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed--and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.

Haunted by the crimes in which he had participated, the soldier wanted to confess to--and obtain absolution from--a Jew. Faced with the choice between compassion and justice, silence and truth, Wiesenthal said nothing.  But even years after the way had ended, he wondered: Had he done the right thing? What would you have done in his place?In this important book, fifty-three distinguished men and women respond to Wiesenthal's questions. They are theologians, political leaders, writers, jurists, psychiatrists, human rights activists, Holocaust survivors, and victims of attempted genocides in Bosnia, Cambodia, China and Tibet. Their responses, as varied as their experiences of the world, remind us that Wiesenthal's questions are not limited to events of the past.  Often surprising and always thought provoking, The Sunflower will challenge you to define your beliefs about justice, compassion, and human responsibility.From the Trade Paperback edition.

The religion of the ancient Celts,John Arnott MacCulloch,religion,First published in 1911,/works/OL107053W?edition=ia%3Areligionofancien00macc,/authors/OL18101A/John_Arnott_MacCulloch,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL176204M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1911|Publisher  T. & T. Clark|Language English|Pages 399,"To summon a dead religion from its forgotten grave and to make it tell its story, would require an enchanter's wand. Other old faiths, of Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Rome, are known to us. But in their case liturgies, myths, theogonies, theologies, and the accessories of cult, remain to yield their report of the outward form of human belief and aspiration. How scanty, on the other hand, are the records of Celtic religion! The bygone faith of a people who have inspired the world with noble dreams must be constructed painfully, and often in fear and trembling, out of fragmentary and, in many cases, transformed remains.We have the surface observations of classical observers, dedications in the Romano-Celtic area to gods mostly assimilated to the gods of the conquerors, figured monuments mainly of the same period, coins, symbols, place and personal names. For the Irish Celts there is a mass of written material found mainly in eleventh and twelfth century MSS. Much of this, in spite of alteration and excision, is based on divine and heroic myths, and it also contains occasional notices of ritual. From Wales come documents like the Mabinogion, and strange poems the personages of which are ancient gods transformed, but which tell nothing of rite or cult. Valuable hints are furnished by early ecclesiastical documents, but more important is existing folk-custom, which preserves so much of the old cult, though it has lost its meaning to those who now use it. Folk-tales may also be inquired of, if we discriminate between what in them is Celtic and what is universal. Lastly, Celtic burial-mounds and other remains yield their testimony to ancient belief and custom.From these sources we try to rebuild Celtic paganism and to guess at its inner spirit, though we are working in the twilight on a heap of fragments. No Celt has left us a record of his faith and practice, and the unwritten poems of the Druids died with them. Yet from these fragments we see the Celt as the seeker after God, linking himself by strong ties to the unseen, and eager to conquer the unknown by religious rite or magic art. For the things of the spirit have never appealed in vain to the Celtic soul, and long ago classical observers were struck with the religiosity of the Celts. They neither forgot nor transgressed the law of the gods, and they thought that no good befell men apart from their will. The submission of the Celts to the Druids shows how they welcomed authority in matters of religion, and all Celtic regions have been characterised by religious devotion, easily passing over to superstition, and by loyalty to ideals and lost causes. The Celts were born dreamers, as their exquisite Elysium belief will show, and much that is spiritual and romantic in more than one European literature is due to them.

The expedition of the Donner party and its tragic fate,Eliza Poor Donner Houghton,religion,First published in 1911,/works/OL2688903W?edition=ia%3Aexpeditionofdonn0000houg,/authors/OL392819A/Eliza_Poor_Donner_Houghton,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23093600M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  A.C. McClurg|Language English|Pages 374,"The Donner Party is one of the most famous emigrant adventures in American history.  Eliza Donner Houghton compassionately and accurately recounts this well-known journey and its aftermath.  Her narrative is compelling both as story and as history.  She combines her childhood recollections of life on the ill-fated wagon train with other survivors' accounts and historical sources.   First published in 1911, her work remains one of the premier histories of the Donner Party.    Thirty-two members of the Donner Party left Springfield, Illinois, in April 1846, unknowledgeable and unprepared in for the obstacles they would face.  En route to California the group increased to 81.  After numerous delays, often due to supposed ""shortcuts,"" the party unsuccessfully attempted to cross the Sierra Nevada late in the fall of 1846.  Winter storms trapped the already weary travelers in the mountains for four months.  Forty-two people succumbed to cold and starvation before relief from California reached the stranded emigrants.    Numerous historians have retold the misfortunes of the Donner Party.  This book is a basic source of information about those events because of Eliza Donner Houghton's personal experience.  Mrs. Houghton does not spare the reader from the horrors and sufferings of the party.  But unlike other records of the events, her account also shares the joys and romance of the overland journey, as well as describing her life in California after the tragedy.  Her parents perished  in the mountains, but she and her sisters were adopted by Mary and Christian Brunner.  She reminds us that the survivors of the Donner Party were not doomed for the remainder of their lives.  Once rescued, these people thrived in California, the land they endured so much to reach.  This new printing includes a foreword by William N. Lindemann, Curator of the Donner Memorial State Park, in the Sierra District of the California Department of Parks and Recreation.

From King David to Barack Obama, from the birth of Judaism, Christianity and Islam to the Israel-Palestine conflict, this is the epic history of three thousand years of faith, slaughter, fanaticism and coexistence. How did this small, remote town become the Holy City, the ""center of the world"" and now the key to peace in the Middle East? In a gripping narrative, Simon Sebag Montefiore reveals this ever-changing city in its many incarnations, bringing every epoch and character blazingly to life. Jerusalem's biography is told through the wars, love affairs and revelations of the men and women -- kings, empresses, prophets, poets, saints, conquerors and whores -- who created, destroyed, chronicled and believed in Jerusalem. As well as the many ordinary Jerusalemites who have left their mark on the city, its cast varies from Solomon, Saladin and Suleiman the Magnificent to Cleopatra, Caligula and Churchill; from Abraham to Jesus and Muhammad; from the ancient world of Jezebel, Nebuchadnezzar, Herod and Nero to the modern times of the Kaiser, Disraeli, Mark Twain, Lincoln, Rasputin, Lawrence of Arabia and Moshe Dayan. Drawing on new archives, current scholarship, his own family papers and a lifetime's study, Montefiore illuminates the essence of sanctity and mysticism, identity and empire in a unique chronicle of the city that many believe will be the setting for the Apocalypse. This is how Jerusalem became Jerusalem, and the only city that exists twice -- in heaven and on earth. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",18 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Smith received these golden plates from Mormon's son Moroni who was dead but considered glorified and resurrected on September 21, 1823. Smith said he was instructed by God to provide the rendering of these documents into the English language. This New Bible speaks of Jesus' appearance in America after His resurrection.

Cross,religion,First published in 1950,/works/OL6438269W?edition=ia%3Aburnedoverdistri00cros,/authors/OL1706559A/Whitney_R._Cross,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22338445M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1965|Publisher  Harper & Row|Language English|Pages 383,"This volume is an expansion of the author's Ph.D. thesis at Harvard, where he was a graduate-student compatriot of Arthur Schlesinger Jr., both mentored by Arthur Schlesinger Sr.  Dr. Cross grew up in Rochester, New York, and later was able to expand the book by virtue of being the curator of regional source materials at Cornell, during the Second World War--a college-age back injury caused him to be rejected for active military service.  However, he taught at the Navy Submarine School at Groten, CN, one of the war years.  The ""Burned-over District"" bore that name even at the time it existed, from the late 1820's to the late 1840's, because of its large and impassioned religious revivals, reported in news items nationwide.  The historical question was, ""Why had this phenomenon arisen in this locale, who participated, why, and what were the larger context and impacts?""  In pursuing these questions, Cross stumbled into being one of the first ""American social historians""; others in the discipline would shift their interests in that direction 15-20 years after publication of his work.  (His fellow student, A. S. Jr., focused on Andrew Jackson, and became famous for his ""Age of Jackson"".)  In the book Cross describes the many odd religious and communal (today we might say 'cult') groups that grew up in the area, and the great revivals that drew the rural population into urban centers during the parts of the summer when, for the most part, crops could be left to grow with minimal oversight.  He ascribed the atmosphere of experimentation and readiness to listen to new thinking, to the people of Western/Upstate New York's having left exhausted New England soils, their easier migration westward being facilitated by the new Erie Canal, and their settlement in a less-defined social and economic environment.  He used the Turner (Frontier) Thesis as his takeoff point, but from the vantage point of 2010, we can easily understand how rapid social change can disrupt old patterns and beliefs.  One significant point is that these groups, revivals, speakers, and leaders dealt in social and ethical ideas that were ""advanced"" and ""progressive"" for the times, and a number of individuals and groups later became strong advocates of Abolition, pushing for the value positions and reforms that increased tensions and pressure on the South, until Secession and the Civil War rent the nation.  One might say, although I don't know that Dr. Cross ever did, that ""Some of the seeds of war were sown in the Burned-over District thirty or more years previously.""  This work was notable in some other aspects as well.  Serious amateur historians in New York State still consider the book a prime guide to source materials, because of the author's care with citations, and explanations of what characterized, say, a given collection of letters or other group of documents, etc.  Of course, many of these materials now reside in the collections of Cornell University.  Secondly, an innovator may well be without honor in his own time.  This was an unusual focus of scholarship for the time, as noted (it might be called 'Sociological History'), and Dr. Cross failed to get tenure, repeatedly, in the lean days of Academia in the late 40's and early 50's. He was still an Assistant Professor at the University of West Virginia when felled by an abrupt heart attack at the age of 42, in 1955.  He had seen, however, that no one was ""getting"" social history yet, and had shifted his interests toward intellectual history (which often in the field accompanies social history), and the development of ideas in the area of resource development and conservation.  A ~1954 paper (?) in the Mississippi Valley Historical Review (Later the American Historical Review), proposed the identity of the man who ""invented"" the word and concept of ""conservation"", and got it growing within the small group of Theodore Roosevelt's resource-focused advisers (men like Gifford Pinchot).  This book is not the easiest reading, and has been criticized on the grounds that the author did not smoothly tie the incidents and groups he describes to his central thesis.  That, I think, can be explained both by the historian's awkward stance between facts and theory--the real stories vs. the ideal big idea which places all the facts tidily in their logical places, and the fact that Dr. Cross' mother was an early women's rights advocate and English teacher--when he laid out a paragraph there must have been a sense of his mother looking over his shoulder (and she was very alive at the time), afflicting him with some anxiety.  I have considered re-styling the book because I think I'm a better writer than my father was, but doubt that I will get around to it.  A picture will be forthcoming.                                                               --Peter R.

Words like ""judgment,"" ""faith,"" ""dogma,"" ""salvation,"" ""sinner""even ""Christ""formed what she called her ""scary vocabulary,"" words that had become so codified or abstract that their meanings were all but impenetrable. She found she had to wrestle with them and make them her own before they could confer their blessings and their grace. Blending history, theology, storytelling, etymology, and memoir, Norris uses these words as a starting point for reflection, and offers a moving account of her own gradual conversion. She evokes a rich spirituality rooted firmly in the chaos of everyday lifeand offers believers and doubters alike an illuminating perspective on how we can embrace ancient traditions and find faith in the contemporary world.

But at the very heart of this fracture is a fascinating rig and paradoxical marriage between our country's politics and religions.Over the past several election cycles, the differences between so-called ""Red America""—conservative, church-affiliated, suburban, and rural—and ""Blue America""—urban, secular, and socially liberal—have hardened. Although on most days, these two big American mainstreams move on parallel tracks, they increasingly find themselves head to head, ready to fight at the slightest offense. They react to new stories in different ways. They react to government power in different ways. They certainly vote in different ways.With The Holy Vote, Ray Suarez explores the advent of this polarization and how it is profoundly changing the way in which we live our lives. With hands-on reporting, Suarez explores the attitudes and beliefs of the people behind the voting numbers, the places in which these new beliefs are being born, and how the political divide is manifesting itself across the country. The reader will come to a greater understanding of how Americans believe, and how this belief structure fuels the debates that dominate the issues on our evening news.

For Fox, Jesus was ""no sentimental dreamer, no mere dealer in empty platitudes, but the unflinching realist that only a great mystic can be.""In his most popular work, Emmet Fox shows how to: Understand the true nature of divine wisdom. Tap into the power of prayer. Develop a completely integrated and fully expressed personality. Transform negative attitudes into life-affirming beliefs. Claim our divine right to the full abundance of life.   Read more Read less",14 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

If they were to meet on the road today, what would each think of the other's spiritual views and practices?  Thich Nhat Hanh has been part of a decades-long dialogue between the two greatest living contemplative traditions, and brings to Christianity an appreciation of its beauty that could only be conveyed by an outsider. In a lucid, meditative prose, he explores the crossroads of compassion and holiness at which the two traditions meet, and reawakens our understanding of both. ""On the altar in my hermitage,"" he says, ""are images of Buddha and Jesus, and . . . I touch both of them as my spiritual ancestors.""     >A rare combination of mystic, scholar, and activist, Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most beloved Buddhist teachers in the West.  ""[Thich Nhat Hanh] is a holy man, for he is humble and devout. . . .

Especially, the author desires to treat the literature of the social question and of the modernist movement with a fulness which has not been possible within the limits of this sketch. The philosophy of religion and the history of religions should have place, as also that estimate of the essence of Christianity which is suggested by the contact of Christianity with the living religions of the Orient.

Among the distinguished contributors are Avery Dulles, S.J., Archbishop Paul J. Hallinan, Robert McAfee Brown, John Courtney Murray, S.J., William A. Norgren, R.A.F. MacKenzie, S.J., Clement J. McNaspy, Bishop G. Emmett Carter and Bishop Robert H. Mueller.  The Second Vatican Council—1962-1965—remains a watershed event in the history of the Catholic Church. Catholics and many other Christians will want to return to the source documents to better understand the church of tradition and build a more responsive community of believers for the present and future.

In the 2-page preface written in 1948, he states such ground-shakingly obvious facts about the human psyche, that you'll wonder why these ideas had never dawned on you before. Then, into the main text of the book, and you're spirited away into an adventure that explores all forms of mythology and their importance in founding different cultures all around the world. But it goes much further than simply reciting tales from the past. The narrative (thoroughly annotated with references to other works) is so reassuring and worldly-wise, that the book is almost impossible to put down. Yet, this author seems to be humble and meek, despite the cavalcade of knowledge and calmly-considered conclusions. At one point, he claims that Buddhism and Hinduism are the best religions because they do not preach that a single figurehead is the goal of your worship, but that these religions simply suggest pathways to enlightenment. Compare Islam, Judaism and Christianity, where a single God is the end to all means. The latter religions are also represented by the most warlike countries!

They consider themselves the new chosen—congressmen, generals, and foreign dictators who meet in confidential cells, to pray and plan for a ""leadership led by God,"" to be won not by force but through ""quiet diplomacy."" Their base is a leafy estate overlooking the Potomac in Arlington, Virginia, and Jeff Sharlet is the only journalist to have reported from inside its walls.The Family is about the other half of American fundamentalist power—not its angry masses, but its sophisticated elites. Sharlet follows the story back to Abraham Vereide, an immigrant preacher who in 1935 organized a small group of businessmen sympathetic to European fascism, fusing the far right with his own polite but authoritarian faith. From that core, Vereide built an international network of fundamentalists who spoke the language of establishment power, a ""family"" that thrives to this day. In public, they host Prayer Breakfasts; in private, they preach a gospel of ""biblical capitalism,"" military might, and American empire. Citing Hitler, Lenin, and Mao as leadership models, the Family's current leader, Doug Coe, declares, ""We work with power where we can, build new power where we can't.""Sharlet's discoveries dramatically challenge conventional wisdom about American fundamentalism, revealing its crucial role in the unraveling of the New Deal, the waging of the cold war, and the no-holds-barred economics of globalization. The question Sharlet believes we must ask is not ""What do fundamentalists want?"" but ""What have they already done?""Part history, part investigative journalism, The Family is a compelling account of how fundamentalism came to be interwoven with American power, a story that stretches from the religious revivals that have shaken this nation from its beginning to fundamentalism's new frontiers. No other book about the right has exposed the Family or revealed its far-reaching impact on democracy, and no future reckoning of American fundamentalism will be able to ignore it.

You are walking asleep. There's no safety in that!    In The Invitation, visionary writer and teacher Oriah Mountain Dreamer wrote about what we long for. In The Dance, she explored how to live this longing to the fullest. Now, in The Call, she completes the trilogy, showing us why we are here and why we must each undertake that journey from longing to living fully and deeply in the world. Each of us, Oriah believes, has our own call, our own way to discover and live fully our true selves and our heart's desires. But the call cannot be found in the expectations of others or in the outside world; it can only be found within ourselves. And heeding it is not a matter of doing, but of accepting, ""not doing."" With her trademark practical style, Oriah gently guides us through her journey to find and heed her own call. What she discovered is that to be fully human is consciously to be who we truly are. By joining Oriah on this path, we may find the way to live, awake to our distinct essence. The key is to give up striving to become who we think we should be and to embrace our true self, imperfections and all.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Alongside Plotinus and Leibniz, he asserts that all nature is animate with endless congeries of monads that are ever in pursuit of becoming.

The Intimate Merton: His Life from His Journals,Thomas Merton,religion,First published in 1999,/works/OL461674W?edition=ia%3Aintimatemertonhi00mert,/authors/OL26986A/Thomas_Merton,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL41403M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  HarperSanFrancisco|Language English|Pages 374,"In this diary-like memoir, composed of his most poignant and insightful journal entries, The Intimate Merton lays bare the steep ways of Thomas Merton's spiritual path. Culled from the seven volumes of his personal journals, this twenty nine year chronicle deepens and extends the story Thomas Merton recounted and made famous in The Seven Storey Mountain. This book is the spiritual autobiography of our century's most celebrated monk -- the wisdom gained from the personal experience of an enduring spiritual teacher. Here is Merton's account of his life's major challenges, his confrontations with monastic and church hierarchies, his interaction with religious traditions east and west, and his antiwar and civil-rights activities. In The Intimate Merton we engage a writer's art of ""confession and witness"" as he searches for a contemporary, authentic, and global spirituality. Recounting Merton's earliest days in the monastery to his journey east to meet the Dalai Lama, The Intimate Merton captures the essence of what makes Thomas Merton's life journey so perennially relevant.

Leading scholars explore the role of the spread of Christianity and the formation of new principalities in the birth of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland and Rus' around the year 1000. Drawing on history, archaeology and art history, and emphasizing problems related to the sources and historiographical debates, they demonstrate the complex interdependence between the processes of religious and political change, covering conditions prior to the introduction of Christianity, the adoption of Christianity, and the development of the rulers' power. Regional patterns emerge, highlighting both the similarities in ruler-sponsored cases of Christianization, and differences in the consolidation of power and in the use made of institutions introduced by Christianity. The essays reveal how local societies adopted Christianity; medieval ideas of what constituted the dividing line between Christians and non-Christians; and the connections between Christianity and power.

The same morning--the first of a new Muslim century--hundreds of gunmen stunned the world by seizing Islam's holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Armed with rifles that they had smuggled inside coffins, these men came from more than a dozen countries, launching the first operation of global jihad in modern times. Led by a Saudi preacher named Juhayman al Uteybi, they believed that the Saudi royal family had become a craven servant of American infidels, and sought a return to the glory of uncompromising Islam. With nearly 100,000 worshippers trapped inside the holy compound, Mecca's bloody siege lasted two weeks, inflaming Muslim rage against the United States and causing hundreds of deaths.Despite U.S. assistance, the Saudi royal family proved haplessly incapable of dislodging the occupier, whose ranks included American converts to Islam. In Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini blamed the Great Satan--the United States --for defiling the shrine, prompting mobs to storm and torch American embassies in Pakistan and Libya. The desperate Saudis finally enlisted the help of French commandos led by tough-as-nails Captain Paul Barril, who prepared the final assault and supplied poison gas that knocked out the insurgents. Though most captured gunmen were quickly beheaded, the Saudi royal family responded to this unprecedented challenge by compromising with the rebels' supporters among the kingdom's most senior clerics, helping them nurture and export Juhayman's violent brand of Islam around the world. This dramatic and immensely consequential story was barely covered in the press in the pre-CNN, pre--Al Jazeera days, as Saudi Arabia imposed an information blackout and kept foreign correspondents away. Yaroslav Trofimov now penetrates this veil of silence, interviewing for the first time scores of direct participants in the siege, including former terrorists, and drawing on hundreds of documents that had been declassified on his request. Written with the pacing, detail, and suspense of a real-life thriller, The Siege of Mecca reveals how Saudi reaction to the uprising in Mecca set free the forces that produced the attacks of 9/11, and the harrowing circumstances that surround us today.

I take away [from his works] the compelling idea that there's serious evil in the world, and hardship and pain. And we should be humble and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things. But we shouldn't use that as an excuse for cynicism and inaction. I take away . . . the sense we have to make these efforts knowing they are hard.""—President Barack Obama Forged during the tumultuous but triumphant postwar years when America came of age as a world power, The Irony of American History is more relevant now than ever before. Cited by politicians as diverse as Hillary Clinton and John McCain, Niebuhr's masterpiece on the incongruity between personal ideals and political reality is both an indictment of American moral complacency and a warning against the arrogance of virtue. Impassioned, eloquent, and deeply perceptive, Niebuhr's wisdom will cause readers to rethink their assumptions about right and wrong, war and peace.

Science shows us ways of interpreting the physical world, while spirituality helps us cope with reality. But the extreme of either is impoverishing. The belief that all is reducible to matter and energy leaves out a huge range of human experience: emotions, yearnings, compassion, culture. At the same time, holding unexamined spiritual beliefs - beliefs that are contradicted by evidence, logic, and experience - can lock us into fundamentalist cages."" ""Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",17 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

The Church has grown from a handful of disciples in the first century to over one billion members in the twenty-first, resulting in profound changes that demand a theological response. In this sweeping history, renowned scholar Richard McBrien reveals the evolution of the Church's relationship to the divine, its leadership of the faithful, and its role as a global religion. The Church answers the questions raised by this extraordinary history, including:Where did the idea of the pope's infallibility come from?Why are priests celibate and women barred from the priesthood?What inspired the Inquisition?What was the position of the Catholic Church on Hitler's policies in World War II?What is the Church's relationship to Islam?How will the growth of the Church in South America, Africa, and Asia shape its future?McBrien helps the reader understand the evolution of the Catholic Church's understanding of itself through the centuries, its leadership, and its relationship to national governments and world religions. From Jesus's apostle Peter to Pope Benedict XVI, The Church explains in layperson's terms the evolution of the Catholic Church, its power, its scope, its theology, and its influence.

Knopf,              Distributed by Random House|Language English|Pages 362","Daniel Jonah Goldhagen cuts through the historical and moral fog to lay out the full extent of the Catholic Church's involvement in the Holocaust, transforming a narrow discussion fixated on Pope Pius XII into the long overdue investigation of the Church throughout Europe. He shows that the Church's and the Pope's complicity in the persecution of the Jews was much deeper than has been understood. The Church's leaders were fully aware of the persecutions. They did not speak out and urge resistance. Instead, they supported many aspects of the persecution. Some clergy even took part in the mass murder. But Goldhagen goes further. He develops a new, precise way for assessing the Church and its clergy's culpability, which was more extensive and varied than has been supposed. He then shows that the Church has, even according to its own doctrine, an unacknowledged duty of repair. He explores it, analyzes the Church's tactics of evasion, and delineates all that the Church must do to repair the harm it inflicted on Jews, and to heal itself. Brilliantly researched and reasoned, A Moral Reckoning is a path-breaking book of profound, and potentially explosive, importance. - Publisher.

How to Teach Religion,George Herbert Betts,religion,First published in 1919,/works/OL8078638W,/authors/OL2689448A/George_Herbert_Betts,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8492512M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 25, 2007|Publisher  Kessinger Publishing, LLC|Language English|Pages 228","The teacher of religion needs to be very sure of himself at one point. He ought to be able to answer affirmatively the question, ""Have I the prophetic impulse in my teaching?"" Sooner or later, practical difficulties will ""come not singly but by battalions,"" and the spirit needs to be fortified against discouragement. When driven back to the second or third line defense it is important that such a line really exists; the consciousness of being the spokesman for God makes the teacher invulnerable and unconquerable.But in order that this divine impulse may attain its greatest strength and find the most direct, articulate, and effective expression, the teacher must know how as well as what to teach. The most precious spiritual energy may be lost because improperly directed or controlled. Unhesitating insight into the solution of practical problems helps to open up a channel through which the prophetic impulse can find fullest expression.There is no substitute for mastery of the technique of the teaching process. Prayerful consecration cannot take its place. This ready command of the methods of teaching, on the other hand, is in no sense an equivalent of the consciousness of having been ""called"" or ""chosen"" to teach religion. The two must go hand in hand. No one who feels himself divinely appointed for this sacred task dares ignore the responsibility of becoming a ""workman not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.""This volume by Dr. Betts offers the earnest teacher of religion an exceptional opportunity to make more effective his ideal of instruction. The treatment applies the best of modern educational science to the problems of the church school, without, however, for a moment, forgetting that a vital religious experience is the final goal of all our teaching.Besides setting forth the underlying principles of religious teaching in a clear and definite way, the author has included in every chapter a rich fund of Illustration and concrete application which cannot fail to prove immediately helpful in every church classroom. It is also believed that students of religious education will find this treatment of method by Professor Betts the most fundamental and sane that has yet appeared in the field.

He brings together a wealth of meditative and mystical influences--from John of the Cross to Eastern desert monasticism--to create a spiritual path for today. Most important, he shows how the peace contacted through meditation should not be sought in order to evade the problems of contemporary life, but can instead be directed back out into the world to affect positive change.Contemplative Prayer is one of the most well-known works of spirituality of the last one hundred years, and it is a must-read for all seeking to live a life of purpose in today's world.In a moving and profound introduction, Thich Nhat Hanh offers his personal recollections of Merton and compares the contemplative traditions of East and West.From the Trade Paperback edition.

If God is good--: faith in the midst of suffering and evil,Randy C.

Many of us are experiencing it now. As we have seen in recent years, evil is real in our world, present and close to each one of us.In such difficult times, suffering and evil beg questions about God--Why would an all-good and all-powerful God create a world full of evil and suffering? And then, how can there be a God if suffering and evil exist? These are ancient questions, but also modern ones as well. Atheists such as Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and even former believers like Bart Ehrman answer the question simply: The existence of suffering and evil proves there is no God.In this captivating new book, best-selling author Randy Alcorn challenges the logic of disbelief, and brings a fresh, realistic, and thoroughly biblical insight to the issues these  important questions raise. Alcorn offers insights from his conversations with men and women whose lives have been torn apart by suffering, and yet whose faith in God burns brighter than ever. He reveals the big picture of who God is and what God is doing in the world--now and forever. And he equips you to share your faith more clearly and genuinely in this world of pain and fear. As he did in his best-selling book, Heaven, Randy Alcorn delves deep into a profound subject, and through compelling stories, provocative questions and answers, and keen biblical understanding, he brings assurance and hope to all.From the Hardcover edition.

He makes the provocative case that to remedy this problem, we should return to teaching religion in the public schools. Alongside ""reading, writing, and arithmetic,"" religion ought to become the ""Fourth R"" of American education.Many believe that America's descent into religious illiteracy was the doing of activist judges and secularists hell-bent on banishing religion from the public square. Prothero reveals that this is a profound misunderstanding. ""In one of the great ironies of American religious history,"" Prothero writes, ""it was the nation's most fervent people of faith who steered us down the road to religious illiteracy. Just how that happened is one of the stories this book has to tell.""Prothero avoids the trap of religious relativism by addressing both the core tenets of the world's major religions and the real differences among them. Complete with a dictionary of the key beliefs, characters, and stories of Christianity, Islam, and other religions, Religious Literacy reveals what every American needs to know in order to confront the domestic and foreign challenges facing this country today.

We listen as Koran-thumping preachers, hardened holy warriors and fresh-faced recruits, police investigators, military commandos, and spies try to make sense of the epidemic chaos that threatens the region - and now the world beyond.Based on reporting both before and after September 11, Allah's Torch is an action-packed and thought-provoking narrative that enables readers to see the face of Islamic terror more clearly and assess the threat for themselves.

Four hundred years later Viktor Werner, a biologist, causes an international uproar when he creates in his laboratory a complex organic clay crystal that can reproduce and which has a metabolism. He has, in effect, manufactured a primitive organism out of inorganic materials. We learn of Viktor's life after his discovery as he starts new research and is pursued by his own inner and outer demons. In this elegantly written and immaculately constructed story of two men who suffer similar punishments for their hubris, Harry Mulisch attempts nothing less than to unravel the structure and meaning of man's being.

Over the two hundred years that followed, Islam and Christianity—both firm in the belief that they were at God's work—fought for dominion of the Holy Land, clashing in a succession of chillingly brutal wars: the Crusades.For the first time, this book tells the story of that epic struggle from the perspective of both Christians and Muslims. A vivid and fast-paced narrative history, it exposes the full horror, passion, and barbaric grandeur of the Crusading era, leading us into a world of legendary champions—such as Richard the Lionheart and Saladin—shadowy Assassins, poet-warriors, and pious visionaries; across the desert sands of Egypt to the verdant forests of Lebanon; and through the ancient cities of Constantinople, Cairo, and Damascus.Drawing on painstaking original research and an intimate knowledge of the Near East, Thomas Asbridge uncovers what drove Muslims and Christians alike to embrace the ideals of jihad and crusade, revealing how these holy wars reshaped the medieval world and why they continue to influence events today.

Drawing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 9-11 attacks, Heaven's Gate, the Catholic sex abuse scandals, and many other recent cases, Sacred Fury explains the logics behind these faith driven acts.

Despite these repeated attempts, few have been able to move past the rhetoric and understand the true nature of Jesus's political views.Now, in The Political Teachings of Jesus, longtime political analyst and commentator Tod Lindberg goes beyond political punditry to address how Jesus's words and teachings—once a radical set of ideas—have come to define our concept of government and our vision for society. With nuanced prose, Lindberg draws a crucial distinction between Christ's religious and political teachings, presenting a detailed discussion of the world transformation that Jesus sought through his words, stories, and sayings.Guiding readers through the social and political dialogue of the Gospels, Lindberg expertly analyzes how Jesus's principles of universal freedom and equality have combined in our social order to become the unacknowledged bedrock of the modern world. In addition, he offers a provocative look at the role that Jesus's words have played in the formation of the modern democratic ideal, demonstrating how the basic principles of both liberal and conservative thought find common roots in the Christian messiah's words.Through close reading of the Sermon on the Mount and Jesus's parables, Lindberg offers a sophisticated portrait of Jesus as a teacher of unique insight and perception, one whose political views have transcended time and become essential to the way everyone lives in our society. In an era when people on both sides of the aisle are prone to using Jesus's beliefs for their own ends, The Political Teachings of Jesus is a refreshingly clear-eyed take on our shared concepts of government and society—and their common roots between the covers of the New Testament.

Religious and biblical scholar Bart Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself are the results of both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes.  In this compelling and fascinating book, Ehrman shows where and why changes were made in our earliest surviving manuscripts, explaining for the first time how the many variations of our cherished biblical stories came to be, and why only certain versions of the stories qualify for publication in the Bibles we read today. Ehrman frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultra — conservative views of the Bible.

Black|Language English|Pages 76,"As every enquiry, which regards religion, is of the utmost importance, there are two questions in particular, which challenge our attention, to wit, that concerning its foundation in reason, and that concerning its origin in human nature. Happily, the first question, which is the most important, admits of the most obvious, at least, the clearest solution. The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author; and no rational enquirer can, after serious reflection, suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine Theism and Religion. But the other question, concerning the origin of religion in human nature, is exposed to some more difficulty. The belief of invisible, intelligent power has been very generally diffused over the human race, in all places and in all ages; but it has neither perhaps been so universal as to admit of no exception, nor has it been, in any degree, uniform in the ideas, which it has suggested. Some nations have been discovered, who entertained no sentiments of Religion, if travellers and historians may be credited; and no two nations, and scarce any two men, have ever agreed precisely in the same sentiments. It would appear, therefore, that this preconception springs not from an original instinct or primary impression of nature, such as gives rise to self-love, affection between the sexes, love of progeny, gratitude, resentment; since every instinct of this kind has been found absolutely universal in all nations and ages, and has always a precise determinate object, which it inflexibly pursues. The first religious principles must be secondary; such as may easily be perverted by various accidents and causes, and whose operation too, in some cases, may, by an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, be altogether prevented. What those principles are, which give rise to the original belief, and what those accidents and causes are, which direct its operation, is the subject of our present enquiry.

The great evangelical movements of today are not a vanguard. They are a remnant, unraveling at every edge. Conversions. Baptisms. Membership. Retention. Participation. Giving. Attendance. Impact upon the culture at large. All are down and dropping. When veteran religion reporter Christine Wicker set out to investigate the evangelical movement, her intention was to forge through the stereotypes and shed new light on this highly divisive religious group. But the story soon morphed into an entirely new and shocking tale of discovery, as Wicker's research unearthed much more than she originally bargained for.Everywhere Wicker traveled she heard whispers of diminishing statistics, failed campaigns, and empty churches. Even as evangelical forces trumpet their purported political and social victories on the national and local fronts, insiders are anguishing over their significant losses and preparing to rebuild for the future. The idea that evangelicals represent and speak for Christianity in America is one of the greatest publicity scams in history, a perfect coup accomplished by savvy politicos and zealous religious leaders who understand the weaknesses of the nation's media and exploit them brilliantly.With her trademark vivid, firsthand reporting, Christine Wicker takes us deep inside the world of evangelicals, exposing the surprising statistics and details of this unexpected fall. Wicker shows us how the virtues of evangelicals are killing them as surely as their vices and that, to fully comprehend how and why this is happening, we'll need to understand both.

The dark sacrament,David M.

Kiely and Christina McKenna faithfully recount ten contemporary cases of demon possession, haunted houses, and exorcism, and profile the work of two living, active exorcists: Canon William Lendrum, a Protestant, and Father Ignatius McCarthy, a Roman Catholic. Kiely and McKenna conducted countless interviews with victims, families, witnesses, and clergy who assisted in performing multiple rites of exorcism. Many of the accounts are very recent and, in some cases, ongoing. Kiely and McKenna serve as trustworthy guides on this suspense-filled journey into the bizarre, offering concrete advice on how to avoid falling prey to the dark side. Exorcists Canon Lendrum and Father Ignatius reveal their fears, failings, and victories as they reflect on their forty years of service battling the Devil and his minions.The Dark Sacrament includes the following chilling stories:A woman is tormented by her evil dead grandmother, causing her to coil like a snake, snarl, and be invaded by several demons.A housewife is haunted by the answers from her children playing on a Ouija board and by a historical character who sexually terrorizes her so much that she is too ashamed to admit it even to her husband.A young girl experiences astral travel when the Angel of Death enters her body and takes her along on a frightening journey.A boy's temperament turns dark as he is tortured by demons, causing him to become harmful to others—an unresolved 2007 case that is ongoing. Thoroughly researched and impressively wide-ranging, The Dark Sacrament contains an appendix with detailed historical analysis, translated prayers of exorcism, and fascinating notes on important terms and practices.

Paul, Trench, Trubner","Two of the most important and influential works by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) here in one volume. The first marks the beginning of pragmatism.  His opening writings, The Fixation of Belief , How to Make Our Ideas Clear , and The Doctrine of Chances , are perhaps his most well-known and influential works, and serve to lay the groundwork for his concept of pragmatism. While any of Peirce's essays stand alone quite well, they become more powerful and prophetic when digested together.  The second presents Peirce's innovative essays on scientific metaphysics.  (Peirce was) ""one of the most original thinkers and system builders of any time, and certainly the greatest philosopher the United States has ever seen"".--Joseph Brent, biographer.

Interest in the history and theology of churches in non-Western contexts is growing rapidly as 'old world' churches face this new reality. This book focuses on how Asian Christian theologies have been shaped by the interaction of Christian communities with the societies around them and how they relate to the specific historical contexts from which they have emerged. The distinctiveness of Asian Christianity is shown to be the outcome of dealing with various historical challenges. Questions addressed include:How does Asian Christianity relate to local socio-cultural, religious and political environments?What is distinctive about the historical development of Asian theologies?How have Asian theologies contributed to contemporary theological discussions within world Christianity?

Drawing at once on the traditions of German Romanticism and Jewish messianism, their thought was organized around the cabalistic idea of the “tikkoun”: redemption. Redemption and Utopia uses the concept of “elective affinity” to explain the surprising community of spirit that existed between redemptive messianic religious thought and the wide variety of radical secular utopian beliefs held by this important group of intellectuals. The author outlines the circumstances that produced this unusual combination of religious and non-religious thought and illuminates the common assumptions that united such seemingly disparate figures as Martin Buber, Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin and Georg Lukács.

What Have They Done with Jesus?,Ben Witherington,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL275076W,/authors/OL31062A/Ben_Witherington,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9242844M-M.jpg,"Publish Date October 3, 2006|Publisher  HarperOne|Language English|Pages 342","Strange theories about Jesus seem to ooze from our culture with increasing regularity. Popular books and network TV specials proposing bizarre, historically unfounded tales of Jesus's mysterious bloodline and secret teachings continue to titillate the religiously curious. Witherington, one of the top Jesus scholars today, will have none of it. There were no ""Jesus Papers,"" no ""Lost Christianities,"" no secret ""Gnostic teachings"" in the first century. With leading scholars and popular purveyors of bad history in his crosshairs, Witherington reveals what we can–and cannot–know about the real Jesus.Utilizing a fresh ""personality profile"" approach, Witherington highlights core Christian claims by investigating the major figures in Jesus's inner circle of followers: Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Thomas, Peter, James the brother of Jesus, Paul, and the mysterious ""beloved disciple."" In each chapter Witherington satisfies our curiosities and answers the full range of questions about these key figures and what each of them can teach us about the historical Jesus. In what amounts to a vigorous defense of traditional Christianity, What Have They Done With Jesus? offers a compelling portrait of Jesus's core message according to those who knew him best.

In recent years some of the more fundamentalist regimes, such as those of Iran, Pakistan, Sudan and the northern states of Nigeria have reintroduced Islamic law in place of western criminal codes. Peters gives a detailed account of the classical doctrine and traces the enforcement of criminal law from the Ottoman period to the present day. The accounts of actual cases which range from theft, banditry, murder, fornication and apostasy shed light on the complexities of the law, and the sensitivity and perspicacity of the qadis who implemented it. This is the first single-authored account of both the theory and practice of Islamic criminal law. It will be invaluable for students, and scholars in the field, as well as for professionals looking for comprehensive coverage of the topic.

He called for help, but it was too late. Two trials and eight years later, the founder of the largest reform synagogue in southern New Jersey became the first rabbi ever convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.In a gripping examination of the misuses of the pulpit and the self-delusions of power, Arthur J. Magida paints a devastating portrait of a manipulative man who used his position of trust in the temple to attract several mistresses -- and to befriend a lonely recovering alcoholic, whom he convinced to kill his wife ""for the good of Israel.""The Rabbi and the Hit Man straddles the juncture of faith and trust, and confronts issues of sex, narcissism, arrogance, and adultery. It is the definitive account of a charismatic clergyman who paid the ultimate price for ignoring his own words of wisdom: ""We live at any moment with our total past ... What we do will stay with us forever.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But the murder seemed to make it twelve.  The weekend really started when a perfectly strange young man was seen on the stairs. Later that day, a woman houseguest discovered all of her left shoes were missing. Who would want them? And why?  Then things stop being merely peculiar. A dead body is found, some valuable snuffboxes are stolen and two children who are staying with the Findons disappear. Strange alliances are formed and romance starts to blossom even as it becomes apparent that someone in the house is a killer.  In her story of an English house party with violence as a most unwelcome guest, E. X. Ferrars blends humor, suspicion and suspense for a taut and absorbing entertainment.

Lewis's Mere Christianity. It has long been believed that science and faith cannot mingle. Faith rejects the rational, while science restricts us to a life with no meaning beyond the physical. It is an irreconcilable war between two polar-opposite ways of thinking and living. Written for believers, agnostics, and atheists alike, The Language of God provides a testament to the power of faith in the midst of suffering without faltering from its logical stride. Readers will be inspired by Collins's personal story of struggling with doubt, as well as the many revelations of the wonder of God's creation that will forever shape the way they view the world around them. - Publisher.  Dr. Francis Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, is one of the world's leading scientists. He works at the cutting edge of the study of DNA, the code of life. Yet he is also a man of unshakable faith in God and scripture. He believes that God cares about us and can intervene in human affairs -- on rare occasions, even miraculously. Collins has personally discovered some of the scientific evidence for the common descent of all living creatures, even though he repudiates the materialist, atheistic worldview argued by many prominent Darwinists. In short, Dr. Collins provides a satisfying solution for the dilemma that haunts everyone who believes in God and respects science. Faith in God and faith in science can be harmonious -- combined into one worldview. The God that he believes in is a God who can listen to prayers and cares about our souls. The biological science he has advanced is compatible with such a God. For Collins, science does not conflict with the Bible, science enhances it. For many years Dr. Collins kept his views largely to himself, as he helped oversee the Human Genome Project's stunning sequencing of the code of life. Now, in what may be the most important melding of reason and revelation since C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity, Dr. Collins explains himself in detail. The Language of God makes the case for God and for science. Dr. Collins considers and rejects several positions along the spectrum from atheism to young-earth creationism -- including agnosticism and Intelligent Design. Instead, he proposes a new synthesis, a new way to think about an active, caring God who created humankind through evolutionary processes. He has heard every argument against faith from scientists, and he can refute them. He has also heard the needless rejection of scientific truths by some people of faith, and he can counter that, too. He explains his own journey from atheism to faith, and then takes readers on a stunning tour of modern science to show that physics, chemistry, and biology can all fit together with belief in God and the Bible. The Language of God is essential reading for anyone who wonders about the deepest questions of all: Why are we here? How did we get here? And what does life mean? - oldearth.org   Read more Read less",20 Want to read|1 Currently reading|4 Have read

Now he turns to the most profound mystery: What happens after we die? Is this one question we were not meant to answer, a riddle whose solution the universe keeps to itself? Chopra tells us there is abundant evidence that ""the world beyond"" is not separated from this world by an impassable wall; in fact, a single reality embraces all worlds, all times and places. At the end of our lives we ""cross over"" into a new phase of the same soul journey we are on right this minute.In Life After Death, Chopra draws on cutting-edge scientific discoveries and the great wisdom traditions to provide a map of the afterlife. It's a fascinating journey into many levels of consciousness. But far more important is his urgent message: Who you meet in the afterlife and what you experience there reflect your present beliefs, expectations, and level of awareness. In the here and now you can shape what happens after you die.By bringing the afterlife into the present moment, Life After Death opens up an immense new area of creativity. Ultimately there is no division between life and death--there is only one continuous creative project. Chopra invites us to become cocreators in this subtle realm, and as we come to understand the one reality, we shed our irrational fears and step into a numinous sense of wonder and personal power.From the Hardcover edition.

Leon Wieseltier, a diligent but doubting son, recites the Jewish prayer of mourning at his father's grave, and then embarks on the traditional year of saying the kaddish daily.Wieseltier's highly acclaimed Kaddish is the spiritual and thoughtful journal of one of America's most brilliant intellectuals. Driven to explore th origins of the kaddish, from the ancient legend of a wayeard ghost to a 17th-century Ukranian pogrom, he offers as well a mourner's response to the questions of fate, freedom, and faith stirred up in death's wake. Lyric, learned, and deeply moving, Kaddish>/b> is suffused with love: a son's embracing of the traditon bequethed to him by his father, a scholar's savoring of its beauty, and a writer's revealing it, proudly unadorned, to the reader.

World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to ""mindfulness""—the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.  Lucidly and beautifully written, Peace Is Every Step contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh's experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already is—in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part—and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of Peace Is Every Step encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the ""mindless"" into the mindFUL.  In this modern spiritual classic, a world spiritual leader and Zen master shows how to adapt simple Zen principles for daily living and the way to peace--the first practical book on the subject since Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. Peace Is Every Step offers ways to use everyday events--washing dishes, eating a meal, sitting in traffic--in the quest for peace and fulfillment.

Why does the church insist upon making Jesus the object of its attention rather than heeding his message? Esteemed Harvard minister Peter J. Gomes believes that excessive focus on the Bible and doctrines about Jesus have led the Christian church astray. ""What did Jesus preach?"" asks Gomes. To recover the transformative power of the gospel—""the good news""—Gomes says we must go beyond the Bible and rediscover how to live out Jesus' original revolutionary message of hope:""Dietrich Bonhoeffer once warned against cheap grace, and I warn now against cheap hope. Hope is not merely the optimistic view that somehow everything will turn out all right in the end if everyone just does as we do. Hope is the more rugged, the more muscular view that even if things don't turn out all right and aren't all right, we endure through and beyond the times that disappoint or threaten to destroy us.""This gospel is offensive and always overturns the status quo, Gomes tells us. It's not good news for those who wish not to be disturbed, and today our churches resound with shrill speeches of fear and exclusivity or tepid retellings of a health-and-wealth gospel. With his unique blend of eloquence and insight, Gomes invites us to hear anew the radical nature of Jesus' message of hope and change. Using examples from ancient times as well as from modern pop culture, The Scandalous Gospel of Jesus shows us why the good news is every bit as relevant today as when it was first preached.

The nefarious witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts represent a low point of American history, made famous in works by Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne (himself a descendant of one of the judges), and Arthur Miller. The trials might have doomed Sewall to infamy except for a courageous act of contrition now commemorated in a mural that hangs beneath the golden dome of the Massachusetts State House picturing Sewall's public repentance. He was the only Salem witch judge to make amends.But, remarkably, the judge's story didn't end there. Once he realized his error, Sewall turned his attention to other pressing social issues. Struck by the injustice of the New England slave trade, a commerce in which his own relatives and neighbors were engaged, he authored ""The Selling of Joseph,"" America's first antislavery tract. While his peers viewed Native Americans as savages, Sewall advocated for their essential rights and encouraged their education, even paying for several Indian youths to attend Harvard College. Finally, at a time when women were universally considered inferior to men, Sewall published an essay affirming the fundamental equality of the sexes. The text of that essay, composed at the deathbed of his daughter Hannah, is republished here for the first time.In Salem Witch Judge, acclaimed biographer Eve LaPlante, Sewall's great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter, draws on family lore, her ancestor's personal diaries, and archival documents to open a window onto life in colonial America, painting a portrait of a man traditionally vilified, but who was in fact an innovator and forefather who came to represent the best of the American spirit.

The Left Hand of God,Michael Lerner,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL276544W?edition=ia%3Alefthandgodtakin00lern,/authors/OL2630725A/Michael_Lerner,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24276399M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  HarperCollins|Language English,"The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a popular aversion to God and religion by identifying religious values with a pro-war, pro-business, pro-rich, anti-science, and anti-environmental stance.Over the past few decades, the Republicans have achieved political dominance by forging a union with the Religious Right. This marriage has provided a sanctimonious veneer for policies that have helped the rich get richer while ignoring the needs of the middle class and the poor, dismantling environmental and civil liberties protections, and seeking global domination. The Right champions the materialism and ruthless selfishness promoted by unrestrained capitalism and then laments the moral crises of family instability and loneliness experienced by people who bring these commercial values into their homes and personal lives. In response, the Religious Right offers insular communities for the faithful and a culture that blames liberals, activist judges, homosexuals, independent women, and all secular people for the moral and spiritual emptiness so many Americans experience.Yet, however distorted both the Right's analysis and its solutions to America's spiritual crisis may be, it wins allegiance by addressing the human hunger for a life with some higher purpose. The Left, by contrast, remains largely tone-deaf to the spiritual needs of the American people. It is the yearning for meaning in life, not just the desire for money or power, that lies at the core of American politics.Addressing the central mystery of contemporary politics — why so many Americans vote against their own economic interests — The Left Hand of God provides an invaluable, timely, and blunt critique of the current state of faith in government. Lerner challenges the Left to give up its deeply held fear of religion and to distinguish between a domination-oriented, Right-Hand-of-God tradition and a more compassionate and hope-oriented Left-Hand-of-God worldview. Further, Lerner describes the ways that Democrats have misunderstood and alienated significant parts of their potential constituency. To succeed again, Lerner argues, the Democratic Party must rethink its relationship to God, champion a progressive spiritual vision, reject the old bottom line that promotes the globalization of selfishness, and deal head-on with the very real spiritual crisis that many Americans experience every day.Lerner presents a vision that incorporates and then goes far beyond contemporary liberal and progressive politics. He argues for a new bottom line in our economy, schools, and government. This is a fundamentally fresh approach,  one that takes spiritual needs seriously in our economic and political lives. Presenting an eight-point progressive spiritual covenant with America, Lerner provides a blueprint for how the Democratic Party can effectively challenge the Right and position itself to win the White House and Congress. By appealing to religious, secular, and spiritual but not necessarily religious people, The Left Hand of God blazes a trail that could change our world and reclaim America from the Religious Right.

Holt's classic study of the French religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Drawing on the scholarship of social and cultural historians of the Reformation, it shows how religion infused both politics and the socio-economic tensions of the period to produce a long extended civil war. Professor Holt integrates court politics and the political theory of the elites with the religious experiences of the popular classes, offering a fresh perspective on the wars and on why the French were willing to kill their neighbors in the name of religion. The book has been created specifically for undergraduates and general readers with no background knowledge of either French history or the Reformation. This new edition updates the text in the light of new work published in the last decade and the 'Suggestions for further reading' has been completely re-written.

The goal of God's Not Dead: Evidence for God in an Age of Uncertainty is straightforward: to help readers develop ""a faith that is real and credible -- and strong enough to help others find faith in God."" To that end, Rice Broocks outlines a roadmap that guides seekers to acknowledge the most basic truths of Christianity: There is overwhelming and exciting evidence for God's existence; The God who exists is indeed the God of the Bible; God has revealed his nature through his Son, Jesus Christ. Persuasive arguments crafted with tools borrowed from logic, science, and philosophy, as well as scripture, solidify the faith of the Christian reader and provide starting points for discussions with skeptics. With clear, easy-to-follow explanations of key concepts and controversies, God's Not Dead is apologetics for the twenty-first century, presented in layman's terms. Readers will be empowered not only to talk about their own faith with confidence but to lead others to a relationship with Jesus. - Publisher.

At the Root of This Longing,Carol L.

She finds inspiration in the story of fourteenth-century mystic Julian of Norwich and her direct experience of God, in India’s legendary Draupadi, who would not allow a brutal physical assault to damage her sense of personal power, as well as in Flinders’s own experiences as a meditation teacher and practitioner. Flinders reveals that spirituality and feminism are not mutually exclusive at all but very much require one another.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With a gripping story and deeply compelling message, it is unquestionably one of the most popular sacred texts of Asia and, along with the Bible and the Qur'an, one of the most important holy scriptures in the world. Part of an ancient Hindu epic poem, the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita takes place on a battlefield, where a war for the possession of a North Indian kingdom is about to ensue between two noble families related by blood. The epic's hero, young Prince Arjuna, is torn between his duty as a warrior and his revulsion at the thought of his brothers and cousins killing each other over control of the realm. Frozen by this ethical dilemma, he debates the big questions of life and death with the supreme Hindu deity Krishna, cleverly disguised as his charioteer. By the end of the story, Eastern beliefs about mortality and reincarnation, the vision and practice of yoga, the Indian social order and its responsibilities, family loyalty, spiritual knowledge, and the loftiest pursuits of the human heart are explored in depth. Explaining the very purpose of life and existence, this classic has stood the test of twenty-three centuries. It is presented here in a thoroughly accurate, illuminating, and beautiful translation that is sure to become the standard for our day.

With stories and personal anecdotes, Smith not only presents the basic beliefs and essential teachings of Christianity, but argues why religious belief matters in today's secular world.  Though there is a wide variety of contemporary interpretations of Christianity -- some of them conflicting -- Smith cuts through these to describe Christianity's ""Great Tradition,"" the common faith of the first millennium of believers, which is the trunk of the tree from which Christianity's many branches, twigs, and leaves have grown. This is not the exclusivist Christianity of strict fundamentalists, nor the liberal, watered-down Christianity practiced by many contemporary churchgoers. In exposing biblical literalism as unworkable as well as enumerating the mistakes of modern secularists, Smith presents the very soul of a real and substantive faith, one still relevant and worth believing in.Smith rails against the hijacked Christianity of politicians who exploit it for their own needs. He decries the exercise of business that widens the gap between rich and poor, and fears education has lost its sense of direction. For Smith, the media has become a business that sensationalizes news rather than broadening our understanding, and art and music have become commercial and shocking rather than enlightening. Smith reserves his harshest condemnation, however, for secular modernity, which has stemmed from the misreading of science -- the mistake of assuming that ""absence of evidence"" of a scientific nature is ""evidence of absence."" These mistakes have all but banished faith in transcendence and the Divine from mainstream culture and pushed it to the margins.Though the situation is grave, these modern misapprehensions can be corrected, says Smith, by reexamining the great tradition of Christianity's first millennium and reaping the lessons it holds for us today. This fresh examination of the Christian worldview, its history, and its major branches provides the deepest, most authentic vision of Christianity -- one that is both tolerant and substantial, traditional and relevant.

And since when did promoting and pursuing a progressive social agenda with a concern for economic security, health care, and educational opportunity mean you had to put faith in God aside?"" ""God's Politics offers a clarion call to make both our religious communities and our government more accountable to key values of the prophetic religious tradition - that is, make them pro-justice, pro-peace, pro-environment, pro-equality, pro-consistent ethic of life (beyond single-issue voting), and pro-family (without making scapegoats of single mothers or gays and lesbians). Our biblical faith and religious traditions simply do not allow us as a nation to continue to ignore the poor and marginalized, deny racial justice, tolerate the ravages of war, or turn away from the human rights of those made in the image of God. These are the values of love and justice, reconciliation, and community that Jesus taught and that are at the core of what many of us believe, Christian or not. In the tradition of prophets such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Day, and Desmond Tutu, Wallis inspires us to hold our political leaders and policies accountable by integrating our deepest moral convictions into our nation's public life.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

That view is mistaken. Both democracy and Christian faith, this book shows, call all Christians to make their beliefs effective in politics. But the discussion here differs from others. Most have trouble relating religion to democratic discussion and debate because they assume that religious differences cannot be publicly debated. Against this majority view, this book argues that Christian faith belongs in politics because it shares with democracy a full commitment to rational pursuit of the truth.  The book then develops ideals of justice and the common good Christians should advocate within the democratic process and shows the difference they make for contemporary politics in the United States, focusing specifically on issues of abortion, affirmative action, and economic distribution.

With God's Choice, he gives us an extraordinary chronicle of the rise of Pope Benedict XVI as well as an unflinching view of the Catholic Church at the dawn of a new era.When John Paul II lapsed into illness for the last time, people flocked from all over the world to pray outside his apartment. He had become a father figure to millions in a world bereft of strong paternal examples, and those millions now felt orphaned. After more than twenty-six years of John Paul II's guidance, the Catholic Church is entering a new age, with its bedrock traditions intact but with pressing questions to address in a rapidly changing world. Beginning with the story of John Paul's final months, God's Choice offers a remarkable inside account of the conclave that produced Benedict XVI as the next pope, drawing on George Weigel's unrivaled access to this complex event.Weigel also incisively surveys the current state of the Church around the world: its thriving populations in Africa, Latin America, and parts of the post-communist world; its collapse in western Europe; its continued struggles in Asia; and the vibrancy of many aspects of Catholic life in the United States, even as the Church in America struggles to overcome its recent experience of scandal.Reflecting on John Paul II's greatness, drawing on firsthand interviews to paint an intimate portrait of the new Pope, and boldly assessing the Church's current condition, God's Choice is an invaluable book for anyone seeking to understand the Catholic future and the larger human future the Church will help to shape.

Now Alan M. Dershowitz, one of our most brilliant legal minds and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Chutzpah, casts new light on these ancient tales. What he finds is . . . THE GENESIS OF JUSTICE Violence, lust, deception, murder, incest, and vengeance: These are the subjects of the biggest--and perhaps the juiciest--bestseller of all time, the Book of Genesis. Its oft-told tales have inspired and challenged humankind for generations. But perhaps never before has anyone examined these stories so provocatively from a modern legal perspective. Based on Alan Dershowitz's class at Harvard Law School, The Genesis of Justice shows how the Good Book is also a remarkable law book. According to Dershowitz, these seminal stories describe a people--and a God--struggling in a world before the invention of systematic rules, a primal place th   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Already the first blighted leaves glow scarlet on the red maples. It's a season of fullness and sweet longings made sweeter now by the fact that I can't be sure I'll see this time of the year again....-- from Learning to FallPhilip Simmons was just thirty-five years old in 1993 when he learned that he had ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and was told he had less than five years to live. As a young husband and father, and at the start of a promising literary career, he suddenly had to learn the art of dying. Nine years later, he has succeeded, against the odds, in learning the art of living.Now, in this surprisingly joyous and spirit-renewing book, he chronicles his search for peace and his deepening relationship with the mystery of everyday life.Set amid the rugged New Hampshire mountains he once climbed, and filled with the bustle of family life against the quiet progression of illness, Learning to Fall illuminates the journey we all must take -- ""the work of learning to live richly in the face of loss.""From our first faltering steps, Simmons says, we may fall into disappointment or grief, fall into or out of love, fall from youth or health. And though we have little choice as to the timing or means of our descent, we may, as he affirms, ""fall with grace, to grace.""With humor, hard-earned wisdom and a keen eye for life's lessons -- whether drawn from great poetry or visits to the town dump -- Simmons shares his discovery that even at times of great sorrow we may find profound freedom. And by sharing the wonder of his daily life, he offers us the gift of connecting more deeply and joyously with our own.From the Hardcover edition.

In Going Home he shows us the relationship between Buddha and Jesus by presenting a conversation between the two. In this unique way we learn how such concepts as resurrection and mindfulness converge. The brotherhood between Jesus and Buddha can teach us to ""practice in such a way that Buddha is born every moment of our daily life, that Jesus Christ is born every moment of our daily life.""

The first is the painting of God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Apparently one of the messages that Michelangelo wanted to convey is God's great desire to reach out to and be with the person he has created. If you look carefully at the painting, you notice that the figure of God is extended toward the man with great vigor. He twists his body to move it as close to the man as possible. His head is turned toward the man, and his gazed is fixed on him. God's arm is stretched out, his index finger is extended straight forward; every muscle is taut. It looks as if even in the midst of the splendor of all creation God's entire being is wrapped up in his desire to touch this man. His hand comes within a hair's breath of the hand of the man. God is as close as he can be. But having come that close, he allows just a little space, so that Adam can choose. He waits for Adam to make his move.  Adam, for his part, reclines in a lazy pose, leaning backward as if he has no interest at all in making a connection. He doesn't move forward, he doesn't hold out his hand, he doesn't lift a finger. He appears to be indifferent to or even unaware of the possibility of touching his Creator. All it would take is the slightest effort, the merest movement.  This picture says that the great desire of God is to be with the human beings he has made in his own image. This picture reminds us---God is closer than we think. He is never farther than a prayer away. All it takes is the barest effort, the lift of a finger.  But I also remember another, humbler work of art. It involves a series of books all centered around the question 'Where's Waldo?' Waldo will never make it to the Sistine Chapel. He looks nothing like the majestic deity of Michelangelo. He is a geeky-looking, glasses-wearing nerd with a striped shirt and goofy hat.  Waldo is supposed to be on every page. Whoever writes the book claims that it is so. But you couldn't prove it by me. He's often hidden to the untrained eye. You have to be willing to look for him. When you find him, there is a sense of joy and accomplishment. 'Surely Waldo was in the place, and I knew it not.' In fact, developing the capacity to track him down is part of the point of the book. If it was too easy---if every page consisted just of a giant picture of Waldo's face---no one would ever buy it. The difficulty of the task is what increases the power of discernment.  Part of what makes it hard to find Waldo is that he is so ordinary-looking. On some pages, he's surrounded by hundreds of look-alikes; Waldo-wannabees. He just seems to just blend in. You can be looking right at him without even knowing it. Where's Waldo? Why doesn't he show himself plainly? Why does he hide his face? He may not be absent, but he is elusive. He is Waldus absconditus---the Waldo who hides himself.  Let every day---every moment---of your life be another page. God is there, the Scriptures tell us---on every one of them. But the ease with which he may be found varies from one page to the next. So let's explore the truth found in both of these works of art: God is closer than you think.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Taking readers to biblical sites not seen by Westerners for decades, Feiler's journey uncovers little-known details about the common roots of  Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and affirms the importance of the Bible in today's world.In his intimate, accessible style, Feiler invites readers on a never-in-a-lifetime experience:Israel Feiler takes a perilous helicopter dive over Jerusalem, treks through secret underground tunnels, and locates the spot where David toppled Goliath.Iraq After being airlifted into Baghdad, Feiler visits the Garden of Eden and the birthplace of Abraham, and makes a life-threatening trip to the rivers of Babylon.Iran Feiler explores the home of the Bible's first messiah and uncovers the secret burial place of Queen Esther. In Where God Was Born, Feiler discovers that at the birth of Western religion, all faiths drew from one another and were open to coexistence. Feiler's bold realization is that the Bible argues for interfaith harmony. It cannot be ceded to one side in the debate over values. Feiler urges moderates to take back the Bible and use its powerful voice as a beacon of shared ideals.In his most ambitious work to date, Bruce Feiler has written a brave, uplifting story that stirs the deepest chords of our time. Where God Was Born offers a rare, universal vision of God that can inspire different faiths to an allegiance of hope.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Renowned archaeologist Shimon Gibson breaks new ground examining the critical last days of the life of Jesus using his extraordinary access to firsthand archaeological findings as principal evidence. Gibson explains: ""The purpose of this book is to unravel once and for all the mystery surrounding the final days of Jesus in Jerusalem: why he went there; how he came to be arrested, tried, and crucified; and where his place of burial was located. There is no doubt that some of my conclusions regarding Jesus and Jerusalem may be controversial.  ""Describing the events of the final days of Jesus chronologically, beginning with his entrance into Jerusalem on a donkey and ending with his burial in a tomb after having been crucified, Gibson unveils a vivid picture of first-century Jerusalem; its monuments, streets, and houses; and, of course, the Jewish Temple that was the jewel in the crown of the city. The Jesus that emerges in these pages is a teacher and healer who captures the fascination of the crowds. As a man from an accomplished and well-off rural background, trained in matters of ritual purification by John the Baptist, and as a believer in alternative healing methods, Jesus's speeches and teachings — made in the tinder-box atmosphere of Passover festivities in Jerusalem — scared the Jewish and Roman authorities to such a degree that they decided to have him put to death. Gibson reveals how archaeology has a major role to play not only in how the gospels should be read and understood, but also in understanding Jesus in his world.

I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist,Norman L.

Indeed, many view religion in general, and Christianity in particular, as unfounded and unreasonable. Norman Geisler and Frank Turek argue, however, that Christianity is not only more reasonable than all other belief systems, but is indeed more rational than unbelief itself. With conviction and clear thinking, Geisler and Turek guide readers through some of the traditional, tested arguments for the existence of a creator God. They move into an examination of the source of morality and the reliability of the New Testament accounts concerning Jesus. The final section of the book deals with a detailed investigation of the claims of Christ. This volume will be an interesting read for those skeptical about Christianity, as well as a helpful resource for Christians seeking to articulate a more sophisticated defense of their faith. - Publisher.

From Russia to Turkey to India, nations that swore off faith in the last centuryor even tried to stamp it outare now run by avowedly religious leaders. Formerly secular conflicts like the one in Palestine have taken on an overtly religious cast. God Is Back shines a bright light on this hidden world of faith, from exorcisms in Sao Paulo to religious skirmishing in Nigeria, to televangelism in California and house churches in China.Since the Enlightenment, intellectuals have assumed that modernization would kill religionand that religious America is an oddity. As God Is Back argues, religion and modernity can thrive together, and America is becoming the norm. Many things helped spark the global revival of religion, including the failure of communism and the rise of globalism. But, above all, twenty-first century religion is being fueled by a very American emphasis on competition and a customer- driven approach to salvation. These qualities have characterized this countrys faith ever since the Founders separated church and state, creating a religious free market defined by entrepreneurship, choice, and personal revelation. As market forces reshape the world, the tools and ideals of American evangelism are now spreading everywhere.The global rise of faith will have a dramatic and far- reaching impact on our century. Indeed, its destabilizing effects can already be seen far from Iraq or the World Trade Center. Religion plays a role in civil wars from Sri Lanka to Sudan. Along the tenth parallel, from West Africa to the Philippines, religious fervor and political unrest are reinforcing each other. God Is Back concludes by showing how the same American ideas that created our unique religious style can be applied around the globe to channel the rising tide of faith away from volatility and violence.

This contradiction provides a challenge for our understanding of ancient pagan religion. Certain forms of cult activity, including acclamations of 'one god' and the worship of Theos Hypsistos, the highest god, have sometimes been interpreted as evidence for pagan monotheism. This book discusses pagan monotheism in its philosophical and intellectual context, traces the evolution of new religious ideas in the time of the Roman empire, and evaluates the usefulness of the term 'monotheism' as a way of understanding these developments in later antiquity outside the context of Judaism and Christianity. In doing so, it establishes a new framework for understanding the relationship between polytheistic and monotheistic religious cultures between the first and fourth centuries ad""--Provided by publisher.

The Reformation and the visual arts,Sergiusz Michalski,religion,First published in 1993,/works/OL4045081W,/authors/OL752064A/Sergiusz_Michalski,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1711341M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1993|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 232,"Covering a vast geographical and chronological span, and bringing new and exciting material to light, The Reformation and the Visual Arts provides a unique overvie of religious images and iconoclasm, starting with the consequences of the Byzantine image controversy and ending with the Eastern Orthodox churches of the nineteenth century. The author argues that the image question played a large role in the divisions within European Protestantism and was intricately connected with the Eucharist controversy. He analyses the positions of the major Protestant reformers - Luther, Zwingli, Calvin and Karlstadt - on the legitimacy of religious paintings and investigates iconoclasm both as a form of religious and political protest and as a complex set of mock-revolutionary rites and denigration rituals. The book also contains new research on relations between Protestant iconoclasm and the extreme icon-worship of the Eastern Orthodox churches, and provides a brief discussion of Eastern protestantizing sects, especially in Russia.

His famous paper, Theology and Falsification, was first presented at a meeting of the Oxford Socratic Club chaired by C. S. Lewis and went on to become the most widely reprinted philosophical publication of the last five decades. Flew earned his fame by arguing that one should presuppose atheism until evidence of a God surfaces. He now believes that such evidence exists, and There Is a God chronicles his journey from staunch atheism to believer.For the first time, this book will present a detailed and fascinating account of Flew's riveting decision to revoke his previous beliefs and argue for the existence of God. Ever since Flew's announcement, there has been great debate among atheists and believers alike about what exactly this ""conversion"" means. There Is a God will finally put this debate to rest.This is a story of a brilliant mind and reasoned thinker, and where his lifelong intellectual pursuit eventually led him: belief in God as designer.

LIKE Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet...but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone.  LIKE Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him...yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy.Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany.  Tenderly he invites you to choose ""the better part""-a joyful life of ""living-room"" intimacy with him that flows naturally into ""kitchen service"" for him.How can you make that choice?  With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us-Marys and Marthas alike-can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy.From the Trade Paperback edition.

The book begins with the coming of the earliest images of Mecca/Medina into India and their dissemination by the print industry along with the pictures of local Sufi shrines and saints, and moves on to explore the adaptation of local Indian icons and symbols into Islamic iconography. Besides providing a historical context of the pre-print culture of popular Muslim visuality, the book also explores the impact the 1947 Partition of India may have made on the calendar art in south Asia – much of Indian popular art leaning more towards Hindu nationalism and leaving the Muslim art mostly with apolitical themes, while Pakistani poster art surprising maintaining the syncretism of Sufi saints and folklore. The last section is a short introspection on why such a vibrant visual culture continues to thrive among South Asian Muslims despite the questions raised by the orthodoxy on its legitimacy in Islam, and why images and popular visual cultures are inevitable for popular piety despite the orthodox Muslims’ increasing dissociation from them.

Bush.The struggle within American Christianity, Garry Wills argues, now and throughout our country's history, is between the head and the heart: between reason and emotion, Enlightenment and Evangelism. Why has this been so? How has the tension between the two poles played out, and with what consequences, over the past 400 years? How ""Christian"" is America, after all? Garry Wills brings a lifetime's worth of thought about these questions to bear on a magnificent historical reckoning that offers much needed perspective on some of the most contentious issues of our time.A religious revolution occurred in America in the 18th century, one that saw the emergence of an Enlightenment religious culture whose hallmarks were tolerance for other faiths and a belief that religion was a matter best divorced from political institutions-the proverbial ""separation of church and state."" Wills shows us just how incredibly radical a departure this separation was: there was simply no precedent for it. To put this leap in perspective, Wills provides a grounding in the pre-Enlightenment religion that preceded it, beginning with the early Puritans. He then provides a thrillingly clear unpacking of the steps, particularly Madison's and Jefferson's, by which church-state separation was enshrined in the Constitution, and reveals the great irony of the efforts of today's Religious Right to blur the lines between the two. In fact, it is precisely that separation that has allowed religion in America to flourish since the disestablishment of religion created a free market, as it were, and competition for souls led to the profusion of denominations across the length and breadth of the land.As Wills examines the key movements and personalities that have transformed America's religious landscape, we see again and again the same pattern emerge: a cooling of popular religious fervor followed by a grassroots explosion in evangelical activity, generally at a time of great social transformation and anxiety. But such forces inevitably go too far, provoking a backlash as is happening right now with the forces of Creationism and the anti-abortion fundamentalists.Garry Wills closes with a penetrating dissection of the Religious Right's current machinations and the threat they pose to the enlightened religion that has proved to be such a fertile and enduring force throughout American history. But in the end, Wills's abiding message is to be vigilant against the triumph of emotions over reason, but to know that the tension between the two is in fact necessary, inevitable, and unending.

At the time he was one among a handful of scholars from the West who were beginning to engage with the subject. In the intervening years, much has changed, and Islamic law is now understood as fundamental to any engagement with the study of Islam, its history, and its society, and Dr. Calder's work is integral to that engagement. In this book, Colin Imber has put together and edited four essays by Norman Calder that have never been previously published. Typically incisive, they categorize and analyze the different genres of Islamic juristic literature that was produced between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, showing what function they served both in the preservation of Muslim legal and religious traditions and in the day-to-day lives of their communities. The essays also examine the status and role of the jurists themselves and are to be particularly welcomed for giving clear answers to the controversial questions of how far Islamic law and juristic thinking changed over the centuries, and how far it was able to adapt to new circumstances. In his introduction to the volume, Robert Gleave assesses the place and importance of Norman Calder's work in the field of Islamic legal studies. This is a groundbreaking book from one of the most important scholars of his generation""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""While hostility toward the West has a long and varied history in the lands of Islam, its current concentration on America is new. So too is the cult of the suicide bomber. Brilliantly disentangling the crosscurrents of Middle Eastern history from the rhetoric of its manipulators, Bernard Lewis helps us understand the reasons for the increasingly dogmatic rejection of modernity by many in the Muslim world in favor of a return to a sacred past. Based on his George Polk Award-winning article for The New Yorker, The Crisis of Islam is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what Osama bin Laden represents and why his murderous message resonates so widely in the Islamic world.""--Jacket.

He wrote The Holy Piby as a guiding text, seeing Ethiopians - in the classical meaning of all Africans - as God's chosen people, and he preached self-determination and self-reliance. The Holy Piby is a major source of influence to the Rastafarian faith, which holds Haile Selassie I as Christ, and Marcus Garvey as his prophet. The Holy Piby consists of four books, and the seventh chapter of the second book identifies Marcus Garvey as one of three apostles of God. Original copies are extremely rare, and it is not even listed in the Library of Congress. The text was banned in Jamaica and many other Caribbean Islands until the late 1920s.

A Travel Guide to Heaven,Anthony Destefano,religion,First published in 2003,/works/OL278581W,/authors/OL2632227A/Anthony_Destefano,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7440942M-M.jpg,"Publish Date September 16, 2003|Publisher  Random House Audio|Language English","A recent Newsweek poll reports that 76 percent of Americans believe in heaven. Yet even avid believers have difficulty conjuring up more than vague images of halos, harps, and wispy angels in flowing robes. Anthony DeStefano knew there had to be a more complete, meaningful, and comforting vision of what heaven is like, and A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN is the entertaining and enlightening result.Using the Bible as his guide, the author notes that heaven is not only a spiritual place, but also a physical place, a fabulous ""luxury resort"" more sumptuous than any on Earth. The residents are real, their bodies transformed into their most perfect selves--physically, emotionally, and spiritually. By making a spiritual subject immensely physical, the book provides a picture of amazing places to visit, things to do, luxuries for pampering--not to mention deep, abiding joy.Combining the clarity and logic of C. S. Lewis with a terrific sense of fun and adventure, DeStefano creates a brilliant, reassuring portrait of heaven, a place that has intrigued and puzzled humankind throughout history.  With its clear view of the afterlife, A TRAVEL GUIDE TO HEAVEN might best be compared to James Van Praagh's Talking to Heaven or Betty J. Eadie's Embraced by the Light in its tremendous message of comfort and reassurance.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book presents a timely study of a neglected British Christian women's movement. Jenny Daggers charts the inception of the movement in the exciting times of the post-sixties decades, amid new currents generated in the British denominational churches, and the wider current of Women's Liberation. Focusing on Christian women's concern with the position of women in the church, this book identifies a core Christian women's theology which affirms a (rehabilitated) 'new Eve in Christ', and so contrasts with a concurrent paradigm shift taking shape in North American feminist theology. Daggers argues that this divergence is primarily due to the effect of the prolonged Church of England women's ordination debate upon the ethos of the British Christian women's movement.""--Provided by publisher.

In this conversation with Vatican reporter Andrea Tornielli, Francis explains—through memories from his youth and moving anecdotes from his experiences as a pastor—why “mercy is the first attribute of God.” God “does not want anyone to be lost. His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,” he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis asserts—on the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done.  The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading God’s message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, The Name of God Is Mercy resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds. It is being published in more than eighty countries around the world.  “The name of God is mercy. There are no situations we cannot get out of, we are not condemned to sink into quicksand.”—Pope Francis   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a result, the written Bible has dwelled in an historical vacuum. Recent archaeological evidence and insights from linguistic anthropology, however, point to the earlier era of the late-Iron Age as the formative period for the writing of biblical literature. How the Bible Became a Book combines these recent archaeological discoveries in the Middle East with insights culled from the history of writing to address how the Bible first came to be written down and then became sacred Scripture. This book provides rich insight into why these texts came to have authority as Scripture and explores why Ancient Israel, an oral culture, began to write literature, challenging the assertion that widespread literacy first arose in Greece during the fifth century BCE.

In UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders.  At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously-researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith.  Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America's fastest-growing religion and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief. Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty thousand Mormon fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God.  Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.  Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism's violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.  From the hardcover edition.

The issue is pressing insofar the last century has witnessed a gradual but profound transformation of the West's religious landscape. In today's context of diversity, people are often influenced by more than one religion. Multireligious identities are consequently on the rise. At one end of the spectrum are those who identify themselves as fully belonging to more than one tradition. One of the most prevalent combinations is Christianity and Buddhism This book addresses central and fundamental questions. How is it possible to be authentically Buddhist and authentically Christian when, for example, God is central to Christianity yet absent from Buddhism; when Christians have faith in Jesus Christ while Buddhists take refuge in the Buddha; when Christians hope for heaven and Buddhists hope for nirvana; and when Buddhists and Christians engage in different practices? Are those who identify themselves as belonging to both traditions profoundly irrational, religiously schizophrenic, or perhaps just spiritually superficial? Or is it possible somehow to reconcile the thought and practice of Buddhism and Christianity in such a way that one can be deeply committed to both? And if it is possible, will the influence of Buddhist Christians on each of these traditions be something to be regretted or celebrated?""--  ""The last century witnessed a gradual but profound transformation of the West's religious landscape.

It has also been part of every discussion of religious experience since the early twentieth century. Despite this centrality, ineffability is a concept that has largely been ignored by philosophers of religion. In this book, Bennett-Hunter builds on the recent work of David Cooper, who argues that the meaning of life can only be understood in terms of an ineffable source on which life depends, and engages with the work of continental philosophers, such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty and Karl Jaspers.  This is the first book to explore the concept of ineffability within contemporary philosophy of religion and provides a starting point for further scholarly debate. It will be of interest to scholars of philosophy of religion, theology, existentialism and phenomenology.  ""Philosophers have long concentrated on linguistic forms in a way that has isolated language from the rest of life, and this isolation has increasingly obscured for them the vast range of things that cannot be spoken. Bennett-Hunter is not the first philosopher to try and map this distracted field, but he is remarkable in the width and sympathy of his approach to the highly various thinkers whom he invokes to illuminate it.""     —Mary Midgley    Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

These religions represent the last vestiges of the magnificent civilizations in ancient history: Persia, Babylon, Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs.

He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious ""grammar"" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical ""logic"" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.    The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.    These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon ""myth"" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time.

The Cathars held revolutionary beliefs that threatened the authority of the Catholic Church as well as the legitimacy of feudal law:  They thought the idea of Hell to be a sham; they rejected all sacraments, including marriage; they thought private property an absurd notion and that all things worldly were corrupt; and they preached religious tolerance and equality of the sexes.Supported by the leaders of Languedoc, Catharism enraged the new and formidable pope, Innocent III, who was determined to flex the Church’s muscle after decades of ineffectual weakness.  Innocent resolved to eradicate what is now known as the Great Heresy.  He recruited the forces of France, eager to expand her territory to the south, to undertake a systematic extermination of the Cathars and their supporters through a series of crusades between 1209 and 1229.  By the time the wars were finally over, the ancient social fabric of the Languedoc had been destroyed, the territory of France reached as far as the Mediterranean, and a terrifying new force—the Inquisition—had been unleashed that would torment Europe for centuries.The Perfect Heresy eloquently chronicles the life and death of the Cathar movement—one of Western civilization’s most mind-boggling tales.  As he did in his highly praised Back to the Front, Stephen O’Shea brings long-ago events to life though the energy of his prose and the clarity of his insight.  Full of colorful and passionate personalities, his latest book sheds new light on the thirteenth century and on the timelessness of religious intolerance.

This book argues that it can. Specifically, this book argues that the novel and burgeoning discipline of comparative theology is a powerful method for gaining critical insight into our inherited worldviews. More important, it argues that the critical insights gained through comparison can produce constructive theology or, in other words, revised and renewed worldviews. New comparisons produce new questions, and new questions produce new answers. In order to demonstrate the power of this process, the book compares two preeminent theologians, Sri Ramanuja of the Hindu tradition and Friedrich Schleiermacher of the Christian tradition. Each argues that God sustains the universe at every moment of its existence, but they work out the divine sustenance in very different ways. By comparing their description of God's continual preservation of the universe, this book asks original, unfamiliar questions of each. Then, it speculatively suggests possible answers to those questions, inviting Ramanuja and Schleiermacher to respond to the challenges raised. This method demonstrates the incisive power of comparative theology to generate critical tension, as well as the creative power of comparative theology to resolve that very tension.""--Publisher's website.

Help,Garret Keizer,religion,First published in 2004,/works/OL3274373W?edition=ia%3Ahelporiginalhuma00keiz,/authors/OL534399A/Garret_Keizer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9233374M-M.jpg,"Publish Date September 14, 2004|Publisher  HarperSanFrancisco|Language English|Pages 288","In a book the San Francisco Chronicle called ""unclassifiably wise"" and a ""masterpiece,"" noted Harper's essayist Garret Keizer explores the paradox that we are human only by helping others- and all too human when we try to help.It is the primal cry, the first word in a want ad, the last word on the tool bar of a computer screen. A song by the Beatles, a prayer to the gods, the reason Uncle Sam is pointing at you. What we get by with a little of, what we could use a bit more of, what we were only trying to do when we were so grievously misunderstood. What we'll be perfectly fine without, thank you very much.It makes us human. It can make us suffer. It can make us insufferable. It can make all the difference in the world. It can fall short.""Help is like the swinging door of human experience: 'I can help!' we exclaim and go toddling into the sunshine; 'I was no help at all,' we mutter and go shuffling to our graves. I'm betting that the story can be happier than that . . . but I have a clearer idea now than I once did of what I'm betting against.""In his new book, Help, Garret Keizer raises the questions we ask everyday and in every relationship that matters to us. What does it mean to help? When does our help amount to hindrance? When are we getting less help-or more-than we actually want? When are we kidding ourselves in the name of helping (or of refusing to ""enable"") someone else?Drawing from history, literature, firsthand interviews, and personal anecdotes, Help invites us to ponder what is at stake whenever one human being tries to assist another. From the biblical Good Samaritan to present day humanitarians, from heroic sacrifices in times of political oppression to nagging dilemmas in times of ordinary stress, Garret Keizer takes us on a journey that is at once far-ranging and never far from where we live. He reminds us that in our perpetual need for help, and in our frequent perplexities over how and when to give it, we are not alone.

In The Third Jesus, bestselling author and spiritual leader Deepak Chopra provides an answer to this question that is both a challenge to current systems of belief and a fresh perspective on what Jesus can teach us all, regardless of our religious background. There is not one Jesus, Chopra writes, but three.  First, there is the historical Jesus, the man who lived more than two thousand years ago and whose teachings are the foundation of Christian theology and thought. Next there is Jesus the Son of God, who has come to embody an institutional religion with specific dogma, a priesthood, and devout believers. And finally, there is the third Jesus, the cosmic Christ, the spiritual guide whose teaching embraces all humanity, not just the church built in his name. He speaks to the individual who wants to find God as a personal experience, to attain what some might call grace, or God-consciousness, or enlightenment. When we take Jesus literally, we are faced with the impossible. How can we truly ""love thy neighbor as thyself""? But when we see the exhortations of Jesus as invitations to join him on a higher spiritual plane, his words suddenly make sense.  Ultimately, Chopra argues, Christianity needs to overcome its tendency to be exclusionary and refocus on being a religion of personal insight and spiritual growth. In this way Jesus can be seen for the universal teacher he truly is--someone whose teachings of compassion, tolerance, and understanding can embrace and be embraced by all of us.

It is also an enlightening glimpse at the history, folklore, and liturgy of the Celtic people.Esther de Waal introduces readers to monastic prayer and praise (the foundation stone of Celtic Christianity), early Irish litanies, medieval Welsh praise poems, and the wealth of blessings derived from an oral tradition that made prayer a part of daily life. Through this invigorating book, readers enter a world in which ritual and rhythm, nature and seasons, images and symbols play an essential role. A welcome contrast to modern worship, Celtic prayer is liberating and, like a living spring, forever fresh.From the Trade Paperback edition.

It is included in the ancient Indian Mahabharata epic at one of its most dramatic moments, that is, when the final battle is about to begin. In contrast to many other studies, this book deals with the relationship between the Bhagavadgita and its epic contexts. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the text Angelika Malinar argues that its theology delineates not only new philosophical concepts and religious practices but also addresses the problem of righteous kingship and appropriate use of power. Malinar concludes by considering the Bhagavadgita's historical and cultural contexts and those features of the text that became paradigmatic in later Hindu religious traditions.

It uses a series of case studies to explore the development of religious ideas and practices, giving students an understanding of the social, political and historical context. It looks at some familiar themes in the study of religion, such as deity, authoritative texts, myth, worship, teacher traditions and caste, and some of the key ways in which Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism in South Asia have been shaped in the modern period. The book points to the diversity of ways of looking at religious traditions and considers the impact of gender, politics, and the way religion itself is variously understood.""--Publisher's description.

You're not as tall or thin as you'd like, or maybe you don't quite fit in or you just get left out. Well, you'll start to feel a lot better about yourself once you start reading about Luke!  Luke Lang calls himself a freak of nature. He's a grown man who is the height of an average fifth grader---but that's not what makes him a freak. He's also about as wide as the average Sumo wrestler (but sadly, too uncoordinated to actually compete as a Sumo wrestler!). Luke knows what it's like to feel left out or left behind. But he's got a great sense of humor about his life's misadventures, and he's sharing the hysterical stories with you, in the hopes that you'll feel encouraged---not just because you're not as freaky as Luke, but because you'll see that God can do extraordinary things through people who are pretty ordinary.  While you're reading Luke's embarrassing stories, like the time he got beat up by a girl in Karate class or the time he was fighting for his life at Boy Scout camp, you'll learn a little about God's love and grace, and you'll be reminded that you were created on purpose, for a purpose.

Orthodox Christianity and Gender,Helena Kupari,religion,First published in 2019,/works/OL23497937W,/authors/OL8908085A/Helena_Kupari,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Taylor & Francis Group|Language English,"The Orthodox Christian tradition has all too often been sidelined in conversations around contemporary religion. Despite being distinct from Protestantism and Catholicism in both theology and practice, it remains an underused setting for academic inquiry into current lived religious practice. This collection, therefore, seeks to redress this imbalance by investigating modern manifestations of Orthodox Christianity through an explicitly gender-sensitive gaze. By addressing attitudes to gender in this context, it fills major gaps in the literature on both religion and gender. Starting with the traditional teachings and discourses around gender in the Orthodox Church, the book moves on to demonstrate the diversity of responses to those narratives that can be found among Orthodox populations in Europe and North America. Using case studies from several countries, with both large and small Orthodox populations, contributors use an interdisciplinary approach to address how gender and religion interact in contexts such as, iconography, conversion, social activism and ecumenical relations, among others. From Greece and Russia to Finland and the USA, this volume sheds new light on the myriad ways in which gender is manifested, performed, and engaged within contemporary Orthodoxy. Furthermore, it also demonstrates that employing the analytical lens of gender enables new insights into Orthodox Christianity as a lived tradition. It will, therefore, be of great interest to scholars of both Religious Studies and Gender Studies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The story follows a small group through a post-nuclear war future setting, on a quest to rescue a priestess of the goddess Argo from the land of the dark god Hama.  If you're going to start reading his science fiction novels, this would be a good start - or read it after reading several of his later ones and gain an interesting perspective on his evolution as an author.  For a book written in 1962 by a nineteen-year-old, it is imaginative and extraordinary.  Even reading it now and seeing the marks of youth in the author's style, it's a fun story, and you can also notice the gift for description that make Delany's works so vivid.

"American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation",Jon Meacham,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL6032792W?edition=ia%3Aamericangospelgo00meac,/authors/OL1516333A/Jon_Meacham,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8363836M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 4, 2006|Publisher  Random House|Language English|Pages 416","The American Gospel--literally, the good news about America--is that religion shapes our public life without controlling it. In this vivid book, New York Times bestselling author Jon Meacham tells the human story of how the Founding Fathers viewed faith, and how they ultimately created a nation in which belief in God is a matter of choice.At a time when our country seems divided by extremism, American Gospel draws on the past to offer a new perspective. Meacham re-creates the fascinating history of a nation grappling with religion and politics--from John Winthrop's ""city on a hill"" sermon to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence; from the Revolution to the Civil War; from a proposed nineteenth-century Christian Amendment to the Constitution to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call for civil rights; from George Washington to Ronald Reagan.Debates about religion and politics are often more divisive than illuminating. Secularists point to a ""wall of separation between church and state,"" while many conservatives act as though the Founding Fathers were apostles in knee britches. As Meacham shows in this brisk narrative, neither extreme has it right. At the heart of the American experiment lies the God of what Benjamin Franklin called ""public religion,"" a God who invests all human beings with inalienable rights while protecting private religion from government interference. It is a great American balancing act, and it has served us well.Meacham has written and spoken extensively about religion and politics, and he brings historical authority and a sense of hope to the issue. American Gospel makes it compellingly clear that the nation's best chance of summoning what Lincoln called ""the better angels of our nature"" lies in recovering the spirit and sense of the Founding. In looking back, we may find the light to lead us forward.""In his American Gospel, Jon Meacham provides a refreshingly clear, balanced, and wise historical portrait of religion and American politics at exactly the moment when such fairness and understanding are much needed. Anyone who doubts the relevance of history to our own time has only to read this exceptional book.""--David McCullough, author of 1776""Jon Meacham has given us an insightful and eloquent account of the spiritual foundation of the early days of the American republic. It is especially instructive reading at a time when the nation is at once engaged in and deeply divided on the question of religion and its place in public life.""--Tom Brokaw, author of The Greatest Generation""An absorbing narrative full of vivid characters and fresh thinking, American Gospel tells how the Founding Fathers--and their successors--struggled with their own religious and political convictions to work out the basic structure for freedom of religion. For me this book was nonstop reading.""--Elaine Pagels, professor of religion, Princeton University, author of Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas ""Jon Meacham is one of our country's most brilliant thinkers about religion's impact on American society. In this scintillating and provocative book, Meacham reveals the often-hidden influence of religious belief on the Founding Fathers and on later generations of American citizens and leaders up to our own. Today, as we argue more strenuously than ever about the proper place of religion in our politics and the rest of American life, Meacham's important book should serve as the touchstone of the debate."" --Michael Beschloss, author of The Conquerors""At a time when faith and freedom seem increasingly polarized, American Gospel recovers our vital center--the middle ground where, historically, religion and...

Leading biblical scholar Marcus J. Borg offers readers a bold new understanding of scripture that respects both tradition and reality. Covering major portions of both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, Borg demonstrates how important texts such as creation, Adam and Eve, the exodus, the prophets, Job, Ecclesiastes, the gospels, Paul's letters, and Revelation are not primarily historical reports as much as they are vital teaching stories about our relationship with God. Moving away from the narrow literalism that drives so many away from the profound richness of the Bible, this groundbreaking book blends the best of biblical scholarship with a profound concern for authentic faith and how it can be lived today.

""The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."" So begins the psalm that, for millennia, has been a source of comfort in grief and of courage in fear. Now Harold Kushner discovers what it has to teach us about living our day-to-day lives. Each chapter discusses one line of the psalm in the context of both the time when it was written and the present day, and illuminates the life lessons contained within it. For example, Kushner shows us that the phrase ""My cup runneth over"" is a declaration of our gratitude for what life has given us and a rejection of the envy we may feel for what others have. And he draws on the ideas and thoughts of various spiritual figures--from G. K. Chesterton to Martin Buber to Paul Tillich--to further expand our understanding of this great psalm and help us benefit from its everyday spiritual wisdom.From the Hardcover edition.

The religious beliefs of America's founders,Gregg L.

Conservatives and secularists have taken each position respectively, mustering evidence to insist just how tall the wall separating church and state should be. Now Gregg Frazer puts their arguments to rest in the first comprehensive analysis of the Founders' beliefs as they themselves expressed them -- showing that today's political right and left are both wrong. Going beyond church attendance or public pronouncements made for political ends, Frazer scrutinizes the Founders' candid declarations regarding religion found in their private writings. Distilling decades of research, he contends that these men were neither Christian nor deist but rather adherents of a system he labels ""theistic rationalism,"" a hybrid belief system that combined elements of natural religion, Protestantism, and reason -- with reason the decisive element. Frazer explains how this theological middle ground developed, what its core beliefs were, and how they were reflected in the thought of eight Founders: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington. He argues convincingly that Congregationalist Adams is the clearest example of theistic rationalism; that presumed deists Jefferson and Franklin are less secular than supposed; and that even the famously taciturn Washington adheres to this theology. He also shows that the Founders held genuinely religious beliefs that aligned with morality, republican government, natural rights, science, and progress. Frazer's careful explication helps readers better understand the case for revolutionary recruitment, the religious references in the Declaration of Independence, and the religious elements -- and lack thereof -- in the Constitution. He also reveals how influential clergymen, backing their theology of theistic rationalism with reinterpreted Scripture, preached and published liberal democratic theory to justify rebellion. - Publisher.

Putnam's sons,"This is the second of four courses of American lectures on the ""History of Religions,"" two of which have been delivered, and the remaining two of which will be delivered in 1898 and 1899. Professor Brinton is second to none as an authority on primitive cults. He enunciates the theory that primitive religions emanate from the universal belief that behind natural phenomena lies the ""ultimate, invisible, immeasurable power of mind, of conscious will, of intelligence, analogous in some way to our own ; and"" he adds, ""mark this essential corollary, -- that man is in communication with it."" He insists on the term ""religion"" being applied ""to the grossest rites of barbarism"" as much as ""to the refined ceremonies of Christian churches,"" and, moreover, is highly contemptuous of writers, such as Spencer and Lubbock, who assert that races exist with no religions ideas -- no such races are known. Professor Brinton also quotes with approval Bachanan's dictum that the similarity of religions beliefs is due to the identity in the mental construction of man; and also Hartland's observation that man's imagination ever works by fixed laws. Religions of Primitive Peoples is a wonderfully interesting and impressive little book. It puts with the clearest and most incisive expression the views of one who has studied closely the American races, and it draws attention to the beauty and grandeur of primitive beliefs. The ordinary reader views the savage as a very dirty and rather picturesque individual, and is quite unaware of the poetical beauties of the savage's imagination. We advise our readers to peruse Professor Brinton's work, which is studded with little gems of apposite quotation from the beliefs of savages and is by no means technical, but a most readable, fascinating book. - The Spectator, 1 October 1898.

It arises out of the University of Bristol's Centre for Buddhist Studies research project Buddhist Death Rituals in Southeast Asia and China, funded by the United Kingdom's Arts and Humanities Research Council. This project involved extensive new research in Thailand, Laos and China. Other items from that project included several public exhibitions, extensive stills photographs, and several video films. The project-team produced two 30 minutes films on the ghost festival in Laos and China, one on urban funerals in Chiang Mai (Thailand) and several shorter clips dealing with funeral cultures in Laos, Thailand and China.

Nevertheless most of us know far more of Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and the classical deities. Recent researches in archaeology and mythology have added to what was already a fairly consistent picture (largely derived from a twelfth-century Icelandic account) of the principal Scandinavian gods and godesses. This study is the work of a scholar who has long specialized in Norse and Germanic mythology. She describes the more familiar gods of war, of fertility, of the sky and the sea and the dead, and also discusses those most puzzling figures of Norse mythology – Heimdall, Balder and Loki.  All these deities were worshipped in the Viking Age, and the author has endeavoured to relate their cults to daily life and to see why these pagan beliefs gave way in time to the Christian faith.  Hilda Ellis Davidson studied Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse under the Chadwicks at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she took Firsts in English Literature and what was then known as Archaeology and Anthropology. She received her Ph.D. in 1940 for a thesis on beliefs about the dead in Old Norse literature. She lectured in English Language and Literature at Royal Holloway College and BirkBeck College in the University of London, and was elected a Fellow of the Society of the Antiquaries in 1950. In 1973 she became a Fellow of Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, where she was Vice-President from 1975 until 1980. She was president of the Folklore Society from 1973 to 1976, and General Editor of the nineteen Mistletoe Books published between 1974 and 1984. She is married with two children, and ten grandchildren, and lives in Cambridge.   Read more Read less",27 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His classic national bestseller, Jesus, is a powerful and controversial portrait of a courageous revolutionary, philosopher, and political agitator who challenged the prevailing rules of the social order. Bold, moving, and provocative, a book that will affect every Christian reader deeply and profoundly, Jesus is a remarkable work that presents a very different view of a savior and king of peace who proclaimed-in thought and action-that all may participate in the rule of God.

Moving away from dominant discourses that discuss women as a single monolithic, homogenous category--thus rendering them invisible within the broader religious discourse--this monograph examines their sustained role in the larger context of South Asian Buddhism and reaffirms their agency. It highlights the multiple roles played by women as patrons, practitioners, lay and monastic members, etc. within Buddhism. The volume also investigates the individual experiences of the members, and their equations and relationships at different levels--with the Samgha at large, with their own respective Bhikşu or Bhikşunī Sangha, with the laity, and with members of the same gender (both lay and monastic). It rereads, reconfigures and reassesses historical data in order to arrive at a new understanding of Buddhism and the social matrix within which it developed and flourished.

Satisfaction. Happiness. Joy. The pursuit of pleasure in God is not only permissible; it’s essential.  Building his message on hundreds of Scriptures, especially from the Psalms, the apostle Paul, and Jesus himself—and echoing the likes of Blaise Pascal, Jonathan Edwards, and C.S. Lewis—Piper beckons us to approach God with the hedonist’s abandon. Finally, we are freed to enjoy Jesus not only as our Lord and Savior, but also our all-surpassing, soul-satisfying Treasure.  As important today as ever, Desiring God may turn your Christian world upside down. And that will be a good thing, for the glory of God, and for your deepest joy.

The Great Mother,Erich Neumann,religion,First published in 1955,/works/OL10483484W?edition=ia%3Agreatmotheranal00neum,/authors/OL4349254A/Erich_Neumann,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6178003M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1955|Publisher  Pantheon Books|Language English|Pages 380,"Neumann examines how the Feminine has been experienced and expressed in many cultures from prehistory to our own time.     Appearing as goddess and demon, gate and pillar, garden and tree, hovering sky and containing vessel, the Feminine is seen as an essential factor in the dialectical relation of individual consciousness, symbolized by the child, to the ungraspable matrix, symbolized by the Great Mother.  Erich Neumann,was a psychologist, philosopher, writer, and student of Carl Jung.  Career    Neumann was born in Berlin to a Jewish family.[1] He received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1927 and then continued to study medicine at the University of Berlin, where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933. In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julia, who had been Zionists since they were teenagers, moved to Tel Aviv.[1] For many years, he regularly returned to Zürich, Switzerland to give lectures at the C. G. Jung Institute. He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the International Association for Analytical Psychology and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death from kidney cancer in 1960.[1]  Contributions    Neumann contributed to the field of developmental psychology and the psychology of consciousness and creativity. He had a theoretical and philosophical approach to analysis, contrasting with the more clinical concern in England and the United States. His most valuable contribution to psychology was the empirical concept of ""centroversion"", a synthesis of extra- and introversion. However, he is best known for his theory of feminine development, a theory formulated in numerous publications, most notably The Great Mother. His works also elucidate the way mythology throughout history reveals aspects of the development of consciousness that are parallel in both the individual and society as a whole.  Jordan B. Peterson: Erich Neumann is the most well-regarded student, analyst & distiller of Carl Jung's work.   Read more Read less",11 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet the greatness of Hinduismits vitality, its earthiness, its vividnesslies precisely in many of those idiosyncratic qualities that continue to inspire debate today.Wendy Doniger is one of the foremost scholars of Hinduism in the world. With her inimitable insight and expertise Doniger illuminates those moments within the tradition that resist forces that would standardize or establish a canon. Without reversing or misrepresenting the historical hierarchies, she reveals how Sanskrit and vernacular sources are rich in knowledge of and compassion toward women and lower castes; how they debate tensions surrounding religion, violence, and tolerance; and how animals are the key to important shifts in attitudes toward different social classes.The Hindus brings a fascinating multiplicity of actors and stories to the stage to show how brilliant and creative thinkersmany of them far removed from Brahmin authors of Sanskrit textshave kept Hinduism alive in ways that other scholars have not fully explored. In this unique and authoritative account, debates about Hindu traditions become platforms from which to consider the ironies, and overlooked epiphanies, of history.

Knowing God presents an innovative analysis of one of the most difficult and intractable philosophical questions of the past 350 years: the problem of knowledge, and specifically knowledge of God and the transcendental principles of value. This book situates the problem within the context of current social and political struggles, as well as within the contemporary search for meaning and value. Mansueto revisits ancient debates regarding the agent intellect, intentional being, and connatural knowledge, while drawing on recent discussions in neuropsychology (Luria and Damasio), cognitive development theory (Piaget and Luria), and the sociology of knowledge or ""ideological criticism"" (especially Durkheim, Lukacs, and Gramsci). Including a chapter on forms of religious knowledge and concluding with a 'guide for the perplexed' intended to help overcome nihilism and despair, Knowing God reconciles epistemological and metaphysical realism with a recognition of the role of social structure in shaping knowledge.""--Provided by publisher.

Stark asks, why a variety of world religions all sprang up at about the same time (referred to as the Axial Age). And Stark asks, why do many religions seem to share similar features? As the title suggests, Stark's thesis will be that god was here all along, and humans ""discovered"" (not invented) god in keeping with their own intellectual and spiritual evolution.

Many activists on the right maintain that the United States was founded as a ""Christian nation."" Many on the left contend that the Founders were secular or Deist and that the First Amendment was designed to boldly separate church and state throughout the land. None of these claims are true, argues Beliefnet.com editor in chief Steven Waldman. With refreshing objectivity, Waldman narrates the real story of how our nation's Founders forged a new approach to religious liberty, a revolutionary formula that promoted faith . . . by leaving it alone.This fast-paced narrative begins with earlier settlers' stunningly unsuccessful efforts to create a Christian paradise, and concludes with the presidencies of Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison, during which the men who had devised lofty principles regarding the proper relationship between church and state struggled to practice what they'd preached. We see how religion helped cause, and fuel, the Revolutionary War, and how the surprising alliance between Enlightenment philosophers such as Jefferson and Madison and evangelical Christians resulted in separation of church and state.As the drama unfolds, Founding Faith vividly describes the religious development of five Founders. Benjamin Franklin melded the morality-focused Puritan theology of his youth and the reason-based Enlightenment philosophy of his adulthood. John Adams's pungent views on religion--hatred of the Church of England and Roman Catholics--stoked his revolutionary fervor and shaped his political strategy. George Washington came to view religious tolerance as a military necessity. Thomas Jefferson pursued a dramatic quest to ""rescue"" Jesus, in part by editing the Bible. Finally, it was James Madison--the tactical leader of the battle for religious freedom--who crafted an integrated vision of how to prevent tyranny while encouraging religious vibrancy.The spiritual custody battle over the Founding Fathers and the role of religion in America continues today. Waldman provocatively argues that neither side in the culture war has accurately depicted the true origins of the First Amendment. He sets the record straight, revealing the real history of religious freedom to be dramatic, unexpected, paradoxical, and inspiring.An interactive library of the key writings by the Founding Father, on separation of church and state, personal faith, and religious liberty can be found at www.beliefnet.com/foundingfaith.Praise for Founding Faith""Steven Waldman, a veteran journalist and co-founder of Beliefnet.com, a religious web site, surveys the convictions and legacy of the founders clearly and fairly, with a light touch but a careful eye.""--New York Times Book Review""Waldman ends by encouraging us to be like the founders. We should understand their principles, learn from their experience, then have at it ourselves. ""We must pick up the argument that they began and do as they instructed -- use our reason to determine our views."" A good place to start is this entertaining, provocative book.""--New York Times Book Review""Steven Waldman's enlightening new book, ""Founding Faith,"" is wise and engaging on many levels, but Waldman has done a particular service in detailing Madison's role in creating a culture of religious freedom that has served America so well for so long....""Founding Faith"" is an excellent book about an important subject: the inescapable--but manageable--intersection of religious belief and public life. With a grasp of history and an understanding of the exigencies of the moment, Waldman finds a middle ground...   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In The Jesus Papers, Michael Baigent reveals the truth about Jesus's life and crucifixion. Despite -- or rather because of -- all the celebration and veneration that have surrounded the figure of Jesus for centuries, Baigent asserts that Jesus and the circumstances leading to his death have been heavily mythologized.As a religious historian and a leading expert in the field of arcane knowledge, Baigent has unequaled access to hidden archives, secret societies, Masonic records, and the private collections of antiquities traders and their moneyed clients. Using that access to full advantage, Baigent explores the religious and political climate in which Jesus was born and raised, examining not only the conflicts between the Romans and the Jews, but the strife within the different factions of the Jewish Zealot movement. He chronicles the migrations of Jesus's family, his subsequent exposure to other cultures, and the events, teachings, and influences that were most likely to have shaped his early years. Baigent also uncovers the inconsistencies and biases in the accounts of the major historians of Jesus's time, including Josephus, Pliny, and Tacitus. The enduring influence of these accounts in forming our most common conceptions of Jesus reveals that spin is not a new phenomenon.Taking us back to sites that over the last twenty years he has meticulously explored, studied, and in some instances excavated for the first time, Baigent provides a detailed account of his groundbreaking discoveries, including many never-before-seen photos. The evidence he has uncovered has lead him to make shocking new assertions that threaten the conventional account of Jesus's life and death and shake the very foundation of Western thought, based as it is upon the assumption of Jesus's divinity. Ultimately, his investigation raises the hope that we may gain a new understanding of Jesus.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

It examines both the substantive and functional definitions of religion that are more open, pluralistic, and not inscribed in a single explanatory horizon or within a single confessional perspective. The contributors' concerns are carefully written to show all sides of the argument. Roberto Cipriani argues for the simple definition that the sociology of religion is an application of sociological theories and methods to religious phenomena. Historically, close ties between sociology and the sociology of religion exist. The slow and uneven development of theory and methods affects the sociology of religion's development, but the latter has also benefited from increasing precision and scientific validity. Other sociological writers agree and disagree about different approaches. Some assume it is a militantly confessional or anti-confessional; others remain neutral within their work.""--Provided by publisher.

Preachers of Hate,Kenneth R.

The ""new"" anti-Semitism targets not only Jews, but Americans specifically and the West in general. It targets our values, our lifestyle, and our freedoms. It is the single most important issue we face when trying to make sense of the Arab world.Most Americans will be stunned to discover the depth and extent of anti-Semitic hatred in today's Middle East and Europe, and that many Muslim leaders are not just encouraging it, but spending a great deal of money to spread the lies that spawned the terrorists responsible for the September 11 attack on America. In Preachers of Hate, bestselling author Kenneth R. Timmerman (who is not Jewish) contends that, besides Islam itself, the core unifying force in the Muslim world is a virulent strain of anti-Semitism that postulates the existence of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. From the pulpits of fiery Muslim clerics to the Arab street, and to the highest reaches of government and state-sponsored media, there is a belief that this thousand-year-old conspiracy has already taken hold in America and is now, especially after the war in Iraq, about to do the same in the Middle East and beyond. It is seen as no less than Muslims' historical destiny to prevent such a takeover, and to do so by any means possible. To misunderstand the ferocity of that belief is to vastly underestimate the resolve of many Muslims to repel America, Israel, and all things Western.Timmerman explores the roots of this hatred, examining its history, the religious sources upon which it draws, and how it is being transmitted to young people growing up in Arab societies by their leaders, their teachers, and their mosques. He documents how U.S. and European Union money has been used to finance hatred in Palestinian schools. He exposes the double-talk of Arab leaders and their supporters in the West. As it so often was throughout history, this new strain of Jew hatred is really about much more than Jews. They get attacked first, when the enemies of America can't attack Americans. However, what begins with the Jews never ends with the Jews.""Is there a conspiracy between America and the Jews?"" asks Timmerman. ""Indeed there is: A common heritage, a dedication to improving the human condition through compassion and tolerance of differences--a conspiracy of freedom. And that is why they hate us."" As with the Jews throughout history, America has been ""unfairly successful."" As have the Jews, Americans have ""profited"" from the misery and poverty of others. If you hate Jews, you must also hate America. Such is the simple logic of the anti-Semite. Such, increasingly, is the logic of the Middle East. It is a message that is reinforced day in and day out by the official government-sanctioned Arab media, from the streets of Egypt, London, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Paris, and Gaza, and in the mosques where impassioned clerics quote verbatim texts like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a pillar of anti-Semitic hatred that originated in czarist Russia.As America reasserts her role in the Middle East and attempts to bring peace between Jews and Arabs, Preachers of Hate is an essential book that reframes a very complicated issue as a matter of life and death.From the Hardcover edition.

In the land - gift, promise, and challenge - was found the physical source of Israel's fertility and life, and a place for the gathering of the hopes of the covenant people. In this careful treatment, Walter Brueggemann follows the development of his theme through the major blocks of Israel's traditions. The book provides a point of entrance both to the theology of the Old Testament and to aspects of the New Testament - even as it illuminates crucial issues of the contemporary scene, Recurring problems with border conflicts, soil and water pollution, and homelessness prompt the author's reflections on the relation between the biblical traditions and our contemporary dilemmas.    In this fully revised edition of a classic work, Brueggemann provides new insights in an additional chapter, as well as updating the discussion, notes, and bibliography.

In God Has a Dream, his most soul-searching book, he shares the spiritual message that guided him through those troubled times. Drawing on personal and historical examples, Archbishop Tutu reaches out to readers of all religious backgrounds, showing how individual and global suffering can be transformed into joy and redemption. With his characteristic humor, Tutu offers an extremely personal and liberating message. He helps us to ""see with the eyes of the heart"" and to cultivate the qualities of love, forgiveness, humility, generosity, and courage that we need to change ourselves and our world.  Echoing the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., he writes, ""God says to you, 'I have a dream.  Please help me to realize it.  It is a dream of a world whose ugliness and squalor and poverty, its war and hostility, its greed and harsh competitiveness, its alienation and disharmony are changed into their glorious counterparts.  When there will be more laughter, joy, and peace, where there will be justice and goodness and compassion and love and caring and sharing.  I have a dream that my children will know that they are members of one family, the human family, God's family, my family.'"" Addressing the timeless and universal concerns all people share, God Has a Dream envisions a world transformed through hope and compassion, humility and kindness, understanding and forgiveness.

Ray Billington, renowned for his direct and accessible writing, considers how far Western religious and philosophical thinking can be enriched by the ideas of India and China. Understanding Eastern Philosophy is both a comprehensive overview of, and an outstanding introduction to, the key philosophies of the East and how they compare with those of the West. Ray Billington clearly presents the key tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Jainism, Yin and Yang, and Confucianism, comparing and contrasting them with Western religions.Understanding Eastern Philosophy is also a response to increasing doubt in the West about the value of formal expressions of religious belief, and the concurrent search for other sources offering a spiritual dimension to life. Ray Billington challenges theism, particularly Christianity, with its belief in a personal God bestowing a certain version of 'truth', and rejects the idea of the immortality of the soul. Teasing out the central themes of religious philosophy, he concludes that a belief in the spiritual is essential and that the universal mysticism characteristic of Eastern thought provides a more realistic and rewarding path than is commonly supposed in the West.

This book presents one of these interpretations by the celebrated Indian Buddhist philosopher, Candrakīrti (ca. 570-650 C.E.). Candrakīrti's theory is part of the ""Introduction to the Middle Way"" (""Madhyamakāvatāra""), which is the central treatise upon which the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) School of Indian Buddhist philosophy was developed. In this book, the text is translated and provided with an introduction and commentary, which offers a careful analysis and historical context on Candrakīrti's account of the selflessness of persons. A philosophical analysis of an ancient Indian philosophical text that is both philologically precise and analytically sophisticated, this book is of interest to scholars of Buddhism generally and Buddhist philosophy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Developed with the student and pastor in view, it will be an indispensable help for rapid reading of the Hebrew text. The Reader's Lexicon eliminates most of the time-consuming lexical work needed for basic translation. Words that occur fifty times or less in the Old Testament are listed verse by verse in the order of their occurrence. An appendix lists all words that occur more than fifty times. Definitions are based on Brown, Driver, and Briggs's Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, but they have also been checked against the text for meaning in context. The number at the end of the entry gives the page number in BDB where the definitions may be found. Along with the definitions of the Hebrew words are their respective frequencies both in the given book and in the whole Old Testament. - Jacket flap.

Every gift you have---your instincts to lead and your passion to make a difference--- came from the hand of a loving Father who crafted you.  In this practical and inspiring book, Willow Creek executive vice president and teaching pastor Nancy Beach speaks to women with God-given gifts of leading and teaching. Sharing from her thirty-year journey in a local church, Nancy offers guidance on such issues as:      developing character     earning respect     finding your voice for leadership and teaching     managing work and personal life     forming an intentional support network, and more.  She also challenges church leaders to wrestle with the issue of women in leadership, and to be advocates for women as they seek to reach their full ministry potential.  My prayer is that you will fully engage in the dangerous and thrilling adventure of using your leadership gift to advance the kingdom of God. The path won't be easy. . . but God will never leave you alone. So trust him. And don't forget to enjoy the ride!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this book, the complex and dual     relationship between the media and new religions  is  investigated  by  looking  at  the  tensions      groups  face  between  the need  for  visibility  and  the  risks  of  facing  attacks  and      criticism  through  the media.  Indeed,  media  and  new  technologies  have  been  extensively      used  by religious groups not only to spread their messages and to try to reach a wider audience,     but also to promote themselves as a highly modern and up-to-date form of religion appropriate for a     modern technological age. In the 1980s and early 1990s, some movements, such as Agonsh?, K?fuku no     Kagaku and Aum Shinriky?, came into prominence especially via the use of media (initially pub-     lications, but also ritual broadcasts, advertising campaigns and public media events). This created     new modes of ritual engagement and new ways of inter- actions between leaders and members. The aim     of this book is to develop and illustrate particular key issues in the wider new religions and     media nexus by using specific movements as examples. In particular, the analysis of the inter-     action  between  media  and  new  religions  will  focus  primarily  on  three  case studies     predominantly during the first period of development of the groups.

Max's teaching and storytelling skills engage and encourage your commitment to daily enter into the presence of the giver of all good things, your Father. Turn is striking a chord in hearts and souls across America --bringing, one by one, a nation back to the Foundation on which it was built. Turn back to God...  Who daily sustains your very existence,  and is the sole source of your every blessing.  Who showers our country with grace,  creating this nation for his name's sake.  From your life to your land, his hand of mercy is upon you. It's time now to turn and ask, ""What can I do for God?""  He's waiting for you.  He's waiting for America .  Story Behind the BookUsing fresh stories and original Bible teaching, 2005 National Day of Prayer spokesman Max Lucado joins seasoned author and pastor Brian Smith to call readers to a life of active prayer-guided dependence on God. The authors' compelling, compassionate approach will cultivate hearts that truly beat for God, moving the reader from ""ought"" to ""want"" in prayer and daily surrender to Him. Turn serves as a strategic tool, urging our nation toward spiritual renewal.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It considers how virtual experiences, like stories, games and rituals, are forms of world-building or ""cosmos construction"" that serve as a means of making sense of our own world. Such creative and interactive activity is, arguably, patently religious. This book examines: the nature of sacred space in virtual contexts; technology as a vehicle for sacred texts; who we are when we go online; what rituals have in common with games and how they work online; what happens to community when people worship online; how religious ""worlds"" and virtual ""worlds"" nurture similar desires. Rachel Wagner suggests that whilst our engagement with virtual reality can be viewed as a form of religious activity, today's virtual religion marks a radical departure from traditional religious practice -- it is ephemeral, transient, rapid, disposable, hyper-individualized, hybrid, and in an ongoing state of flux. - Publisher.

Contributing authors, who include both national and international experts in the fields of human-animal connection and trauma, discuss how our relationships with animals can help build resiliency and foster healing to transform trauma and trauma response.
