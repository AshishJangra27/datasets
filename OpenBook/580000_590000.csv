Its shallow, slowly flowing waters create an ecosystem of mysterious beauty with a great diversity of plant and animal life. This book documents the beauty of the Everglades for young readers in text and color photos.  But the Everglades ecosystem is in trouble, and it is all about the water. People have ditched, diked, diverted, and drained the water. Plant and animal populations are declining at an alarming rate. The quality of life for people in south Florida is also at risk. Destroy the Everglades—destroy the water system of south Florida.  Can we save the Everglades? Reverse the environmental abuse? Protect the aquifers that hold the water underground? No one really knows. The most recent effort, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP)—the largest environmental restoration plan ever undertaken on Earth—has gained global attention. The massive plan, which is expected to take at least 35 years to complete and cost many billions of dollars, covers an 18,000-square-mile area and requires many groups to work together.  Can CERP save the Everglades and south Florida? You can decide for yourself after reading this book.  One thing you will learn for sure: The Everglades is worth saving.  Ages 11–14.

As a young man, he found a path in politics and quickly began to move into the public eye. That ascent seemed impossible when he contracted polio and lost the use of his legs.

We may shrug our shoulders to show we don't care, or open our eyes wide in surprise, or give the thumbs up to show we approve of something.

The story, told in reverse, begins with thirty-six-year-old Theo and his search for sexual and emotional freedom, and slowly unravels back to a childhood of abuse in the juvenile detention centers of Chicago. Without judgment, Elliott traces a life defined by yearning-for love, for pain, for certainty. His clear words and unflinching gaze reveal the difficulty of simple truths and the possibility of transcendence in the face of unforgivable crimes."" About the author: Stephen Elliott lives in San Francisco and lectures at Stanford University. He was born in Chicago, and was a Ward of the State of Illinois from age thirteen to eighteen.

When Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, inherited the throne in 1894, he was unprepared to do so. With their four daughters (including Anastasia) and only son, a hemophiliac, Nicholas and his reclusive wife, Alexandra, buried their heads in the sand, living a life of opulence as World War I raged outside their door and political unrest grew into the Russian Revolution. Deftly maneuvering between the lives of the Romanovs and the plight of Russia's peasants and urban workers--and their eventual uprising--Fleming offers up a fascinating portrait, complete with inserts featuring period photographs and compelling primary-source material that brings it all to life.  Using period photographs, compelling primary-source material, and riveting text, this book shares the story of Russia's Nicholas II and his wife, who lived in opulence as World War I raged on.

In just a few minutes, you can fold a sheet of paper and create something to play with right away. If a child can fold a piece of paper, he or she can learn the basics of origami. Plus, once a project is finished, it's fun to decorate and play with the object created.  The expert author Didier Boursin demonstrates folds in easy, individual steps using clear, colorful drawings and engaging photographs of kids making origami models like a boat, a fish and an airplane. Only seven types of folds are used in the entire book, and a visual glossary at the beginning shows what each fold instruction means. Some of the projects have only three or four folds.  There are 16 origami projects that are simple and fun to make. They include: a sailboat that moves forward, a diary for keeping secrets, an airplane that's ready for takeoff, blow-up balls for juggling, a toy that does somesaults.  All you need are a few simple sheets of paper, a pair of scissors and a good imagination. Folding for Fun makes this ancient art accessible by turning it into a playful and rewarding activity that also produces a toy.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The idea that that atoms joined to form structures called molecules first appeared in the 19th century and helped explain why gases, liquids, and solids behave differently from one another. In the 20th century subatomic particles were discovered-electrons, protons, and neutrons-and atomic structure was finally understood. These breakthroughs led to the development of quantum theory and quantum mechanics. This book details the inspiring and heroic discovery, delving deeply into intriguing stories, reviewing major scientific landmarks, and introducing readers to the vivid men and women who helped discover and map the microscopic universe that is the atom.

Historical backgrounds are sketched in, but along with describing each malady's causes and effects, the authors focus chiefly on current incidence, treatments, public awareness campaigns, and research toward cures. Except for several stomach-churning photos of victims in Fighting Smallpox, the illustrations are largely generic, less-than-informative depictions of lab scientists sporting white coats, Third World residents, and melodramatic graphic representations of viruses. Aside from Fighting Cancer-which contains alarmist generalizations about cell phone radiation, a sweeping claim that ""men under the age of 30 are particularly at risk from testicular cancer,"" and an observation that breast removal, à la Angelina Jolie, is an effective preventive measure-these titles nonetheless make serviceable complements and updates for the equivalent titles in Rosen's 2010 series ""Epidemics and Society.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the hot savannah plains of Africa to the freezing cold South Pole, from soaring in the sky to living near a pond, each diary is an amazing insight into an animal's life. This series' unique approach is that the diaries are not written by a human, but by the animals themselves, charting their lives from birth to maturity with all the adventures that happen in between. Each book is a mixture of diary entries, informative extracts, sketches and fact-filled animal profile cards. Books are packed full of interesting information on the animals' habitat, diet, different stages of life and interaction with other animals. Incredibly vivid illustrations let young readers feel like they are immersed in the lives of the diarists, and may encourage them to start documenting their own adventures.""--Publisher's description.

The book tells how two curious children and their grandparents re-create eclipses in their living room using a lamp, a tennis ball, two Hula Hoops, and Ping-Pong balls. Later, in the backyard and around the house, the family explores safe ways to view a solar eclipse and ponders phenomena from sunspots to phases of the Moon. Written by the authors of NSTA's award-winning book Solar Science, When the Sun Goes Dark gives children and adults hands-on techniques for learning the science behind eclipses of the Sun and Moon. --Publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With child services on Kendall's case and just 10 days to get her apartment lease renewed, Kendall sets out for Janet's home in New Orleans to get her life in order--and her questions answered.But what she finds are new friends, like Evie, who is confined to a wheelchair, but can sing like the women on G'ma's old records; Miss Clare, who needs Kendall's help as much as Kendall needs hers; and Marcus, who is younger than them all, but still knows how to get by.
