Then, in the span of one week, a sudden layoff and the events of 9/11 plunged Evans into a crushing depression. At turns poignant and uproarious, Rage Against the Meshugenah vividly traces Evans' journey through the minefield of mental illness from a modern man's point-of-view, including his no-holds-barred confrontations with infuriating sexual side effects, self-medication with beer and porn, and a therapist named Neil Diamond.Danny Evans is here to tell readers the truth about depression, in his own unique style. Skillfully combining self-deprecating humor, absurdly ridiculous insights, and astute pop culture references, Evans reveals his universal struggle to make himself feel happy in a world gone mad, and he's willing to let readers in on his rollercoaster ride of laugher, tears and a whole lot of meshugenah.

After watching a tv program about Otzi, a 5,000-year-old ""Ice Man,"" Kit's friend Ike becomes convinced that Kit's destiny is to become the next ice man—a source of information for future generations. Together they obtain artifacts they think will accurately reflect life in the early twenty-first century and plan their journey to a nearby mountain. Kit gets tattoos similar to Otzi's, writes a manifesto and tries to come to terms with making the ultimate sacrifice. As he grows more and more agitated and isolated, his family and friends suspect that something is terribly wrong, but before they can discover the true severity of the situation, Kit and Ike set off on what could be their last journey.

DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION: A STUDY OF PREVALENCE IN AN ELDERLY RESIDENTIAL SETTING,Geraldine Fahy Marrocco,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12280945W,/authors/OL5370044A/Geraldine_Fahy_Marrocco,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 134,"Depression and dementia are the most frequent psychiatric disorders in the elderly. A review of the literature reveals a lack of sufficient detection of the dementia syndrome of depression by primary care providers. Depressive symptoms are masked by cognitive impairment and also by somatic complaints. These complaints frequently lead to expensive diagnostic tests and unnecessary pharmaceutical intervention. Cognitive impairment in the elderly is often the first symptom of depression, that when identified and treated with appropriate intervention, is a reversible disorder. Untreated, it becomes a permanent irreversible dementia.  The purpose of this study was to determine if the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a community residential setting was higher than reported in studies involving the aged. The subjects were 75 years of age and older living in an independent community in Fairfield County, CT. A non-randomized cross sectional design of 111 subjects participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Data were collected using the Mini Mental Status Exam, the Geriatric Depression Scale (short form) and a sociodemographic data questionnaire.  The results of this study found that the prevalence of depression was 12.6% and the prevalence of cognitive impairment was 7.2%. There was a significant correlation (r = $-$.3226, p $<$.001) between depression and cognitive impairment. When demographic variables were examined with depression, there was a significant correlation between depression and number of somatic complaints (r =.263, p $<$.01), age, total number of losses and use of benzodiazepines. For cognitive functioning, the only significant variables having an independent effect on cognitive functioning were depression and a composite score of social involvement.  This study demonstrated that the prevalence of depressive symptoms is higher than previously reported. Also depressive symptoms are significantly correlated to cognitive functioning, somatic complaints, age, losses, the diagnosis of cancer and benzodiazepine use. There was no significant correlation between depression and education, marital status, alcohol use, previous history of depression or number of chronic illnesses. The study found that regardless of depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning was significantly correlated with social participation.  There are implications for health education as it relates to disease prevention. The findings emphasize a need for a thorough epidemiological diagnosis noting mental health problems of the elderly. The study recommends future research and concludes with an examination of risk factors for depression with suggestions for primary providers to enhance case finding in the elderly.

WOMEN AFTER WAR: VIETNAM EXPERIENCES AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS: CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT PROBLEMS OF RED CROSS WORKERS AND MILITARY NURSES,Maxine Salvatore,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12279728W,/authors/OL5368974A/Maxine_Salvatore,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 221,"Despite the widespread attention given to male Vietnam veterans, the two largest groups of women to serve in Vietnam, an estimated 11,000 military women and an unknown number of Red Cross workers, have been the subject of only limited research. This study describes the unique experiences and reactions of women Red Cross workers and military nurses, exploring in particular the relationships between Vietnam experiences and PTSD symptoms and PTSD symptoms and later adjustment problems.  The sample (n = 335) of 233 Red Cross workers and 102 military nurses responded to a mailed questionnaire. Measures for Vietnam experiences, PTSD symptoms and demographic data were developed for this study. The CES-D scale for depressive symptoms and the Social Adjustment Scale were also utilized.  Experiences of women in Vietnam included loss, exposure to danger, sexual harassment, and inadequate preparation for war. The extremely youthful Red Cross and military women were exposed to catastrophic danger. Nurses were more likely to come in contact with large numbers of injured and dying, to feel responsible for another's death, and to report shortages of essential personnel and supplies. Red Cross workers reported more frequent sexual harassment. Both groups suffered PTSD symptoms with nurses showing more short term effects and more frequent nightmares and alcohol problems. Disruption and loss of relationships through death or disappearance, feeling responsible for the death of another, denial of emotions, inadequate preparation for Vietnam and sexual harassment contributed to PTSD symptoms. Status as nurse or Red Cross worker did not contribute to PTSD symptoms. In 1987 a third of the group reported depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and vulnerability to social adjustment problems. PTSD symptoms contributed to social adjustment difficulties with mates, children, families, friends and at work.  Results point to needed program and policy changes in the following organizations: the American Red Cross to institute adequate preparation of war zone workers; Armed Forces to eliminate sexual harassment; VA to develop programs and policies focused on women. Provision of care for civilian volunteers with war-related problems and full acknowledgement of both groups' service in Vietnam remain to be achieved.

The purposes of the research were to (a) describe the level of hope in a sample of noninstitutionalized elderly and (b) identify the relationship between selected factors (social support, health, age, level of education, socioeconomic status, and religious well-being) and the level of hope in the sample. Using a nonprobability convenience sampling method, 169 individuals age 65-94 residing outside of formal institutions were selected to participate in the study. Data were collected using the Demographic Profile, Miller Hope Scale, Personal Resource Questionnaire-85--Part 2, and the Religious Well-being Scale. A fairly high level of hope was found among the subjects in this study. Significant positive correlations were found between hope and the factors of health, social support, and religious well-being; no significant correlations were found between hope and the factors of age, level of education, and socioeconomic status. Overall, the best predictors of the level of hope among the subjects were social support, health, and religious well-being.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His journey has, until now, never been told. In the winter of 1979, aged just twenty-seven, the inmate who would come to be known as 'Charlie Bronson' was considered uncontrollable by the prison system. Certified insane, he was transferred from Parkhurst Prison to the most infamous high-security psychiatric hospital in England, Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. There he embarked on a one-man campaign to retain his sanity, and to fight against the brutality of a largely hidden regime that relied on enforced drug control. This outstandingly honest account takes the reader back to those dark days. It is a journey filled with sadness, and yet it is one that includes much laughter and pathos, as well as detailing the camaraderie among fellow patients, who included Ronnie Kray and Frankie Fraser. How Charlie Bronson survived Broadmoor, what he endured and the things he witnessed are, for the very first time, documented in this sad, often chilling, sometimes funny and often moving account of one man's journey into madness and his methods for surviving the UK's most feared and notorious psychiatric hospital. Capturing Bronson's unique voice, it is a roller-coaster ride of madness, pain, laughter and tears. It is also a testament to one man's triumph over adversity.""--Publisher description.

What is therapy? What kinds of therapy are available? How do I know if I need therapy? In the video, several adolescent therapists address these and other questions. Various teens with common issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse and bullying, speak on camera about their experiences with therapy. Provides viewers with guidelines for recognizing if they need intervention--signs like persistent negative feelings, realizing that your life is off track, experiencing a traumatic event such as the death of a loved one and worries that you might have a psychological disorder. Program also explores how to choose a therapist and what kind of therapist to choose. The video's message is clear: seeking therapy is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of bravery and courage for those who choose to address issues that may be holding them back.""--Publisher description.

""Philosopher, ethicist, and psychoanalyst Nancy Sherman explores the psychological and moral burdens borne by soldiers. By illuminating the extent to which wars are fought internally as well as externally, this book expands the national discussion about war and the men and women who fight our nation’s battles. With close-up looks at servicemen and —women preparing for, experiencing, and returning home from war, Sherman probes the psyche of today’s soldiers—examining how they learn to kill and to leave the killing behind. Bringing to light the moral quandaries soldiers face—torture, the thin line between fighters and civilians, and the anguish of killing even in a just war—Sherman bares the souls of our soldiers and the emotional landscape of soldiering. At the heart of the book are interviews with soldiers, from the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also from Vietnam and World Wars I and II.""

DJ Jaffe blames the mental health industry and government for shunning the 10 million adults who are the most seriously mentally ill--mainly those who suffer from schizophrenia and severe bipolar disorder--and, instead, working to improve ""mental wellness"" in 43 million others, many of whom are barely symptomatic. Using industry and government documents, scientific journals, and anecdotes from his thirty years of advocacy, he documents the insane consequences of these industry-driven policies: psychiatric hospitals that once served the seriously ill have been closed; involuntary commitment criteria have been narrowed to the point where laws now require violence rather than prevent it; the public is endangered; and the mentally ill and their families are forced to suffer. Insane Consequences proposes smart, compassionate, affordable, and sweeping reforms designed to send the most seriously ill to the head of the line for services rather than to jails, shelters, prisons, and morgues. It lays out a roadmap to replace mission-creep with mission control and return the mental health system to a focus on the most seriously mentally ill. It is not money that is lacking; it's leadership. This book is a must read for anyone who works in the mental health industry or cares about the mentally ill, violence, homelessness, incarceration, or public policy""--  ""In this in-depth critique of the mental healthcare system, a leading advocate for the mentally ill argues that the system fails to adequately treat the most seriously ill. He proposes major reforms to bring help to schizophrenics, the severely bipolar, and others""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The result is a large number of new and original ideas that provide much food for thought. For instance, the clash between liberals and conservatives in U.S. politics is presented as a conflict between archetypal male and female energies. The rise of women, the author argues, is a sign that female energies -- bearing love, compassion and concern for community -- are finally counterbalancing the male energies of aggression and self-interest, leading to a healthier and more whole society.

Women and health/mental health,,mental_health,First published in 1965,/works/OL32440843W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1965|Publisher  [publisher not identified]|Language English|Pages 242,"For the purposes of documenting women's history, or ""herstory,"" the Women's History Library was launched in 1968 with content submitted by women from across the United States. Primary sources such as press clips, journals, alternative newspapers, fliers, research papers, graphics, and poetry represent an array of perspectives. The library blossomed as interest in women's history gained traction, and it became a valuable chronicler of the key years from 1965 to 1974 in the U.S. women's liberation movement. Women and Health/Mental Health is one important collection from that library. The Women and Health/Mental Health collection features pamphlets, speeches, newsletters, reports, memos, conference papers, mainstream and alternative newspaper stories, and academic journal articles. A subset of the collection comprises special issues of mass periodicals that focus on topics relevant to women's health, including People (women's medicine, sterilization, Planned Parenthood, sex education), Harper's Bazaar (sexuality), and Psychology Today (sexuality, sex education). Together, these sources provide a comprehensive account of the liberation movement era's perspectives on women's health and illnesses. Topics include nutrition and dieting, sleep and insomnia, addiction, hygiene, and depression. Women's biology and life-cycle concerns are treated extensively, including puberty, menstruation, childbirth, breastfeeding, menopause, and aging and death. Other subject matter pertains to gender identity and sex and sexuality, addressing such topics as bisexuality, homosexuality, transsexuality, intersexuality, and orgasm, affairs, and pornography. Some of the collection's resources are specific to black women and women from other parts of the world, including statistical and health information concerning sterilization, family planning, and health care. The largest focus of the Women and Health/Mental Health collection relates to abortion and birth control. Legal, financial, medical, and political aspects of the topics are taken into account in materials that address the establishment of abortion clinics and centers for women's health, and related protests. Information on birth control covers IUDs, male contraceptives, condoms, chastity, celibacy, and in particular the pill, which, because of its impact on the functions and risks of sex, was surrounded by fierce debates and protests. This collection offers unique insight into the evolution of thought and public discourse regarding women's bodies and health during a pivotal moment of social change in America.

Depression is often misunderstood because it is associated with moods, and we expect people to be able to control their mood swings. But depression is far more serious than being temporarily ""out of sorts."" Martha Maughon learned this through painful, first-hand experience. ""Why don't you just snap out of it?"" is an unfortunate but common response to a person suffering from depression. People who ask this, either audibly or silently, might as well say to a comatose patient, ""Why don't you just wake up?"" The morning after the traumatic birth of her daughter Becky, Martha woke up crying. Feelings of fear, doom, and anxiety enveloped her. She had a healthy new baby, a loving husband, and a happy family. Yet she was not happy. Her emotions were out of sync with her circumstances. She could not answer her own question: ""Why am I crying?"" But the answer to this persistent question was depression. A depression severe enough to push her dangerously close to suicide. But thanks to a supportive husband, a caring family, competent medical personnel, and a loving God, Martha's depression came under control. Martha's story -- bravely and candidly told -- shows that there are no quick-fix solutions to depression. But it also shows that there is hope. Hope for relief, hope for healing. And hope is what depressed people need most. - Back cover.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Literature was reviewed regarding the unique aspects of nursing and needs assessments. Five common methods of needs assessment were discussed. Two specific methods--the nominal group technique and the Delphi technique--were discussed, compared, and contrasted. The nominal group technique, with ratings on a Likert-type scale, was utilized with 27 nurses from five health care facilities. The study resulted in a list of 23 skills and another of 26 areas of knowledge.  The results of this needs assessment indicated that communication skills were seen as very important to all respondents. Other skills most nurses saw as important were interactive skills, ability to maintain confidentiality, problem solving/decision making, safe environment, and ability to prioritize/differentiate. The lowest rated skills were risk taking, technical skills, program planning, and staff scheduling.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Volunteers were randomly assigned to three treatment and one control group. Each treatment group was assigned one of the following tasks: (a) write about professional concerns, (b) discuss professional concerns, or (c) relax with provided refreshments. The writing and discussion groups were directed to address topics for 15 minutes related to the nursing profession, such as the emotional challenges of nursing, the professional implications of HIV-AIDS, and current economic trends. After the treatment period, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was administered. The control group was administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Each treatment and control group met one week later and repeated the same procedures a second time.  Research examined scores between three treatment and one control group. Group mean scores were compared by treatment and time to answer two research questions: (1) Were there significant differences in mean state anxiety scores between three treatment and one control group of female registered nurses? (2) Were there significant differences in mean state anxiety scores after a second treatment one week following the initial intervention? To answer question one, an analysis of variance was used to compare the four group means for both first and second treatment periods. None were significant at the.05 level of confidence. To answer question two, means were compared between time 1 and time 2 for each of the four groups. A paired group t-test procedure was used. Only the mean difference for the control group was significant at the.05 level.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
SELF-DIRECTED SKILLS NURSING MODEL: DECREASE BURNOUT IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CAREGIVERS,Catherine Caston,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279481W,/authors/OL5368739A/Catherine_Caston,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 223,"The purposes of the study were to test a nursing intervention model, Self-Directed Skills (SDS), to determine the effectiveness of the model on primary family caregivers (PFCs) who provide 60 to 75 percent of the care of an African-American homebound frail elderly relative without relief for greater than six months. The study specifically aimed to: (1) implement and evaluate the SDS nursing intervention model using the Satir paradigm, and (2) evaluate the pre-post test differences between the experimental and control groups on levels of self-esteem, enmeshment, service utilization, burden and burnout.  The research question tested was: What is the effect of the SDS intervention on self-esteem, health service utilization, enmeshment, burden and burnout on African-American family caregivers of homebound frail elderly? The design of the study was experimental. The hypothesized results were that PFCs in the experimental group will have increased self-esteem, high use of service agencies, decreased enmeshment, and decreased burden and burnout after the SDS intervention model.  The sample consisted of 60 PFCs selected by random sampling (30 experimental and 30 control). The caregiver met the following criteria: a relative of the care recipient, lived in a 100-mile radius of the Greater New Orleans area, spoke English, and able to read and write. Each research participant had 24 contact hours with the researcher (experimental group--SDS Model) and research assistants (control group--friendly visits).  The chi-square, frequency rate, percent and paired t-test were used to analyze quantitative data. The results of this study indicated the PFC's self-esteem, burden, and burnout scores were statistically significant. A global rating scale was used to evaluate the responses of the PFCs' enmeshment score. The global rating indicated high enmeshment pre-intervention and low enmeshment post-intervention. Hypotheses one, two and four were supported by this data.  Hypothesis three was not supported. The PFCs assumed total responsibility for their care recipients. Therefore, decreased enmeshment and decreased caregiver burden and burnout did not increase health service utilization. This evidence showed that there was little to no use of formal health care agencies pre- or post-intervention.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
EXTRACTION AND STRUCTURE OF DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE FOR SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT FOR ALCOHOL ADDICTION NURSING,Camille Grosso,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280744W,/authors/OL5369871A/Camille_Grosso,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 264,"The purpose of this study was to define the domain of alcohol addiction nursing in acute care practice settings. The study was undertaken as the preliminary step of expert system development based on nursing knowledge for this domain. The method elicited an initial set of domain related ideas. The resultant knowledge base is part of the substantive knowledge of nursing. The study was also undertaken as a method to systematically gather the knowledge in practice for theory development. The study isolated factors which are the building blocks for nursing practice theory.  The study used a knowledge acquisition strategy to elicit the knowledge of practicing expert nurses. Interactive interviewing was undertaken with fifteen certified nurses as they interacted with a computer assisted instruction (CAI) on the care of the alcohol addicted client presenting at a hospital emergency room. Interactive interviewing was characterized as taking its lead from verbalizations of the experts, probing with questions to explore deeper.  The knowledge was initially structured within seven categories posited by nursing scholars as central concepts in nursing and labeled in this study as the broad disciplinary conceptualizations (BDC's). The BDC's were used as a manifest representation of the nursing discipline. The analysis generated demarcation of the domain into patterns of knowledge each comprising the substance of nursing related to the nursing client, the nursing process, health, the environment, transitions, nursing interactions, and nursing therapeutics, i.e. the BDC's. An overview of the domain also resulted from a synthesis of descriptions provided by the expert alcohol addiction nurses describing what alcohol addictions is, and how it is different than other specialty areas of nursing. An exemplar of a patient was presented demonstrating the complexity of care in this domain.  The representation is incomplete in that it focuses only on acute care of alcohol addiction; no other addiction or phases of addiction. It only partially identifies the problem states or sequencing of problems in the domain. The problem states and the sequencing will be determined with further inquiry.

A HERMENEUTICAL ANALYSIS OF PSYCHIATRIC NURSES' STORIES OF THEIR PATIENT EDUCATION EXPERIENCES,Patricia Ellen Freed,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280230W,/authors/OL5369390A/Patricia_Ellen_Freed,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 171,"Psychiatric nursing, as a world in the phenomenologic sense, is consistent of phenomenon which contain tacit or hidden knowledge. The phenomenon of patient education in psychiatric nursing has not been adequately investigated. In order for the knowledge hidden in practice to be of value to the community of interest, it must be revealed by a process which penetrates to the meaning of the experience for those who have it.  A hermeneutical analysis of psychiatric nurses' stories of their patient education experiences led to the discovery of three themes: The Teaching-Way, Being-in-Between and Seeing-Inside. When taken together, the three themes capture the essence of the one-to-one patient education experience and reveal the constitutive pattern of Perseverance, which marks the meaning of the phenomenon.  The salience of these findings to nursing education is reassuring since the Teaching Way and Seeing-Inside represent desired nursing qualities. Psychiatric nurses engage in teaching their patients with mental illness and are committed to teaching as they act from a mind-set which looks for the advantage of ""teaching moments"" in every patient contact. But as higher education faces an increasingly strapped economic future, nurse educators must be ever-cautious to guard against the erosion of educational practices which have in the past contributed to the internalization of the patient educator role.  Frustration and the potential for ethical conflict associated with Being-in-Between demand that nurse educators provide students with more of the skills and knowledge they need to function within the political and economic realities of healthcare.  The meaning of patient education revealed in this interpretive study of psychiatric nurses' stories suggests that further research should explore the phenomenon (a) with specific populations, (b) in different settings, (c) for power inequities associated with Being-in-Between, (d) for further understandings of the socio-political forces that impact on patient education in psychiatric nursing, and (e) to see if the Teaching Way and Seeing-Inside are components of the teaching-coaching function in other specialty nursing areas.

ATTITUDES TOWARD PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITY: THE OPINIONS ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS SCALE IN NURSING EDUCATION EVALUATION,Stephen Imbornoni,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281158W,/authors/OL5370250A/Stephen_Imbornoni,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 216,"The Cohen and Struening (1962) Opinions about Mental Illness (OMI) scale was used to measure nursing student attitudes toward psychiatric disability across a two year nursing education program. Participant OMI responses were examined for association with a social desirability response bias and for similarities with attitudes toward other disabilities. Also evaluated were the test-retest reliability, correlations among the subscales, and the internal consistency of the OMI.  Repeated measures OMI subscale ANOVAs with post hoc dependent t tests (Bonferroni adjusted) found reduced authoritarian attitudes over the first year of nursing education (n = 49, t = 4.36, $p<.0001).$ The failure to find attitude change associated with a multisite semester psychiatric nursing field rotation was interpreted within the attitude change contact hypothesis literature. An extensive OMI literature review and suggestions for future research were provided.  No significant relationship was found between the OMI and the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS) (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960), nor between the MCSDS and the Scale of Attitudes toward Disabled Persons (SADP) (Antonak, 1982). Low to moderate correlations, were found between the OMI and SADP (n = 130, rs =.25 to.53, $p<.01).$ An endorsement of OMI mental illness interpersonal etiology was negatively associated with SADP positive attitudes toward persons with disability (r = $-$.31, $p<.001).$.  Moderate to high test-retest reliability was found for the OMI at 3 and 10 weeks (n = 46, rs =.59 to.85). Test-retest for the MCSDS (n = 44, mean r =.89) extended previous findings. Moderate test-retest correlations were found for the SADP (n = 44, mean r =.43).  Eight low to moderate correlations were found among the OMI subscores (N = 182, rs =.24 to.58, $p<.001).$ OMI Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients ranged from.24 to.68, with an exploratory alpha for the entire OMI of.76, suggesting a possible unidimensional OMI structure. Alpha values for the SADP (n = 114, $alpha$ =.71 to.89) and the MCSDS (n = 181, $alpha$ =.77) were also presented.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"A DESCRIPTIVE AND CORRELATIONAL STUDY OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, RISK FACTORS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES AMONG SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL VETERANS IN A DAY TREATMENT PROGRAM",Ann P. Hutton,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12278899W,/authors/OL5368245A/Ann_P._Hutton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 479,"Persistence of unexplained, excessive rates of medical illnesses among clients with severe mental illness argued for a closer look at types of illnesses and risk factors, considering factors such as age and psychosocial conditions that may covary with physical health status. A sample of 73 Veterans Administration clients who attended a day treatment program responded to questionnaires, and 72 were given physical examinations.  One hundred eighty-nine major health problems were identified among 62 subjects (86%). Forty-seven percent (n = 89) had not been recognized previously. Unrecognized problems occurred in 69% (n = 50) of subjects. Minor unrecognized health problems occurred in 89% (n = 64) of subjects (79%, or 181 conditions). Major problems requiring attention were found in 76% of subjects. These rates are consistent with rates previously reported, but are in excess of rates for the population in general. Of major health problems, 59% were considered treatable by better control of chronic conditions and health counseling (secondary and tertiary prevention).  Rates for smoking, chronic drinking, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia significantly exceeded estimated rates for Utah. The rate of smoking for Veterans Administration subjects at 55% exceeded Utah and national rates, but was less than the 70% to 88% rate reported for psychiatric clients in general.  Major health problems were correlated significantly (p $le$.01) with age, diagnoses of nonpsychotic disorders (n = 21, 29%) and depression, taking antidepressant drugs, low functional health, low perceived health, high risk factor scores, and reporting weakness and fatigue. The best set of independent variables predicted 56% of variance in number of major health problems. These variables were low functional health, taking antidepressants, perceiving problems with exercise, not taking antipsychotics, and age.  Nonpsychotic compared with psychotic subjects were more likely to be married, have higher health support scores, but also to report significantly more frustration, stress, weakness, and fatigue. Ambiguous symptoms can be confused with depression or anxiety, or with side effects from neuroleptic drugs, and may mask medical conditions.  Subjects' need for health prevention and promotion programs seems indisputable; however, prevention may be superseded by mental health and supportive service needs. Reasons for high rates of health conditions and risk factors, theoretical implications, recommendations for improving health care, and suggestions for further study are discussed.

THE EFFECT OF TEACHING CUE RECOGNITION ON THE ABILITY OF HOME CARE NURSES TO ASSESS MENTAL STATUS,Cherrill W. Colson,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278481W,/authors/OL5367882A/Cherrill_W._Colson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 186,"The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to examine the effect of teaching cue recognition on the ability of home care nurses to assess mental status. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design was used to test 80 volunteer nurses in eight home care settings in a metropolitan area. Demographic data were collected on experience, education and mental status practices.  Home care nurses were pretested on ability to assess mental status using videotaped simulations of nurse-client interviews after which, nurses were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group for separate instructional programs. The instruction for the experimental group used a model for teaching mental status assessment adapted from Gagne's information processing model of learning and memory. The experimental group received an assessment guide and watched a videotape identifying components of mental status with salient behavioral cues. The guide and videotape for the control group were equivalent but without the salient behavioral cues. Following the instructional programs, the nurses were brought back together for posttesting using different videotaped nurse-client simulated interviews.  Results of the study showed the experimental and control groups were equivalent in pretested assessment ability and demographic characteristics. Posttest scores for the experimental group showed a significant increase in assessment ability and were significantly higher than control group's scores, both at p $<$.000. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of using the model for teaching mental status assessment.  Having a baccalaureate degree in nursing showed a positive correlation with pretest assessment ability. Posttest assessment ability showed a significant correlation with number of years in nursing practice and having a graduate degree. Other findings of interest were 84% of nurses reported learning mental status in their basic nursing program yet, 67% felt only somewhat prepared to assess it. Eighty-three per cent believed home care nurses should always assess mental status but, only 44% report doing so regularly. Implications for curricular changes, home health care practices and health care reform are discussed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
THE BACCALAUREATE NURSING STUDENT'S EXPERIENCE IN A PSYCHIATRIC CLINICAL SETTING: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY (NURSING STUDENT),Kathleen Virginia Newman,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268219W,/authors/OL5359990A/Kathleen_Virginia_Newman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 234,"During the last fifty years there have been many changes which affected the nursing care of the mentally ill. These changes have influenced psychiatric nursing education. Many nursing programs integrate psychiatric nursing theory and have limited clinical experiences. The purpose of the clinical component of psychiatric nursing is to experience the real world of nursing practice. The psychiatric nursing education literature does not reflect the dynamics of the experience or offer findings which might influence the education for nursing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the experience of the baccalaureate nursing student in a psychiatric setting and the meaning of the experience from the student's point of view.  This descriptive study used a phenomenological approach. Seventeen senior level nursing students were interviewed. They were asked to describe their perception of the clinical experience. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's (1978) method.  Results revealed that the student moved through this experience in phases and developed a personal knowing. The student was able to reflect on the experience and its impact on self awareness, and on the awareness of others. The student looked back at the experience as being meaningful by providing an opportunity for development as a person and nurse. This experience helped the student to become a better nurse and to be able to use the knowledge gained anywhere. The student suggested more involvement in the setting for future clinical experiences of nursing students.  The description of the clinical experience was based on the themes which emerged during data analysis. Trustworthiness was established by the audit trail and returning to the students for validation of the description. The students who were contacted agreed that the description represented the experience.  The researcher concluded that the relevance of the psychiatric clinical experience could be greatly enhanced with continued incorporation of mental health concepts into the curriculum, along with greater and more holistic involvement with psychiatric clinical nursing care.

"OBESITY AND THE EXPERIENCE OF EATING IN ADULT, AMERICAN, CAUCASIAN WOMEN: A GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH",Sheryl Sue Russell,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279903W,/authors/OL5369130A/Sheryl_Sue_Russell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 201,"The search to unravel the complex phenomenon of obesity has been pursued for centuries. Theoretical postulations regarding the etiology of obesity and subsequent management strategies are numerous and complex. Despite decades of clinical application, the rising prevalence of obesity remains essentially unchanged. Clearly it is time to consider a new perspective.  In view of the continued failure of programs to effectively achieve successful long-term weight management, a re-evaluation of the phenomenon of eating is warranted. A grounded theory design provided the opportunity to explore this phenomenon in a new light. This study attempts to understand the phenomenon of eating in adult, American, Caucasian women from the perspective of the reality of the women who experience it. The resulting theory of seeking solace through eating emerged from the context of the social process in which it was embedded. Embracing this new understanding of eating and obesity, realistic strategies may be designed to promote health and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Nursing interfaces with people at all phases of the life cycle and, therefore, is in a unique position to influence this continued health problem.

"HUMAN PATTERNING AND CHRONIC PAIN (UNITARY HUMAN BEINGS, PAIN, ROGERS MARTHA)",Katherine Emily Rapacz,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268669W,/authors/OL5360357A/Katherine_Emily_Rapacz,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 148,"Chronic pain is a disabling health problem which affects 75-80 million Americans. Pain is one of the most common concerns demanding nursing attention and action among patients. Current success in the management and/or alleviation of chronic pain ranges from 50-85%.  Rogers' science of unitary human beings served as the theoretical basis for the study to offer a new perspective on chronic pain. The study was descriptive and exploratory. Its purpose was to test the notion of unitary field patterning as the basic unit of observation for studying holistic human beings. The research questions asked if there were differences in pattern manifestations between a group with chronic pain and a group without chronic pain.  The chronic pain group consisted of individuals seeking treatment for chronic pain from a pain management program or individual health care practitioners in the San Francisco, Phoenix, and Cleveland areas (N = 113). A comparison group matched on age, sex, race and residence was recruited from community groups and public gathering places (N = 113). The sample was predominantly female (61%), white (96.5%) and age 19-49 (80%). Pain characteristics of interest included severity, frequency, duration, and event of onset. Pain related variables included occupation, medication use, compensation and litigation. The main variables of interest were pattern manifestation measures developed within Rogers' abstract system. Pattern measures included Ference's Human Field Motion (HFM) test (alpha =.94) and Barrett's Power as Knowing Participation in Change (PKPC) test (alpha =.94).  Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed significant differences between groups on pattern manifestation measures (p $<$.001). Age, sex, race, and place of residence were controlled through the matching procedure. MANOVA revealed group membership to be the only variable significantly related to patterning differences.  The findings of this study support the notion of pattern as the unit of observation in nursing research. The group with chronic pain was found to have lower frequency patterning, as measured by HFM and PKPC, than the matched comparison group. Recommendations include replication and extension, incorporating treatments such as light, sound, and imagery and the use of HFM and PKPC as outcome measures.

EFFECTS OF STRESS ON SPOUSE CAREGIVERS' PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND CELLULAR IMMUNITY,Judith J. Mccann,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268558W,/authors/OL5360261A/Judith_J._Mccann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 218,"This research investigated the potential health-related consequences of long-term caregiving on women whose husbands have a dementing illness. The central question was, ""Do spouse caregivers' reports of psychologic stress and burden have a physiologic correlate?"" Lazarus and Folkman's model of stress, appraisal, and coping provided the framework for this study.  The sample included 34 caregivers and 33 noncaregivers. All subjects were age 60 or older, married females, living with their spouses. Caregivers and noncaregivers were matched for socioeconomic status and use of estrogen and beta-blocker medications. Strict criteria were used to eliminate subjects who reported immune-related illness or medications (other than estrogens and beta-blockers), excessive alcohol use, or other sources of chronic stress.  Independent variables included: environmental stressors, perceived stress levels, social support, and coping behaviors. The primary dependent variables were psychological health and cellular immunity. Cellular immunity was measured by blood samples and delayed hypersensitivity skin testing.  T-tests revealed that caregivers reported significantly higher levels of environmental stressors and perceived stress, and significantly lower levels of social support. Caregivers also exhibited significantly more symptomatic distress on measures of psychological health. Groups did not differ on coping behaviors.  Based on skin test results, caregivers demonstrated significantly poorer cellular immune function than noncaregivers. Compared to normative standards for age and gender, 50% of caregivers were totally or relatively anergic versus 12% of noncaregivers. Differences between groups were not attributable to differences in sleep patterns, physical activity, smoking behavior, alcohol use, or serum albumin levels.  Regression analysis revealed that measures of stress, social support, and coping behavior explained a substantial amount of variance in psychological health. However, none of these independent variables accounted for much variance in measures of cellular immunity.  Clearly, caregivers experience suppression of cellular immune function which appears to be related to their status as caregivers. They are more stressed, more depressed, and feel less supported than noncaregivers; yet, these factors alone do not account for the differences in cellular immunity demonstrated in this study. Recommendations include periodic screening of caregivers for depression and impaired cellular immunity, and the development of appropriate interventions.

"THE EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING, COMBINING MEDITATION AND GUIDED IMAGERY, ON SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS AMONG CHINESE NURSES IN LARGE TEACHING HOSPITALS IN TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA",Sing-Ling Tsai,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273461W,/authors/OL5363929A/Sing-Ling_Tsai,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 243,"The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of relaxation training which was based on cognitive-behavioral model and was specifically focused on helping Chinese registered nurses employed in large teaching hospitals to reduce their work stress in Taiwan, Republic of China. The study design was a pretest post-test control design with two post-test points. The one hundred and thirty-seven subjects were selected randomly from three first-ranked teaching hospitals. Twenty-three subjects in one group and twenty-three in the other group for each hospital with one subject absent in the experimental group in the pretest condition of this study.  The treatment of the experimental group consisted of two sessions of relaxation technique based on Smith's cognitive behavioral model of relaxation at Week One, Week Two, and a follow-up session in the fifth week. The control group had the same sequence of sessions with a presentation by the researcher on theory analysis in nursing.  The mean scores on the Nurse Stress Checklist (NSC) and the Chinese General Health Questionnaire differed significantly between the experimental and control group in Post-test Two at Week Five. These results supported the hypotheses that the relaxation training decreased the Chinese nurse self reported work stress as measured by Nurse Stress Checklist and increased the Chinese nurse self reported psychophysiologic health as measured by Chinese General Health Questionnaire. The significant difference on means of the Chinese General Health Questionnaire in Post-test One at Week Two showed that the self reported psychophysiologic health level responded to the relaxation training earlier than to the self reported work stress level. In the treatment of relaxation, duration of practice was an important factor for the effectiveness of this treatment on the dependent variable of NSC.  It is suggested that even brief teaching of relaxation techniques may reduce work stress levels and promote a sense of psychophysiologic health in Chinese nurses who are employed in large teaching hospitals in Taiwan, Republic of China.

LIFE IS HARD: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF HOMELESS WOMEN DIAGNOSED AS CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL,Cheryl Taylor-Walton,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266289W,/authors/OL5358353A/Cheryl_Taylor-Walton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 216,"The purpose of this phenomenological study was to generate data which describe women's experiences and meanings of being homeless and chronically mentally ill. The sample of availability consisted of 10 homeless women who have been treated by a psychiatric health care team for homeless persons. Experiential analysis and the ethnographic technique of participation were used by the researcher to gain entry and to establish credibility and trustworthiness in the field (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Reinharz, 1979).  Participants were interviewed using the technique of talk/turning within--an open creative interview format (Ray, 1987). The taped interviews were transcribed and analyzed. Data analysis used Colaizzi's (1978) phenomenological technique. The unity of meaning of the study findings is in the statement: ""Life is Hard."".  Findings revealed five dimensions commonly experienced within contexts of homelessness. They are a sense of person, a sense of place, a sense of timing, a sense of community, and a sense of humor. An antecedent metatheme, Disequilibrium, emerged with themes of poverty, personal and family stressors, losing control, and repeated cycles of illness. Findings revealed four additional metathemes: personhood, uncertainties, creative survival tactics, and relationships.  Developing appropriate nursing diagnoses and using the nursing process has the potential for improving the quality of care of homeless persons. Baseline data about everyday challenges that homeless women face may facilitate greater understanding of homeless women's needs and risk factors that led to their homelessness. The nurse's awareness of how chronically mentally ill homeless women participate in their care would enhance use of the care-planning process. The nurse's increased awareness may contribute to further development of community health program-planning strategies and public policies that provide comprehensive supportive services and funding to chronically mentally ill homeless women.  The nurse's understanding of the meaning of experiences of homeless women diagnosed as chronically mentally ill may promote a means for improving client/nurse interactions, advocacy, care-planning strategies, access and utilization of available health care services. Nursing may play a more significant role in providing emergency and supportive services, identifying risk factors of homelessness, and intervening with persons on the verge of being homeless.

In addition to identification of BP and HR modifiers, regression analyses were performed to identify psychosocial predictors of BP and HR response during Work, Off work, and Sleep times as well as to discover the moderating effect of social support on these relationships. The results are as follows: (1) Although traditional risk factors did have associations with the outcome variables, the models produced by regression analyses did not consistently include such items. (2) The most consistent predictors of higher mean BP response across times of day were increased age and resentment. (3) Contrastingly, increased levels of anger were related to decreased mean SBP for Work, Off work, and Sleep times. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. (4) Social support was found to be an infrequent influence on the relationship between risk factors and psychosocial characteristics and blood pressure. Only DBP mean levels were influenced by social support. (5) Despite the biracial makeup of the subjects (55% Black, 45% White or Hispanic) ethnicity was not a determinant of any major BP or HR characteristic. (6) BP variability and HR were much less consistently related to the independent variables than BP means.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"PREDICTORS OF AIDS RISKY BEHAVIOR AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN (SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, IMMUNE DEFICIENCY)",Rhonda Katrina Hollis,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280278W,/authors/OL5369434A/Rhonda_Katrina_Hollis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 99,"The incidence and mortality of AIDS for African American women continue to escalate. How to effect a change in sexual behavior is a formidable task facing health professionals. The purpose of this cross-sectional, correlational study was twofold. The first was to determine if a significant relationship exists among selected variables singularly, and condom use, the criterion variable. The second was to identify which variable or combination of variables best predicts condom use among African American women. The selected variables examined were: age, education, risky sex knowledge, casual sex knowledge, AIDS feelings, self-efficacy, social norm, religious well-being, existential well-being, and condom use. Theoretical triangulation using Bandura's (1986) Social Cognitive Theory, Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action, and Moberg's (1971) and Paloutzian and Ellison's (1979) Spiritual Well-being conceptual frameworks guided this study.  A nonprobability sample of 161 sexually active African American women, aged 20 to 70 years, 70 percent college educated, in the midwestern region of the United States was surveyed. Participants completed four questionnaires: Dancy's (1991) AIDS Knowledge, Feelings, Behavior Questionnaire; investigator developed Social Norms Questionnaire; Paloutzian and Ellison's (1982) Spiritual Well-Being Scale, and a Demographic Questionnaire.  Based on hierarchical regression analysis, age and social norm were the best predictors of condom use among AAW. Younger AAW were more likely to use condoms, than older ones. Social norm related to condom use was more likely to influence younger AAW's condom use.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
PREDICTING PSYCHIATRIC DISTRESS IN URBAN AMERICAN INDIAN ADOLESCENTS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,Patricia Silk Walker,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278667W,/authors/OL5368044A/Patricia_Silk_Walker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 160,"Risk factors found significant for psychiatric outcome in non-Indian adolescents were tested on Child Behavior Checklist Internalizing, Externalizing and Total Behavior scores. Subjects were 211 of 224 (94%) urban American Indian youth, mean age 11 years at initial interview (T1) and 14 years at 36-month follow-up (T4). Males and females were equally represented. Data were from a longitudinal study that used structured annual interviews with a youth and primary caretaker. Biographic Questionnaires, an Alcohol and Drug Use Questionnaire, Harter's People in my Life and What I am Like, Derogatis' Brief Symptom Inventory and Moos Family Relationships Index provided predictor variables. Internal consistency reliability of scales, including three produced by the research project, was evaluated and found adequate for research and clinical applications.  Multiple regression analyses revealed caretaker psychiatric distress, family conflict (anger and aggression) and repeating a grade predicted Total Behavior Problems at T1 and T4 and Internalizing and Externalizing scores at T4. T1 Total Behavior predictors and their standardized Betas were: Caretaker psychiatric distress (.31); Family conflict (.22); Classmate regard ($-$.18); Number of deviant behaviors of peers (.15); and, Repeated a grade (.12). T4 Total Behavior predictors and Betas were: Caretaker psychiatric distress (.17); Family conflict (.19); Number of deviant behaviors of peers (.16); Repeated a grade (.18); Number of major life changes (.14); Proportion of youth's life in the city (.14); Number of Indian ritual activities the youth reported ($-$.14). The proportion of the youth's life in the city predicted Internalizing behavior (Beta =.15). Number of deviant behaviors of peers (Beta =.18) and Indian rituals (Beta = $-$.16) predicted Externalizing behavior. The best predictor of T4 behaviors was T1 Total Behavior Problems with Betas of.41 (Internalizing),.31 (Externalizing) and.46 (Total Behavior Problems).  Results suggest that youth who fail a grade, whose caretaker displays high levels of psychiatric distress and whose family is in conflict need to be recognized and that services be provided the entire family for maximum benefit. Results are discussed from a public health perspective, noting the need to reframe and restructure extant academic, social, family, health and mental health programs to better coordinate prevention and intervention.

Napoleón es un esquizofrénico y paciente de un hospital siquiátrico, que nos Ileva a un viaje a través de su afinada memoria. Nos Ileva a una época en la que la pobreza, la escasez y la enfermedad habitaban en cada esquina oscura de un Santiago olvidado y despreciado, dejado a la suerte de la ley del más fuerte. Rigoberto es su siquiatra y el encargado de guiar a Napoleón a través de los episodios más crueles de su Vida; pero pronto descubriria con sorpresa que su paciente seria nave y capitán de su propio relato, sin tener necesidad de asistirlo en ningán momento. Con cada sesión, Rigoberto va desvelando poco a poco el pasado sombrio del enfermo y las razones que lo Ilevaron al quiebre mental y espiritual, por las que fue sentenciado al ostracismo, atado a una cama y a una existencia decadente.""--Page 4 of cover.

A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING ANALYSIS OF NURSING CARE EPISODES AS PERCEIVED BY ADULT SURGICAL PATIENTS AND PROFESSIONAL NURSES,Julia Ann Fisco Houfek,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265629W,/authors/OL5357785A/Julia_Ann_Fisco_Houfek,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 316,"This study investigated the dimensions underlying 17 nursing care episodes, or routine nursing care situations, as perceived by adult surgical patients and professional nurses responsible for the care of these patients. Differences among subjects with regard to the relative importance that they assigned to the dimensions were also studied.  Judgments about the dissimilarity of the nursing care episodes were made by 35 patients and 19 nurses. An additional 14 patients and 14 nurses rated the episodes on 10 attribute rating scales. Patients' and nurses' dissimilarity data were analyzed separately with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedures. Subjects' attribute ratings were regressed over the MDS solutions using multiple regression techniques in order to interpret the dimensions of the MDS configurations.  Two three-dimensional MDS models were chosen to represent patients' and nurses' perceptions. Structural symbolic interactionism was used to interpret the models. Patients appeared to judge the episodes based on the following attributes: the participation or involvement required of that patient, the nursing knowledge/skill needed by the nurse, and whether the episodes involved pain or gave the patient information. These dimensions were named: Personal Participation/Significance, Nursing Knowledge/Skill, and Instrumental versus Informational Nursing Care Episodes. Nurses appeared to use the following attributes in their judgments: whether the episode helped the patient gain independence, the nursing knowledge/skill needed, and the degree to which the nurse could individualize the episode for the patient. These dimensions were named: Patient Independence, Nursing Knowledge/Skill, and Individualized versus Generalized Nursing Care Episodes. Compared to nurses, patients had a more complex view of their involvement in the episodes, emphasizing the activities performed and the personal significance of the episodes. Nurses stressed the physical activities that promoted patient independence.  An analysis of patterns of dimensional salience suggested that patients who emphasized Personal Participation/Significance tended to receive more doses of analgesics and tended to be under 30 years old, but these differences were not statistically significant. Nurses' patterns of dimensional salience indicated that nurses with the least nursing experience emphasized the Patient Independence dimension.

VIOLENCE: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS,Karen Janice Evanczuk,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265079W,/authors/OL5357319A/Karen_Janice_Evanczuk,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 216,"On psychiatric units nurses are faced daily with the possibility of patient violence. Although the prediction and management of violent behavior has been the subject of study by researchers using quantitative methods, no similar qualitative studies have emerged.  The purpose of this phenomenological analysis is to describe the psychiatric inpatient's experience of being violent. The understanding gained from this study is intended to be utilized to mediate violent behavior by teaching patients to choose nondestructive actions in similar circumstances.  The setting was an acute care, university-based psychiatric facility located in a metropolitan area in western Pennsylvania. Six subjects, three women and three men, ages fourteen to thirty-nine, described their violent behavior. An open-ended interviewing approach was utilized. The participants had been physically assaultive against another patient or a staff member. Data were collected through a series of three interviews.  The analysis method of phenomenologist Paul Colaizzi was used. Individual meaning units, themes and descriptions were derived from the raw data. These elements were then used to synthesize a common description of the experience of being violent which incorporated the commonalities across all six individual descriptions.  Two main differences were found in the subjects' views of their violent behavior. For some it was seen as a part of their illness or of their personhood because of their illness. For others it was viewed as a normal reaction to a provocation.  Across all subjects was the feeling of being unjustly singled out and treated unfairly. Two subjects had been victims of traumatic assaults in the past. Their assault on another was triggered by a thought or a feeling which was related to that previous incident. The others had prior verbal altercations with the person they assaulted.  Subjects differed in their desire to resolve the incident with the assaulted person. The importance of clear enunciations of unit rules regarding the acting out of physical violence on the unit was demonstrated.  This research demonstrated that by gaining an understanding of a particular individual's violence it was possible to understand under what circumstances future violence might occur in that person.

"LIFE SCRIPT OPTION, EXISTENTIAL LIFE POSITION, AND DIFFERENTIATION OF SELF: A TEST OF TRANSACTIONAL ANALYSIS THEORY",Estelle Irene Kurtz,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265226W,/authors/OL5357452A/Estelle_Irene_Kurtz,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 188,"This descriptive, ex post facto study tested selected theoretical assumptions of Transactional Analysis using a convenience sample of 299 undergraduate and graduate women enrolled in a health-related major in a large urban university.  Differentiation of self was measured with the Family Systems Personality Profile. Existential life position regarding OKness of self and others was measured with the Feelings Inventory. Life script option categories were established based on the TA clinical assessment construct of open escape hatches (suicide, homicide/antisocial, going crazy) and measured with the Life Beliefs Questionnaire.  The chi square test showed the relationship between life position and script option to be significant (p =.002). The sample was categorized most often as I'm OK-You're OK. Categorization in the positive script option group predicted categorization in the positive life position group and categorization in the negative life position group predicted categorization in the negative script option groups. The predicted relationship between specific life positions and script options was not supported. The theoretical assumption of a Not OK cultural life position for women also was not supported.  With demographic variables controlled, there was a significant relationship between differentiation of self and both life position (p =.0035) and script option (p =.0012). Factor analyses of the LBQ and the FI supported the four factor life script option theoretical construct, but not the predicted four factor structure for existential life position.  Of this normal sample, 49% met criteria categorizing them in the negative life script option groups. Since script option is thought to be decisional and changeable, the findings of this study have significance for the practice of nursing at all levels of prevention.

PSYCHOSOCIAL COPING AND ADJUSTMENT DURING PREGNANCY,Dawn Ranae Van Velzen,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265559W,/authors/OL5357733A/Dawn_Ranae_Van_Velzen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 165,"Childbearing can be a joyful experience for many women. However, at the same time, the dramatic physical, psychological, and social changes that accompany pregnancy can be overwhelming. In this investigation, crisis theory predictions for conditions of increased stress, resulting from the changes of pregnancy, were hypothesized. Under increased stress, pregnant women with and without numerous psychosocial coping resources were expected to experience distress. That is, when changes accompanying pregnancy were of significant magnitude, a time-limited state of ""crisis"" was predicted.  Participants were 120 primiparous and multiparous women recruited from a private obstetrical clinic. Initial measures of sociodemographic characteristics, depression and anxiety (Costello-Comrey Depression and Anxiety scales; Costello & Comrey, 1967), pregnancy stress, and psychosocial coping resources (Personal Resources Questionnaire; Osipow & Spokane, 1983) were completed by participants and mailed to the investigator. Two-month followup measures of depression, anxiety, and pregnancy stress were completed at the obstetrical clinic.  Hierarchical regression of depression and anxiety on sociodemographic factors, stress change, and psychosocial resources indicated that stressful events directly influenced depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Consistent with crisis theory, under high stress, pregnant women experienced high depression and anxiety regardless of psychosocial resources levels. Supplementary analyses indicated that the sample of women experiencing extremely stressful events (events which also were likely to recur or be ongoing during pregnancy) reported high anxiety (tension and difficulties with problem management). More generally, women experiencing high numbers of new types of stress (events which also were likely to be rated as mildly or moderately stressful) reported low levels of depression when numerous psychosocial resources were available; however, when few psychosocial resources were available, high levels of new types of stress were associated with high levels of depression (negative outlook and unhappiness).  Recommendations were made for counseling and educating pregnant women about the negative influence of increased stress and the positive influence of psychosocial resources on psychological adjustment. The importance of further research on psychosocial processes of pregnancy and postpartum adjustment was emphasized.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
STRUCTURE OF THE SELF AND STABILITY OF SELF-ESTEEM,Karen Lea Farchaus Stein,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265285W,/authors/OL5357497A/Karen_Lea_Farchaus_Stein,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 99,"Why some individuals are able to cope effectively with a stressful life event while others who experience the same event suffer anxiety, depression and other negative physical and psychological outcomes is one of the most important, yet challenging questions facing nurses today. Recently, stress and coping theorists have asserted that individuals who experience a loss or decrease in self-esteem when faced with a life event are more likely than others to experience negative coping outcomes. Although little is currently known about why some individuals are more vulnerable to self-esteem threats than others, a series of studies completed in the last decade suggests that individual differences in the way information about the self is organized in memory may play an important role in determining the stability of self-esteem (Linville, 1985; Markus, 1977). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the organizational properties of the self-schema and stability of self-esteem.  A quasi-experimental design was used for this study which was completed in two experimental sessions. During the first session, the organizational properties of the ""student"" self-schema were measured in a sample of 151 undergraduate students. In addition, subjects completed a collection of semantic differential scales designed to measure self-esteem. In session 2 subjects were asked by a different experimenter to complete a fictitious intelligence test and were given bogus feedback about their performance. After receiving the feedback, subjects completed a series of self-descriptive measures including the self-esteem measure completed during session 1.  Results of least squares analyses of variance revealed that low integration subjects experienced more change in self-evaluation after receiving the feedback than high integration subjects regardless of the feedback condition. Other processing differences between the two groups were also found.  The results of this study suggest that the organizational properties of the self structure do influence the individual's reactions to stressors. Further research is necessary to assess the role of these factors in reactions to naturally occurring stressful life events.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
AN INTERPRETIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS OF A NURSING HOME STAFF GROUP,Nora Sweeny Hickey,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264817W,/authors/OL5357067A/Nora_Sweeny_Hickey,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 305,"The quality of care received by the nursing home resident is influenced by the caregivers' self-perceptions, stress, and burnout levels. By improving nursing home staff members' self-perceptions and decreasing their stress and burnout levels, it is speculated that nursing home residents could receive better care.  Because group programs have demonstrated positive individual and organizational effects on multiple populations in various settings, the literature suggests that optimum care of the elderly can be achieved through the implementation of a supportive group program for nursing home staff. There is, however, limited evidence of prior use of groups with nursing home staff. The aim of this study, therefore, was to compare the process of a group of nursing home staff in the context of their unique elements, to a synthesized model of group process to determine if what happened in the group of nursing home staff fit with the process of other groups.  The group in this study was a team of nursing staff from a unit in a suburban nursing home. It was an open group consisting of a core group of six professional and paraprofessional, female, nursing staff with attendance ranging from two to eight members per session. The leader was a psychiatric clinical nurse specialist.  The content of thirty-six group process recordings was analyzed to identify themes in the topics discussed among group members and the leader and in group-as-a-whole interaction and behaviors. Eighteen themes were identified, graphed, compared, and charted, and the information obtained was utilized to describe what was happening in the group and to determine how what occurred fit with extant theory.  The following conclusions were reached: (1) The aggregate of women became a group. (2) The group developed cyclically. (3) The group's process was influenced by selective variables and events. (4) Nurses may require specialized skills and attributes to implement the roles and functions of a nursing home staff group leader. These conclusions had implications for group theory, nursing education, practice, and research.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY OF OLDER ADULTS: CHRONIC DYSPNEA AND SUICIDAL IDEATION IN ELDERLY MEN,Sara Lynne Horton-Deutsch,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273407W,/authors/OL5363880A/Sara_Lynne_Horton-Deutsch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 114,"The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between chronic dyspnea, suicide and suicidal ideation in elderly men. Five variables associated with dyspnea such as intense anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, life restriction and cognitive impairment, were examined to determine the relationship between chronic dyspnea and suicidal ideation in elderly men. Theoretical support for this study was drawn from propositions about dyspnea and suicide from psychology, sociology, psychiatry, and philosophy. The psychological autopsy method was used to compare elderly men with chronic dyspnea who died by suicide to living controls.  A sample of 14 older adult men was drawn from the Cook County, IL, Medical Examiner's Office and a sample of 14 older adult men was drawn from four pulmonary out-patient services in Chicago or nearby suburbs. Participants ranged in age from 61-93 years. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney tests, and Pearson correlations.  Five hypotheses tested dyspnea and suicidal ideation as dependent variables. Dyspnea was positively associated with life restriction. No relationships were found between dyspnea and intense anxiety, generalized anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Correlational analysis did not support an association between dyspnea and depression, but did support a relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and intense anxiety. No relationships were noted between suicidal ideation and other variables. Diagnostic variables which measure degree of physiological impairment were not associated with intense anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, life restriction or cognitive impairment. These findings were examined for their implications for research and practice. Recommendations were made for further research related to chronic dyspnea and suicide.

THE EFFECT OF ROLE-MODELED VISITING IN COMPARISON TO RESTRICTED VISITING ON THE WELL-BEING OF CLIENTS WHO HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY AND THEIR SIGNIFICANT FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE CRITICAL CARE UNIT,Rita Mary Holl,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273373W,/authors/OL5363852A/Rita_Mary_Holl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 227,"Establishing visiting hours that are supportive of the client and family is an important nursing intervention that nurses in the critical care unit can implement. Thus, Role-Modeled and restricted visiting were investigated to estimate their effect on clients' well-being, measured as perceived social support, perceived control, anxiety, and pain, and the significant family members' well-being, measured as need attainment and anxiety.  A convenience sample of 94 clients and 90 significant family members was studied. The client subjects had first-time non-emergency open heart surgery, were predominantly male (78%) and white (91%), and had a mean age of 58. The significant family subjects were predominantly female (85%) and white (96%) with a mean age of 53.  SPSS-X MANCOVA and MANOVA were employed to estimate the effect of the two types of visiting on client and significant family subjects' well-being. Stepwise multiple regression was conducted to investigate the predictive value of their well-being on clients' length of stay in the critical care unit.  Results of the study determined that Role-Modeled visiting had a statistically significant positive effect on the clients' perceived social support, perceived control, and anxiety, as well as the significant family members' need attainment. There were no statistically significant differences between the two types of visiting on the client subjects' pain nor the significant family subjects' anxiety. Four variables of wellness were found predictive of clients' length of stay: perceived control, family need attainment, perceived social support, and pain.

The instruments were administered within one week of the infarct and included: (a) the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) which determined the personality type of each of the subjects; (b) the Ways of Coping Questionnaire which measured the extent to which the subjects utilized eight modes of coping; and (c) a demographic data record.  The major findings of the study were: (1) Compared to the general population, ESFJ's and ISFP's were significantly overrepresented types. (2) The five most frequently used coping behaviors, in hierarchical order, were: (a) seeking social support, (b) planful problem solving, (c) positive reappraisal, (d) self-controlling, and (e) escape avoidance. (3) There was a significant positive relationship between the preference for thinking and the planful problem solving. (4) There was a significant difference between the mean scores of the preference for perception and the use of both confrontive coping and distancing. (5) Statistical significance demonstrated that extraverted intuitives used more positive reappraisal than did the introverted intuitives. (6) Analysis of demographic variables revealed that there was an inverse correlation between the number of years married and use of confrontive coping, planful problem solving, and positive reappraisal.  The findings from this study emphasize the influence that select variables can have on the coping behaviors of women whose husbands have sustained life threatening illness. Therefore, health care providers who are in a position to provide patient education services to individuals and families at critical life stages should have some basic knowledge about intraindividual factors that influence coping modalities. It would also be beneficial for patient educators to have fundamental qualifications to use the MBTI and the theory on which it is based in client sessions directed toward enhancement of coping and interpersonal skills.

AN EXPLORATION OF SYNCHRONY IN NURSING,Janet Wessel Krejci,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273168W,/authors/OL5363664A/Janet_Wessel_Krejci,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 236,"Synchrony is the inherent harmony of all connections in the universe (Jung, 1973). Theorists, researchers, and practitioners across disciplines have linked health with synchrony (Capra, 1982; Dossey, 1989a; Jung, 1973). Nurse theorists and practitioners have identified synchrony as an important aspect of nursing (Newman, 1986; Parse, 1987; Rogers, 1970). It has been proposed that movement toward synchrony increases experiences of synchronistic events, coincidence of two apparently causally unrelated events that have meaning for the individual experiencing the coincidence (Bolen, 1979; Holder, 1988; Jung, 1973).  This was an exploratory, research design based on the cooperative inquiry method (Reason & Rowan, 1981). This investigation focused on nurse experts' descriptions of synchrony in their nursing practice. Nurse experts were defined according to Benner (1984). Cues demonstrating client synchrony to nurses, descriptions of facilitation of client synchrony, synchronistic events, synchrony of the nurse as related to client synchrony, and the significance of meeting between nurse and client were examined.  Nurse experts responded congruently and enthusiastically to the concept of synchrony, even though they had not related the term to their nursing practice prior to this study. Participants believed the concept of synchrony captured part of the intangible but essential contributions of their nursing practice.  Nurse experts identified tangible and intangible cues that indicated alterations in synchrony. The participants also articulated the facilitation of synchrony in terms of the context of connection with clients. Interventions that comprised the facilitation of synchrony was conceptualized as nurses as synchroscopes.  Participants agreed that the facilitation of synchrony increased access to important ""knowing"" about their clients through synchronistic events. Moving in synchrony with a client, was then conceptualized as a way of knowing, giving nurses increased access to important information about their clients.  Although nurse experts identified the facilitation of synchrony as an extremely valuable component of their practice, they did not document this part of their practice, and they generally did not share it with others. The implications of silent voices and bringing these voices to light were discussed. The description of nurse experts was also expanded given the results of this study.

AGGRESSION IN PSYCHIATRICALLY DISORDERED CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS,Nancy Elizabeth Harnett,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273081W,/authors/OL5363587A/Nancy_Elizabeth_Harnett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 272,"In light of the current emphasis on adolescent aggression and the lack of available measurement instruments to study this phenomenon, this research project was undertaken to (a) examine the nature, range, and frequency of aggressive behaviors in psychiatrically disordered children and adolescents, (b) assess the psychometric properties of research instruments purporting to measure aggression, and (c) examine the relationship between age, gender, socioeconomic status and aggression. A developmental framework was utilized to guide this research endeavor.  The sample consisted of 32 inpatients hospitalized at a private psychiatric facility. The instruments employed in this study included: (a) The Child Behavior Checklist/Profile; (b) The Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS); (c) The Children's Overt Aggression Tool (COAT); and (d) The Hollingshead Two Factor Measure of Socioeconomic Status (SES). Findings from the study indicated significant differences in overall aggression between different age groups. There were no significant differences in aggression based on gender or socioeconomic class. Regression analysis revealed age and the absence of legal involvement to be the two strongest predictors of aggression.  The overall findings from the psychometric assessment of the instruments lent support for reliability and validity of the COAT and the MOAS, with the exception of the autoaggression subscales. Additional refinement of the autoaggression subscales and more extensive assessments of the COAT and MOAS are warranted.  The findings from this study are consistent with some aspects of developmental theory. The anticipated transient recrudescence of regressive expressions of aggression during adolescence was displayed by many of the subjects. However the degree and intensity of specific aggressive behaviors exhibited by some of the subjects were not associated with earlier stages of normal development.

The research design was a qualitative grounded theory design consisting of successive iteration of four elements: theoretical sampling, intensive interviewing, inductive analysis of the data using the constant comparative method, and development of grounded theory. The sample consisted of 29 homosexual males with HIV infection who had experience in at least one community HIV support group. Open-ended interviews were completed with each participant. Second interviews were completed with 15 of the participants, for a total of 44 interviews. Participants experienced a range of HIV symptomatology, from being asymptomatic to terminal. Six major themes were identified in the data: intimacy, alienation, self process, group process, synergistic community, and personal and societal conditions. Three grounded theory models were developed: (a) ""The Alienation Model of Group Experience,"" (b) ""The Intimacy Model of Synergistic Community,"" and (c) ""The Model of Human Association and Wellness."" Conclusions were presented as working hypotheses. Study findings were compared with extant sources in the theoretical literature, and further abstraction of the data occurred yielding the major conclusion of the study: Expanding consciousness in synergistic community is the natural progression of self in intimate I-me/other human associations, whereas illness and social fragmentation is the consequence of the self in alienating I-other human associations. Results are discussed, and recommendations for nursing practice, research, and theory development are given.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The correlates of attachment behavior, i.e., relational functioning, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression were measured by the Personal Response Questionnaire-85, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Beck's Depression Inventory. Adjustment to illness was measured by the Psychological Adjustment to Illness Scale-SR (PAIS). Randomly combined questionnaire packets were personally distributed by the investigator. A convenience sample of 116 volunteers (32 males, 84 females) from the greater New York area completed the packets.  The findings were consistent with all six hypotheses. High relational functioning and high self-esteem were inversely related to the PAIS (p $<$.0005) while low state and low trait anxiety (p $<$.005), and low depression scores (p $<$.0005) were positively related to the PAIS. These findings suggest that having a supportive, available person decreased depression and anxiety, and increased feelings of self-esteem.  Recommendations for future research include: a comparison study with a randomized healthy sample, a longitudinal investigation of trait anxiety as a factor associated with MS, and a qualitative inquiry to assess the perceived experiences of persons with MS.

EFFECTS OF NURSING STUDENT-PATIENT EXPERIENCE IN PSYCHIATRIC - MENTAL HEALTH NURSING PRACTICUM,Nadine Grace Frye,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264287W,/authors/OL5356593A/Nadine_Grace_Frye,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 143,"This study investigates a teaching strategy used in the preparation of nurses. The research questions were (1) Does the extent of the one to one nurse-patient relationship in correlation with three other selected predictors, setting, QPA and SAT, predict nursing students' P-MHN theory learning? (2) Does the extent of one to one nurse-patient relationship, in correlation with three other selected predictors, setting, QPA and P-MHN test scores, predict nursing students' empathy? These predictors were used because the literature and conventional wisdom suggest that they would have some predictive power regarding the scores on criterion variable instruments.  Consenting participants (147) were requested to make self-reports of their nurse-patient relationship experiences during four or six week P-MHN clinical practica in inpatient settings and to permit collection of demographic data and junior year P-MHN test scores which were one of two criterion variable measures. The Hogan Empathy Scale,the other criterion variable measure, was administered to undergraduate participants (62) after completion of junior year P-MHN practica.  Results of the study indicate that the variables chosen as predictors are not statistically significant in their ability to predict outcomes. The multiple regression correlation analyses reveal that predictors QPA with P-MHN theory learning and setting with both P-MHN theory learning and empathy approach significance. No variation of the one to one nurse-patient relationship is a reliable, significant predictor of nursing students' P-MHN theory learning or empathy.  This prediction research study's generalizability is restricted to students and graduates of urban university BSN programs. The study merits replication even though the study finds little evidence that either learning of P-MHN theory or empathy are predicted by the nature of the practica assignment one to one nurse-patient relationship, by hospital setting, or by previous academic achievement in college or by SAT scores.

DEVELOPMENT OF A TOOL TO ASSESS COGNITIVE MASTERY OF STRESS IN CHILDREN: A PILOT STUDY,Linda Ann Lewandowski,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264683W,/authors/OL5356942A/Linda_Ann_Lewandowski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 185,"The process of mastery of major stressors in children has been much less studied than similar processes in adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to develop and to conduct beginning testing of a new psychological measure to assess the construct of cognitive mastery of stressful events in children, i.e., the Child Cognitive Mastery Scale (CCMS). First, 22 situations involving forced-choice responses were developed around three previously-identified domains: safety and security, just and controllable world, and self-view and pictures portraying these situations were drawn. Then, 56 children, ages 6 to 11 were tested with the CCMS and a depression measure. Twenty-one children were re-tested 7 to 10 days later with the CCMS. Teachers provided ratings of school achievement and parents provided information regarding stressful life events and the child's overall behavior. Results showed evidence of overall test-retest reliability and beginning evidence of inter-administrator reliability. The results also identified some initial ""hints"" at discriminative and construct validity and seemed, for the most part, to confirm the projective assumption that the childrens' responses would reflect their own views of the world and of themselves. This initial pilot study provided some encouraging information regarding the psychometric properties of the CCMS as well as information regarding needed revisions and some directions for further evaluation and development.

PERSONALITY AND ATTITUDE CHANGE IN PSYCHIATRIC NURSING AS A FUNCTION OF NURSING EXPERIENCE,Christopher Alan Marsey,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264546W,/authors/OL5356817A/Christopher_Alan_Marsey,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 130,"The present study investigated personality and attitude changes which take place in psychiatric nurses as a function of length of experience in a psychiatric nursing setting. The participants were 59 registered nurses with various levels of nursing experience. Twenty-nine of the nurses were employed in a psychiatric setting. Thirty nurses from other fields of nursing were included for comparison purposes. All nurses were administered the Opinions About Mental Illness Scale (OMI), the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and questionnaires assessing job satisfaction, blood pressure readings, length and type of nursing experience, and demographic data.  Individual nurse scores on the measures were analyzed by use of 2 x 2 ANOVAs to assess changes in personality and attitudes regarding mental illness of the psychiatric nurse with increasing levels of experience. The personality variables, paranoia and depression, were found to remain stable with increasing levels of experience in a psychiatric nursing setting. Attitudes regarding mental illness and the mentally ill were also shown to remain stable with increasing levels of experience. Differences found between psychiatric nurses as a group and nurses from other areas of nursing revealed the psychiatric nurses to have more positive, accepting, and tolerant views of the mentally ill. Psychiatric nurses as a group, regardless of level of experience, were found to possess significantly more benevolent attitudes toward mentally ill persons than did nurses from other specialty areas. Psychiatric nurses were also found to be less supportive of placing severe restrictions upon the mentally ill than were inexperienced nurses from other fields.  The results suggest that the positive attitudes toward mental illness and the mentally ill which tend to develop during student psychiatric nursing rotations remain stable with increasing levels of experience. With regard to personality characteristics, the psychiatric nurses with low levels of experience were found to be somewhat more suspicious and cautious than inexperienced nurses from other areas of nursing. The results of this study suggest that there may be various factors which contribute to a predisposition toward choosing psychiatric nursing as an area of nursing specialization.

MATERNAL REACTIONS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF FETAL SEX BASED ON SEX PREFERENCE,Molly Kay Walker,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264675W,/authors/OL5356935A/Molly_Kay_Walker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 98,"With the advent of prenatal diagnosis, ""objective referents of personhood: sex, size and shape, condition, appearance and behavior"" (Rubin, 1984, p. 128) can be partially established. The revelation of the unborn child's sex may alter the maternal identity development and the accomplishment of maternal tasks of pregnancy described by Rubin (1984) and, consequently, alter nursing management.  A descriptive design was used to characterize maternal reactions to the knowledge of fetal sex based on sex preference. Rubin's maternal tasks of pregnancy and maternal identity concepts and the investigator-developed parental sex preference model composed the conceptual framework for the study.  The population was 300 females with singleton pregnancies who had an amniocentesis for fetal chromosome studies and met the following sample criteria: (a) fetal karyotype and other studies were normal, (b) knowledge of fetal sex desired, and (c) sex preference established. Eighty-eight subjects, 50 who attained their sex preference and 38 who did not attain their sex preference, comprised the final sample.  Maternal reactions to the knowledge of fetal sex were ascertained through an investigator-developed questionnaire which participants answer in writing. Sample characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics and the mothers' narrative responses were subjected to content analysis. The categories for content analysis were safe passage, acceptance by others, binding-in to the child, giving of oneself, replication, fantasy, and dedifferentiation.  Maternal sex preferences were equally split between males and females. However, there were differences in the way subjects who attained their sex preference and subjects who did not attain their preferred fetal sex spoke of their fetuses. It is recommended that new technology (pre-natal diagnosis techniques) and research findings be incorporated into Rubin's (1984) model and encourage the model's use as a basis for maternal assessments. Further recommendations are specific to nursing practice and research on sex preference phenomena and the effects of non-attainment on the mother, fetus/child, and family.

"RESILIENCE IN NURSING: THE RELATIONSHIP OF EGO STRENGTH, SOCIAL INTIMACY, AND RESOURCEFULNESS TO COPING",Kathleen Daly Kadner,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264398W,/authors/OL5356698A/Kathleen_Daly_Kadner,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 223,"This descriptive, correlational study examined the relationships of selected aspects of resilience, namely, ego strength, social intimacy, and resourcefulness, to coping with a purposive sample of well-educated, middle-class southwestern U.S. adults (N = 137; 79 females, 58 males). Ego strength, social intimacy, resourcefulness, and coping were measured by the Barron Ego Strength Scale (ES), Miller Social Intimacy Scale (MSIS), Rosenbaum's Self-Control Schedule (SCS), and the Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS). The JCS consists of a total coping scale, which includes three subscales measuring confrontive, emotive, and palliative coping. Demographic and scaled instrumentation data were analyzed using descriptive, univariate, and multiple regression statistics. Distribution and coefficient alpha reliability data were consistent with previous research on the ES, MSIS, SCS, and JCS scales. Significant correlations were found between gender and ES scores (r =.29, p $<$.001); person identified as closest confidant(e) and MSIS scores (r = $-.26$, p $<$.01); gender and total JCS scores (r = $-.31$, p $<$.001); number of persons in household and JCS confrontive subscale scores (r = $-.22,$ p $<$.01); health rating and ES scores (r =.32, p $<$.001); MSIS scores and SCS scores (r =.28, p $<$.01) and JCS confrontive coping scores (r =.28, p $<$.001); and SCS scores and JCS confrontive (r =.49, p $<$.001), emotive (r = $-.29$, p $<$.001), and palliative (r = $-.27$, p $<$.01) subscales. SPSS-PC stepwise regression analyses revealed gender and ES scores to be the best predictors of total coping scores (R$sp2$ =.17, p $<$.001). Confrontive coping was predicted by SCS scores, MSIS scores, numbers in household, and income data (R$sp2$ =.32, p $<$.01). Emotive coping was predicted by ES and SCS scores (R$sp2$ =.25, p $<$.01). Palliative coping was predicted by ES and SCS scores (R$sp2$ =.16, p $<$.001).  Women scored lower than men on the ES scale and higher than men on the JCS total coping scale. Emotive and palliative coping were predicted similarly, but confrontive coping was unlike any other part of coping. The findings of this study provide information about gender differences in coping and the variability in the psychosocial backgrounds of individuals reporting the use of predominantly confrontive, emotive or palliative coping strategies. The significance of the study is in its contribution to the understanding of resilience, which should facilitate clinical nursing of adults.

DEVELOPMENT AND RECOVERY OF CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY IN NURSES: A CASE STUDY AND SMALL GROUP APPROACH,Linda Rae Billington,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272874W,/authors/OL5363422A/Linda_Rae_Billington,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 126,"There were two primary purposes of this study. The first purpose focused upon the development of chemical dependency in nursing. Chemically dependent nurses were studied to determine if progression through identifiable stages in their development of the illness could be identified. The second focus of the study investigated the recovery process. Identification of components within the recovery process which aided nurses in their ability to remain abstinent and return to work were researched. Data were collected over a five year period from case notes, treatment records, employment information and interview notes to form a basis for the case study portion of the study. For the small group approach, personal interviews were conducted and audio taped from the case study and five additional chemically dependent nurses who had over two years of abstinence. These tapes were reviewed by a panel of six individual raters who used a checklist developed from Hutchinson's Substantative Theory (1986) to assess stages of development of chemical dependency. The raters used another checklist developed from an article by Zungolo and Bowers (1989) to determine stages of recovery. The raters found the participants of this study experienced some form of psychological or physical pain as a precursor to the development of chemical dependency. Hutchinson's Theory was found to have merit as a way of grouping and understanding the development of chemical dependency in nursing. The data did not support recognition by participants of specific stages. All participants had inpatient treatment, and experienced aftercare and AA. Five of the six participants were active in AA and support groups. The participants were aware of the process of recovery, however, particular stages were difficult to delineate. The data support ongoing recovery as a process which requires a support system.  Conclusions drawn from this study suggest nurses with a problematic family history and/or a history of illness are at risk to develop chemical dependency. Therefore, programs which offer support services are indicated as preventative measures.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The patient population was predominately white female, middle-class, and middle-aged, with some college education. Chart audit (N = 71), and staff interview (N = 18), were the data sources used to complement each other. Significant findings were that higher age was associated with more violence; two-way contracting was associated with less violence; there was staff agreement that environment, staffing patterns, and staff experience play important roles in violence potential on the unit; and nurses and technicians differed about which cue behaviors were important indicators of impending violence.

THE EFFECTS OF A PERCEPTUAL INTERACTION CONFERENCE ON THE SELF-CONCEPT OF ADOLESCENTS WITH SICKLE CELL ANEMIA,Brenda Joyce H.

Twelve females between the ages of 13 and 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of sickle cell anemia were randomly assigned into either the experimental or control groups. The experimental group participated in four weekly 1-hour sessions. The control group continued to receive the routine teaching offered by the agency.  Both groups were administered the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale as a pretest and posttest prior to the start of the sessions and following the last session. A Mann-Whitney U analysis indicated that the total score of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale did not differ significantly for those adolescents who participated in the sessions and those who received the routine teaching from the agency (U = 16.0, p =.818). In addition, there were no significant differences noted from the pretest to the posttest using the Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks test (T = $-$.1569, p =.785). These findings may have been the result of the small sample size.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A NURSING INVESTIGATION OF COMFORT AND COMFORTING CARE OF THE ACUTELY ILL PATIENT,Gemma Trieste Kennedy,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272677W,/authors/OL5363249A/Gemma_Trieste_Kennedy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 173,"This qualitative study explores how comfort is experienced by the acutely ill patient. An interpretive interactionism approach using ethnographic interviewing techniques was used to guide data generation and analysis.  Ten patient informants, who had been treated in an intensive care unit, were interviewed for this study. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using the methods of: capture; construction; contextualization; modified content analysis; and constant comparative method.  The results of this study revealed that individuals have unique experiences of comfort. The experience of comfort was described as: the need for comfort; the process of comfort; and the outcome of comfort. The need for comfort was individualistic and based on the resources of each patient informant. These resources included: physiology; belief in God; control of a situation; family and friends; nurses; physicians; and clergy.  The process of comfort included: the nine comfort categories that contributed to the comfort needs of the informants; the sources of support (resources) available to the patient informants; and the measures that contributed to comfort.  The nine comfort categories described were: caring attitude; being there; consistency; reassurance; physical activities; delegating control of a situation; calm feeling; and belief in God. Sources of support included: nurses; physicians; clergy; family and friends; belief in God; and the patient informants themselves. No matter who interacted with the patient informant, if the informant's perceived needs were not met, there was no comfort experience.  Measures that contributed to the acutely ill patient's comfort were more ""mental then physical."" A caring attitude was the most frequently mentioned comfort measure. Comfort also appeared to be a continuum. This continuum was based on the patient informant's resources, and having their perceived needs for comfort met.  The outcome of comfort was defined as the patient informant perceiving that his/her comfort needs were met.  The results of this study suggest that it is important to clarify the meaning of comfort with each patient. Understanding the patient's perception of comfort can help the nurse plan nursing interventions that meet the patient's perceived comfort needs.

THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF STIGMA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AIDS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION (IMMUNE DEFICIENCY),Mary Ann Thompson Donohue,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272763W,/authors/OL5363323A/Mary_Ann_Thompson_Donohue,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 384,"Individuals with AIDS have not yet been qualitatively studied as to the emotional and psychosocial toll this devastating disease has exacted upon their lives. The purpose of this phenomenological analysis was to examine the meaning of the lived experience of stigma for individuals with AIDS. The essential mission was to capture and allow to unfold the human experience of stigma.  Nine adults, ranging in age from 33-53, acknowledged that they had been diagnosed with AIDS and volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were all residents of New Jersey, living in either large industrialized cities or in suburbs of the New York City metropolitan area, and had contracted the disease from a variety of sources: intravenous drug use, promiscuous heterosexual or homosexual contact, and/or prostitution. Participants were requested to sign an informed consent and write a brief narrative about their experiences with AIDS-related stigma. Material was removed. A face-to-face tape recorded interview was arranged, with the written narrative serving as a guide for the interviewee. Transcribed data were then analyzed according to the most recent revision of the Giorgi (1985c, 1985d; personal communication, September 15, 1989) qualitative structural analytic method of phenomenological research. Every interview yielded a specific description of the situated structure which idiographically represented the lived experience of stigma for each participant. The results of this level were then analyzed and the nomothetic general description of the structure of the lived experience of stigma was generated. It is the general description which provides the answer to the research question: What is the meaning of the lived experience of stigma in individuals with AIDS? and, in its exhaustiveness, comprises the major finding of this phenomenological investigation.  Ten themes were related to the life-world at large and to Erving Goffman's (1963b) concepts about stigma. Implications for nursing as the science of caring as theorized by Jean Watson (1985) were explicated, with recommendations as to how nursing and health care may be optimized through their implementation.

"AN INVESTIGATION OF CARDIOVASCULAR, RESPIRATORY, AND SKIN TEMPERATURE CHANGES DURING RELAXATION AND ANGER INDUCTIONS",Patricia Dowling Barry,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272481W,/authors/OL5363079A/Patricia_Dowling_Barry,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 318,"This repeated measures study with 17 subjects investigated the hypotheses that sensory responses associated with emotional states of serenity (relaxation) and anger cause concomitant physiologic responses which could vary depending on subjects' emotion modulation characteristics. Changes were measured in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, heart rate (HR), respirations (R), and skin temperature (ST) responses during specific joints in relaxation, intense anger, and 3 intermediate baseline states. Analysis was done for single subject, as well as pooled data.  The specifically-requested differentiated emotional states of anger and serenity were induced by the Barry Emotion Induction Technique, an investigator-devised method. Induction effectiveness was demonstrated by comparing differences in Spielberger State Anger scores administered during baseline and intense anger states (p = $<$.0003).  Subjects were pre-classified by emotion modulation personality characteristics determined by Spielberger STAXI and Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability and Taylor Manifest Anxiety (integrated) Scales (MC/T). STAXI and MC/T scores were used to select prototypes of an anger suppressor, repressor, an expressor, whose physiologic measures were analyzed using a single subject approach.  During relaxation and anger the suppressor showed fear-type increases in SBP, DBP, HR, and R, with a decrease in ST. During relaxation the repressor showed no change in SBP, decreases in DBP, HR, and R, with an increase in ST; while angry, he showed increases in all parameters, with a decrease in ST. The expressor demonstrated decreases in all measures during relaxation. During anger he had decreases in SBP, DBP, and ST, while HR and R increased.  A majority of high scorers on STAXI Anger Control showed fear-type physiologic effects. A postieri study findings showed increases in cardiovascular responses and decreases in ST in most subjects recalling helpless anger memories; those reporting active anger memories showed decreases in cardiovascular measures and increases in ST. No trends were associated with STAXI Anger-in, Anger-out, or MC/T repressors or non-repressors.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A NEW PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CHEMICALLY-IMPAIRED NURSE IN DELAWARE,Rosalee J.

They also analyze data regarding the method of management under which the majority of nurse managers in acute care facilities in Delaware would be most likely to report a chemically impaired nurse. The results support a set of recommendations and strategies to implement a new nondisciplinary model for management of the chemically impaired nurse in Delaware.  Executive Position Paper One presents a review of the literature pertinent to chemical impairment in nurses, disciplinary and nondisciplinary alternatives used by boards of nursing to manage this problem, and the human and economic costs of the problem. The current disciplinary method used by the Delaware Board of Nursing (DBN) is found lacking in that it hinders identification, treatment, recovery, and reentry of chemically impaired nurses in Delaware. A decision is made to suggest a change to a nondisciplinary model for Delaware.  Executive Position Paper Two describes convenience samples of executive directors (EDs) of state boards of nursing and nurse managers (NMs) of acute care facilities in Delaware, questionnaires used to collect data to determine what models boards of nursing use for their management of chemically impaired nurses, the model under which nurse managers in Delaware would be most likely to report a chemically impaired nurse and their willingness to fund their choice. Twenty-one of the EDs surveyed confirmed a trend toward an increase in the use of nondisciplinary methods, and nurse managers chose a nondisciplinary model which they agreed to fund with licensure surcharge. Paper Two presents the evidence supporting Delaware's needs for a new nondisciplinary model and in a series of eight recommendations describes a plan to implement a nondisciplinary model.  Executive Position Paper Three describes the new nondisciplinary model for the management of the chemically impaired nurse in Delaware in a draft of rules and regulations for Assistance in Lieu of Discipline (ALD).  Change strategies involve the use of a task force, professional nursing groups, and legislators.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"FAMILY STRESS, PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND COPING OF FAMILY WHO HAS A CHILD WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS",Youngran Tak,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279627W,/authors/OL5368882A/Youngran_Tak,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 205,"Approximately 10% to 15% of children under 18 years of age have a chronic physical illness or condition and the number of children with chronic conditions has increased substantially in recent decades. Congenital heart disease is now the largest single group of gross congenital deformities, and it was estimated to be the second most prevalent chronic illness in children in the United States. A child with chronic illness may have effects on ongoing conditions that have pervasive consequences for family life.  Recently in family studies have explored the role of resiliency variables, especially social support, which may explain why some individuals experience higher life stresses and strains but do not show a high level of distress. Consequently, attention has shifted to social psychological factor, especially social support and coping strategy, regulating the impact of stress.  Social support is a major resiliency construct in most models of the family stress and coping process (i.e., Bristol, 1987; McCubbin, 1993; Sarason et al, 1993), where it represents the resource used by both the family and individual level. The importance perception plays in social support is evidenced by the highly consistent finding that it is the perception of social support that is most closely related to health outcomes (i.e., Antonucci & Israel, 1986). In the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation (McCubbin & McCubbin, 1993), social support is viewed as one of the primary moderators or mediators between stress and psychological well being.  The sample for this investigation is a subset of a large longitudinal study, Children's Chronic Illness: Parents and Family Adaptation conducted by M. McCubbin (1990). The subject for this study were 92 families who have a child under age 12 who was newly diagnosed with congenital heart disease within the last 3 to 4 month.  Results from correlational and hierarchial regression analyses revealed that perceived social support operated as a resiliency factor between family stress and both parental and family coping. Child and family characteristics appeared to be important predictors of perceived social support and parental coping. Even though perceived social support appeared to be an important predictor of parental and family coping, neither the moderating nor the mediating model was supported in full, however partial causal relations between family stress, perceived social support, and coping were confirmed in this study. Although the findings indicated an unsatisfactory completion of the model path proposed by this study, it should be noted that the data were subjected to more stringent analytical criteria than in previous researches. Therefore, the findings provide an incremental contribution to the explanation of effects for perceived social support and may challenge models presented in previous literature.  These findings provide evidence for the theoretical and empirical significance of perceived social support as a predictor of family coping. Further, these findings suggest that perceived social support is a factor influencing the resiliency of relatively high risk groups of families who have a child with chronic illness.

AIDS-RELATED RISK BEHAVIOR AND PERCEPTION OF PERSONAL AIDS RISK OF 18- TO 21-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENTS (IMMUNE DEFICIENCY),Emma J.

Yet, college students are inclined not to perceive their risk of contracting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, they tend not to alter their sexual and drug-use practices despite knowledge about HIV transmission and preventive measures.  The research purposes were to determine the relationship between AIDS-related risk behavior (ARRB) and AIDS knowledge, AIDS self-efficacy, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and perception of personal HIV/AIDS risk; to identify college students' perceptions of personal HIV/AIDS risk, and to determine if perception of HIV/AIDS risk differs by gender, ethnicity, or SES. The primary sample was a convenience sample of 407 18- to 21-year-old college students who attend one of two universities or a community college located in North Central Florida and who were enrolled in an undergraduate English, sociology, or mathematics course. The subsample consisted of 40 of the original participants.  The research was a descriptive observational study that used both surveys and interviews. The primary sample participated in the survey component only, while the subsample completed the survey and interview phases.  Together, perception of personal AIDS risk and AIDS self-efficacy explained 20 percent of the variance in AIDS-related risk behavior ($rm Rsp2 = 1987, F = 67.63, p < .03$). The majority (89.9 percent) of the survey sample and 82 percent of the interview subsample appraised their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS as nil or small. Their friends' risk was perceived as moderately greater than their risk, while their college peers' risk was perceived as much greater. There was no discernible difference in perception of personal AIDS risk based on gender, ethnicity, or SES.  The AIDS self-efficacy strength of 70 percent of the sample was appraised as moderate or high. About 62 percent of the students received AIDS knowledge scores between 85 and 100 percent. Sixty percent of the survey sample reported that they engaged in sexual intercourse without using condoms, and 57.5 percent engaged in sex while under the influence of alcohol.

TRAUMA AND MORAL THINKING: MILITARY NURSING IN VIETNAM,Candice Lynn Weigle-Spier,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279389W,/authors/OL5368653A/Candice_Lynn_Weigle-Spier,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 274,"A theoretical study is made of the relationships between trauma and moral thinking, with particular application to Vietnam nurse-veterans. Three literatures are reviewed in detail. The trauma literature focuses especially on combat-related trauma, and examines symptom-based and cognitive perspectives on post-traumatic phenomena. Second, the literature on the experiences of United States female military nurses in Vietnam is reviewed. A third review, of the literature on moral thinking, stresses the current debate surrounding justice-based and caring-based moralities, with a stress on the moral developments typical of young adulthood.  The study examines the effects of moral thinking on the experience of trauma, the impact of trauma on moral thinking, and the ways in which the content of Vietnam nurse-veterans' moral thinking about war is affected by combat-related trauma. I integrate contemporary theorizing about trauma and moral thinking by constructing a model of moral pathways through trauma. I theorize that such pathways, mediated by emotion, often lead the survivor to a post-traumatic morality which represents an amplification of the pre-traumatic moral stance, and which carries characteristic implications for retraumatization and healing.

THE EFFECTS OF THERAPEUTIC TOUCH ON THE GRIEF EXPERIENCE,Loretta Sue Robinson,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280732W,/authors/OL5369859A/Loretta_Sue_Robinson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 90,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Therapeutic Touch (TT) on grief. Dying is an inevitable process, which leaves an estimated 16 to 20 million new mourners each year to deal with grief (Hocker, 1989; Redmond, 1989). Research suggests grief may adversely effect an individual's physical and mental well-being (Lindemann, 1944; Rando, 1993; Raphael, 1983). A convenience sample of 22 recently bereaved adults was randomly assigned to a control or experimental group, each consisting of 11 subjects. Control subjects received 3 consecutive mimic treatments, while the experimental subjects received 3 consecutive TT treatments. Initially demographic data were collected from all subjects. The Grief Experience Inventory (GEI) was used to measure the grief experience. Each subject completed the GEI and indicated any additional type of grief assistance they were concurrently receiving prior to the first treatment, at the end of the third treatment, and again at 1 and 9 weeks following the third treatment. Subjects were also asked to describe the effects of the treatments on their grief at the 9 week interval. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and a summary of subject responses were used to analyze the data. A post hoc power analysis indicated an adequate sample size to identify any clinically significant subjects more frequently reported favorable effects on their grief than control subjects. It is concluded TT had a beneficial effect on the grief experience for these individuals. Recommendations for future research include study replication, investigation of the timing and strength of TT, further qualitative data collection, and study of the combined effects of TT with other grief interventions.

"DIMENSIONS OF UNDERSTANDING IN CROSS-CULTURAL NURSE-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS: A QUALITATIVE NURSING STUDY (IMMIGRANTS, COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH)",Margaret Eva Osborne,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280340W,/authors/OL5369495A/Margaret_Eva_Osborne,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 207,"During the last two decades European immigration to Canada has decreased while the number of immigrants from Asia and Latin America has increased (Canadian Task Force on the Mental Health Needs of Immigrants and Refugees, 1988). The potential for cross-cultural misunderstanding is evident given the differences in the explanatory models of mental health and illness between these immigrants and the dominant Canadian culture. Consequently, the health needs for this client population may be unmet and services not utilized. Even though nursing plays a major role in the provision of mental health care where nurse-client encounters are the focus of practice, there has been little published research about the cross-cultural interactional process.  The purpose of this study was to describe and explore what constitutes understanding within the cross-cultural nurse-client relationship, in the context of mental health-psychiatric nursing practice. The conceptual orientation for the study was based upon the sensitizing concepts of explanatory model (Kleinman, 1978) and caring (Watson, 1988, Gadow, 1988, Noddings, 1984).  A naturalistic, descriptive research design, incorporating multiple, intensive, semi-structured, ethnographic interviews and participant observations was used. Seven nurse-client dyads, from two community psychiatric rehabilitation programs participated in the study. Thematic analysis was used to induct dimensions of understanding in cross-cultural nurse-client encounters. The impact of the nurse's and client's explanatory models of mental health and illness on the development of understanding, and factors which facilitated or impeded the development of understanding were generated through techniques of domain analysis and constant comparison.  Study findings suggested that understanding was comprised of five dimensions. The dimensions clustered into two groups: core dimensions were behaviors which gave entry into and enabled the cultural negotiation of the care process; and secondary dimensions that were behaviors essential to supporting the facilitation of the core dimensions. Core dimensions were managing the language barrier and the exploration of explanatory models of mental health and mental illness. Essential, supportive dimensions were commitment to a human to human relationship, connecting in a culturally sensitive way and taking time. The greater the degree the dimensions existed, in interaction with each, the greater the possibility that the cultural negotiation of care goals was possible.  Three areas of relevance for nursing were: (1) the multi-dimensional, complexity of the cross-cultural interactional process; (2) further contribution to nursing's body of knowledge on caring; (3) the usefulness of the explanatory model concept in eliciting the influences of personal/professional knowing and the environment as factors impacting the development of understanding.

"STRESS, STRESS RELATED DEPRESSION, AND BURNOUT: THEIR EFFECTS ON NURSES AND HOLISTIC PATIENT CARE",Loucinda Cindy Marie Wamsley,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280623W,/authors/OL5369764A/Loucinda_Cindy_Marie_Wamsley,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 198,"A proportionate random sample of 250 registered nurses in Johnson County, Kansas, were assessed for stress, stress related depression, burnout and their potential affects of these nurses and holistic patient care. Stress and stress related depression were measured by using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and burnout and quality of patient care were measured by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Demographic variables including age, years of experience, and type of work within the medical arena were also assessed by using the MBI.  Analysis of variance used to determine the relationship and correlation between the BDI scores and the MBI was conducted by using the Spearman Brown Rank Correlation Coefficient and the Kruskal Wallis Test.  The calculation of stress and stress related depression in the survey population by the BDI indicated 67.2% of these registered nurses were suffering from mild to moderated depression. Similarly, from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, nurses responding to the questionnaire indicated that 34.8% were suffering from high emotional exhaustion, 32.8% high depersonalization, and 34,45 low personal accomplishment. Non Parametric tests using Spearman Brown and Kruskal Wallis indicate positive correlation between stress levels as calculated using the BDI, and burnout as measured by MBI. This may be a good indicator that with the identified direct association of burnout and depression, a sizable portion of these nurses--perhaps over a third--are either 'withdrawing' from the profession or their patients. This has significant implications for holistic patient care.  Insights from this study provide a reference point for development of a data base for training programs oriented toward educating nurses and their supervisors in a variety of topics from self actualization, awareness, critical thinking, stress, stress related depression, burnout, and, ultimately, their affects on holistic patient care.

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING INSIGHT AND FINDING MEANING WITHIN PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA,Marjorie Baier,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280952W,/authors/OL5370052A/Marjorie_Baier,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 188,"Persons with schizophrenia who possess insight about the illness have the advantage of being able to participate in their own treatment. Their search for meaning enables them to transcend the illness as described by Travelbee. This qualitative study, conducted within the naturalistic paradigm and based upon the tenets of symbolic interactionism and humanistic psychology, included interviews with 26 persons with schizophrenia to learn about their experiences with insight and meaning.  Content analysis of the interviews, using themes identified from the literature and from the interviews themselves, resulted in a conceptual framework with nine components of insight. These components were used to assess the level of insight of those persons who were interviewed. Themes of meaning were stigma, personal losses, emotional states/lack of control, relationships/alienation, coping methods, and the future course of the illness.  Persons with schizophrenia described insight as an awareness that their hallucinations and delusions were a distortion of reality. They had developed insight by taking medication, by having consistent family support, and by participating in day treatment for a long period of time. Finding meaning in the illness involved (a) determining to what degree they had control of the illness, (b) recognizing that schizophrenia was only one part of their life, and (c) accepting the fact that living with schizophrenia required courage and persistence. Making new friends and planning for the future represented coming to terms with the illness.  The importance of this study arises from the poignant accounts of the cognitive impairments and the depth of the pain experienced by persons with schizophrenia. These accounts facilitate an empathic approach to teaching and involving the patient, family, and friends in treatment and rehabilitation. Insight emerged as a multidimensional construct, more complex than previously described. Further research about insight and the meaning of illness is needed.

LONELINESS IN MOTHERS OF BOYS WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY: CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY,Michele F. Phillips,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280767W,/authors/OL5369882A/Michele_F._Phillips,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 169,"Mothers of children with both severe disabling conditions and chronic illnesses have been known to express a myriad of negative emotions that are associated with their maternal role and particular situation. Scholars have described these mothers as alienated and socially isolated (Gayton, 1975; Loebig, 1990; Patterson, 1988). These mothers are also described as receiving less social support and having fewer social network members than mothers of children without disabilities (Florian & Krulik, 1991; Kazak, Reber, Carter, 1988).  There is, as well, a pervasive theme of loneliness that runs through the literature on mothers of children with severe disabling conditions. This loneliness is often listed as a confounding or co-existing variable but is rarely the focus of the study. There is a lack of empirical work and alternative theoretical explanations examining this phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms in these mothers.  To study this phenomenon Yin's (1984) case study methodology was used to examine the nature of loneliness and the relevance of two theoretical explanations, Weiss' interactional and Peplau and colleagues (1982) cognitive model in five mothers of boys with this disease.  A surprisingly consistent finding across cases was the absence of loneliness. The development of loneliness was precluded in these mothers due to an intense primary relationship with their son. The lack of loneliness could be explained by the two theoretical viewpoints. The cognitive view on loneliness (Peplau & colleagues, 1982) provided the thrust of the explanation along with central concepts from the theoretical view presented by Weiss (1973). This study determined that the perception of loneliness was not felt by these mothers and the presence of a primary relationship between the mother and son was thought to preclude its development.

To improve the general health and self-care of persons with major psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of their health practices is needed. This descriptive, two-group comparison study compared differences in experiences of a common illness, symptom perceptions, and self-care practices of persons with schizophrenia and persons without a psychotic disorder. The conceptual framework used for the study was the Self-Regulation Model of Health Behavior.  Schizophrenic patients (N = 30), recruited from a psychiatric outpatient clinic were matched with persons (N = 30) having no history of schizophrenic symptoms on variables of gender, age, race, and employment status. Research questions addressed were differences in: (1) conceptual representation of a common illness; (2) physical symptom experiences and descriptions of common illness symptoms; and (3) self-care and preventive health practices. Data were collected using a common illness interview, a card sort of selected symptoms, Somatic Symptom Index, Health Promoting Life-style Profile, and Health Risk Appraisal. Information on current health problems and treatments were also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive methods and Student's t-test or Chi Square analysis for group comparisons.  The following differences were found: (1) the schizophrenia group verbalized significantly less content knowledge, had more impoverished cognitive networks, less frequently mentioned painful symptoms, were somewhat less abstract in discussing treatments, and had a limited ability to judge changes in health status; (2) on average, one symptom more per person was reported in the schizophrenia group reported, attributable to psychotropic medication side effects; and (3) preventive health and self-care behaviors differed on selected measures.  These results suggest that cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia influences symptom interpretation and behavior. Schizophrenic subjects had less ability to assess changes in health status, which may negatively influence health seeking decisions during acute illness, and seemed less likely to engage in preventive behaviors requiring individual initiative.

MAIEUTIC DIMENSIONS OF SELF-CARE AGENCY: INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT (HEALTH CARE),Nancy Ann O'Connor,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280249W,/authors/OL5369407A/Nancy_Ann_O'Connor,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 275,"The purpose of this study was to construct and validate an instrument designed to measure selected capabilities and dispositions foundational to self-care agency, conceptualized as the ""Maieutic Dimensions of Self-Care Agency."" Descriptive, correlational, methods were used within a longitudinal design, with data collected at two time points, 4 weeks apart. The instrument, known as the ""Maieutic Dimensions of Self-Care Agency Scale"" (MDSCAS) was designed within Orem's General Theory of Nursing as a nursing sensitive outcome measure for use in educative and supportive nursing systems in which the outcome of interest is enhancement of the self-care capabilities of adults.  Evidence of the instrument's reliability and validity in a sample of 616 adults who receive health care from nurse practitioners is reported. Evidence for construct validity was examined using factor structure and theoretical modelling approaches. Relationships among the Maieutic Dimensions of Self-Care Agency, the Power to Perform the Productive Operations of Self-Care Agency as measured by the Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale (ASA-A) and the Basic Conditioning Factors of age, gender, developmental level and health state are reported. Both internal consistency reliability and short-term stability were achieved for the new instrument. Factor structure was confirmed as posited for the major dimensions and subscales of the MDSCAS-S.  The sample consisted predominantly of African-Americans and European-Americans, with 10% of the sample reporting Asian-American/Pacific Islander as their ethnic background. The sample was well-educated and professionally employed with a median age of 39 years. In order to provide some normative measurements for the major study variables, descriptive statistics categorized by age, gender, and health state are provided for the two dimensions of self-care agency and global well-being.  Particular attention was devoted to exploring implications of the study for directing further inquiry into enhancing the self-care capabilities of adults.

EFFECT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PREPARATION ON REDUCING BEHAVIORAL DISTRESS AND MORBIDITY IN CHILDREN UNDERGOING ENDOSCOPY,Alan Drew Schnee,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280742W,/authors/OL5369869A/Alan_Drew_Schnee,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 153,"The effectiveness of a parent-administered psychological treatment package on reducing distress in children undergoing upper endoscopy was compared to a counseling intervention and to the standard medical procedure. Fifty-three children were involved in the study. The experimental package included training in hypnosis, rapid muscle relaxation and deep breathing exercises. This was the first study to examine distress in children urdergoing endoscopy and the first study to attempt to reduce related distress. Observational, physiological and self-report measures were employed.  The results indicated that children demonstrated significant levels of distress during the endoscopy. Outcome measures did not support the use of the parent administered psychological intervention. However, clinical observations tend to suggest that the intervention may not have been administered adequately leaving in question its true effectiveness. The discussion focuses on the difficulty parents had in administering the intervention, particularly when their children were distressed.

Sixty adults with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, aged 21 to 56 years, composed the convenience sample. Data were collected through a tertiary care medical center clinic, a clinic of physicians in private practice, and regional coordinators of health services for those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Social support was assessed using the Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ) 85 Part II; self-esteem was assessed by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; symptom distress was assessed by the Symptom Distress Scale; and anxiety was assessed by the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (STAI Form Y-1, S-Anxiety Scale).  Hypotheses were tested using Pearson correlations and multiple regression analysis. Analysis of the relationship between social support and self-esteem revealed a positive correlation (r =.41, p $leq$.01); between social support and anxiety a negative correlation (r = $-$.31, p $leq$.05); between self-esteem and symptom distress a negative correlation (r = $-$.58, p $leq$.0001); between self-esteem and anxiety a negative correlation (r = $-$.70, p $leq$.0001); and between symptom distress and anxiety a positive correlation (r =.68, p $leq$.0001). No significant relationship was shown between social support and symptom distress. Multiple regression analysis revealed two significant predictors of anxiety, self-esteem, and symptom distress, which together accounted for 61% of the variance in anxiety.  Findings from this study supported the usefulness of the Roy Adaptation Model for describing adaptation in adults with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The need for further research with other samples of adults with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was suggested.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"DECISION MAKING CONTEXT, SELF-REPORTS, AND PATTERNS OF INFORMATION USE IN JUDGMENTS OF MEDICATION ACCEPTANCE",Celia Emily Wills,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280481W,/authors/OL5369627A/Celia_Emily_Wills,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 211,"Better understanding of consumer judgment and decision making processes about health treatments is necessary to aid the development of decision making assessments and interventions for collaborative work with consumers who are making health treatment decisions. In this study, the relationships among treatment history variables, semistructured interview responses, patterns of information use in judgments of medication acceptance for hypothetical scenarios, relative importance ratings of information used in scenarios, and the decision making context were examined. Three groups of people were compared who differed on whether or not they had personally experienced mental health difficulties (MHCs sample, n = 89), allergies or asthma (A/A sample, n = 90) or no chronic health conditions (No CHCs sample, n = 89) for which medication had been prescribed.  There were both differences and similarities between clinical samples for responses to interview questions regarding people's perceptions about actual health conditions, treatment, and health care providers. MHCs participants were more likely than A/A participants to mention negative feelings about dependence on medications, adverse changes in personality and behavior associated with medication use, and social stigma issues. In contrast, A/A participants were more likely than MHCs participants to focus on the adverse lifestyle impact of treatment, ""physical"" side effects of medications, and the expense of medications. Interview responses were found to be predictive of the incidence of treatment and medication discontinuation and refusal, depression symptoms as measured by the CESD scale, and the importance assigned to information in judgments of medication acceptance for hypothetical scenarios. Self-reports of the relative importances of information were predictive of the effects of information on judgments of medication acceptance. The findings imply that decision making assessments for use in clinical settings should be comprehensive and include those factors which are likely to feature prominently in decision making for a given health treatment context. The results also imply that further research on the relationships between self-reports and patterns of information use in health treatment decision making is needed to facilitate continued theory development regarding health treatment decision making processes.

"THE ILLNESS ATTRIBUTIONS OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (COPING, DEPRESSION)",Melinda Louise Bale,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280721W,/authors/OL5369849A/Melinda_Louise_Bale,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 127,"This exploratory study investigated (a) how 24 women with breast cancer attributed causality for the disease when a certain and specific biomedical cause is lacking, (b) the relationship between attributions and adjustment, and (c) their personal narratives revealed through the attribution process. Attributions were examined for their content significance, temporality, stability, function, origin, and emotional impact. Data were collected through semi-structured home interviews, which included a writing exercise, brief personal history, and completion of the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale.  It was found that while only nine women (38%) asked themselves ""why me?"" at or near the time of diagnosis, 22 (92%) generated attributions during the interview. The most common attributions were Hormones (41%), Environmental Exposure (32%), Stress (32%), Heredity (23%), and Emotions (23%). Among women who gave multi-causal attributions, Heredity, Unknown Causes, and Hormones were most often assigned the highest percentage of contribution to the development of their cancers. Ideas about causation were provided mostly by the media and appeared to be relatively stable over time. While neatly half the women said their attributions left them feeling angry (45%) or depressed (41%), they also suggested ways to prevent recurrence and to cope with the disease and treatment.  The majority of women (63%) who were coping adequately (having Fighting Spirit) tended to generate External attributions (e.g., environmental exposures, hormones) and those women who showed the adequate coping (having Anxious, Helpless/Hopeless, and Fatalistic coping) tended to attribute their breast cancer to risk factors cited by the American Cancer Society. Self attributions were found among both types of coping styles. The significance women assigned their attentions appeared not to affect coping. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small sample size, large standard deviations, and lack of representativeness of the sample.  Three composite case studies illustrated the personal and culturally shared context out of which attributions and meanings of illness arise. These narratives highlighted sources of conflict, fear, anxiety, strength, and hope and how illness meanings are transferred from a woman's life experience to her experience of illness. Implications for psychosocial intervention and research are presented.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
STRESS AND COPING OF CAREGIVERS TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA,Karen Annette Jensen,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281081W,/authors/OL5370177A/Karen_Annette_Jensen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 227,"Considerable literature exists on the presence of burden among caregivers, however, it has also been discovered that individuals psychologically adapt to situations in which they are involved. The purpose of this study is, utilizing an adaptation paradigm, to examine the interrelationship of factors in the caregiver's environment and the mediating role of coping mechanisms on appraisal of caregiving. The theoretical framework to guide this study was based on Roy's Adaptation model in conjunction with Lazarus and Folkman's cognitively-based theory of stress and coping. Data were collected from 129 caregivers, either wives or daughters, caring for a demented individual in their home. Instruments utilized in the study included: Global Self-Rated Health Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Personal Views Survey, Lubben Social Network Scale, Memory and Behavior Checklist, Ways of Coping (Revised), and Caregiver Appraisal Tool. This study utilized a quasi-experimental design employing structural equation modeling based on Lazarus and Folkman's cognitively-based theory of stress and coping and the Roy Adaptation model of nursing to determine appraisal of the caregiving role.  The final model demonstrated the complex inter-relationship of factors in determining appraisal of the caregiving. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI.92) and Normed Fit Index (NFI.90). suggest the revised model represented adequate fit to the data. The model demonstrated that the physical health of the caregiver, patient problem behaviors, emotion and problem-focused coping had a direct significant relationship on appraisal of the caregiving role. Indirect relationships to appraisal, through problem and emotion-focused coping included depression, hardiness, social support and spirituality. The model did provide support for the Roy Adaptation model which asserts the intermediary role of coping mechanisms on appraisal of the caregiving role. The study offered preliminary confirmation that appraisal of the caregiving role can include positive aspects for caregivers and the need to investigate possible stages of caregiving.

NURSE-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP AND PROCESS OF RECOVERY IN SCHIZOPHRENIC INPATIENTS,Dianne Pelletier Raymond,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281101W,/authors/OL5370196A/Dianne_Pelletier_Raymond,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 91,"Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder of social significance requiring a high degree of community resources and health care expenditures. Recovery from an acute psychotic episode is a critical period in the treatment of schizophrenia. Nursing interventions that effectively support clients during this recovery period are crucial. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe the nurse-client relationship and the process of recovery in schizophrenic inpatients.  Four research questions were addressed. Two questions related to the phases of the nurse-client relationship and to the sequences of action/interaction in the recovery process. The remaining two questions focused on clients' perspectives on effectiveness of nursing interventions and self-regulatory mechanisms.  Qualitative data were collected from the hospital charts of 16 schizophrenic inpatients experiencing psychosis. The study included nine individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Seven were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. The entire hospital stay of the 16 participants from admission to discharge was tracked. Twelve of the 16 participants were interviewed. The interview questions focused on admission, course of hospitalization, and discharge. Clients were asked to identify helpful, self-help, and unhelpful interventions.  Peplau's nurse-client relationship phases served as organizing categories for the data. The chart data and interview data were analyzed using content analysis. Themes which emerged in the early phases included hope/hopelessness, fear, power/control, anger, self-esteem/self-worth, and loneliness. Two themes, coping and denial, emerged in the later phases reflecting two distinct subgroups. Nursing interventions in the early phases focused on meeting lower level needs, while those in the later phase focused on higher level needs. The interview data revealed that clients identified numerous helpful staff and self-help interventions and fewer unhelpful interventions. Findings suggest that treatment which is both standardized, yet individualized, may produce the best outcomes. Further, the study design suggest a mechanism for the development of critical pathways for the care of psychiatric clients.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
NURSE-PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS IN CHILD PSYCHIATRIC UNITS (MILIEU THERAPY),Kathleen Mary Scharer,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281090W,/authors/OL5370186A/Kathleen_Mary_Scharer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 189,"The relationships that develop between nursing staff and parents in child psychiatry units were examined using grounded theory methodology. Semi-structured interviews and participant observation were used to collect data over an 11 month period. Twenty-one pairs of parents and nursing staff who were interacting were interviewed separately. The researcher conducted participant observation in three settings and interviews were conducted at two of these settings.  These interviews were transcribed verbatim. Field notes were made following each participant observation period. Both the interview transcripts and the field notes were analyzed using a computer program, NUDIST, to code data into categories. Data were then compared and then category reduction was used to integrate the categories and their properties. From the process a middle range theory was developed.  The findings revealed that nurse-parent relationships have two stages during the child's typical 10-14 day hospital stay. The first phase of admission is a critical one from both the parent's and nursing staff's perspectives. The admission phase is influenced by the expectations of staff and parents and the routines of the unit. The second phase is the working phase. During the working phase, four patterns of interactions were noted: engagement, disengagement, failure to engage and working alliance. Engagement occurred when the parent and nurse were able to sustain interaction, including physical presence and emotional availability. Defining characteristics of engagement included honesty, caring, respect, trust and a sense of the others' competency. Failure to engage occurred when sustained interaction was not possible. Disengagement occurred if either the parent or nurse had engaged and were then unable to sustain interaction either due to circumstantial reason, such as a scheduled vacation, or an emotional disruption to the relationship. Working alliance seemed to be an extension of engagement that occurred when there was an unusual duration or intensity in the nurse parent relationship, where both parent and nurse had a sense of mutuality in the relationship and both were willing to go the extra mile for the child.

ATTENTION PROCESS TRAINING: ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN REMEDIATING ATTENTION AND MEMORY DEFICITS FOLLOWING MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY,Julia Nobelungu Mekwa,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281295W,/authors/OL5370375A/Julia_Nobelungu_Mekwa,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 317,"Traumatic brain injury is an insult to the brain capable of producing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and vocational changes. Statistics show a rapid increase in the number of brain injuries each decade in both developed and developing countries. Disorders of memory and attention are among those regarded as most prominent following non-penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Attention Process Training (APT) in remediating attention deficits and memory dysfunctions following mild TBI.  A convenience sample of four (three females, one male) automobile accident survivors with mild TBI underwent APT. Baseline data was obtained over a period of 3-6 sessions (one session per day), randomly assigned to the four subjects. The RAPT and the PASAT were utilized to measure baseline performance in attention. To obtain baseline data for memory performance, the CVLT, the Rey CFT, and the PROMS, were used. The APT-II Questionnaire was used to obtain baseline data on perceived difficulty of attentional problems in everyday life. The intervention consisted of APT auditory and visual attention tasks administered over four alternate (ABAB) study phases, each approximately 3 weeks long, a total of 12-14 weeks. To obtain post-training performance in attention, measures included the RAPT, PASAT, DVT, and the MTVAT. The CVLT, Rey CFT, and PROMS were used to measure outcomes on memory performance. The APT-II Questionnaire, the APT-II Attention Lapse and Success Log, including probes, were used to measure generalization to naturalistic settings. To analyze data, mean outcome scores were compared with baseline scores.  Findings on the RAPT suggested increased performance in divided attention for all four subjects. Increased performance was also suggested for two subjects in sustained, selective, and alternating levels of visual attention, and for one subject in auditory alternating attention. Findings on the PASAT suggested a more general increase for all subjects. In contrast, findings on the DVT and MTVAT suggested very limited increases in performance. The rate of response was found to be a more efficient measure for assessing attention performance in the mild TBI sample. Modality specificity was suggested only by the DVT data.  Findings on the Rey CFT showed an increased performance in figure reproduction and in the organization of visual information. Data from the CVLT suggested increased performance for two subjects in immediate recall and reduction of perseverations. Limited increases occurred in short-delay recall, consistency of item recall, target recognition, and reduction of false positive responses. There was no increase in verbal organization as determined by the semantic clustering ratio of the CVLT. Higher performance in prospective memory occurred in associative-cued compared to time-cued tasks. The Rey CFT showed better performance in delayed-recall compared to immediate and short-term recall. There was evidence of moderate generalization of behavior to naturalistic settings. In summary, findings suggested the APT was selectively effective in remediating attention and memory deficits for mild TBI. More research is recommended to validate these findings.

Variables measured in the questionnaires were trait anxiety, depression, coping style, adaption in relationship, and level of differentiation of self. Results demonstrated significant differences in level of differentiation of self (p $<$.005) and coping styles (p $<$.02).

A semi-structured interview guide consisting of 22 items previously piloted by the investigator was utilized to elicit in-depth information regarding the psychiatric nurses' experiences with assaultive patients and the nurses' responses to that assault experience. Demographic information was also collected to provide a background profile of this sample of nurses.  A purposive sample of 30 psychiatric nurses working in adult, in-patient settings representing a four-state Midwestern region was obtained from responses to advertisements placed in a professional, bimonthly newsletter circulated throughout the northern Illinois and Northwestern Indiana region. In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted and analyzed by the investigator using the grounded theory approach for qualitative data and The Ethnograph software for the computer-assisted analysis of text based data.  The findings suggested that psychiatric nurses experienced responses to patient assault similar to those responses of women criminally victimized outside the clinical setting. Seven cognitive strategies were utilized by this sample of nurses to help minimize the emotional and physical impact of patient assault. The presence or absence of peer support was identified as major factor impacting nurses' recovery from the sequelae of patient assault. Recommendations for nursing practice emphasized utilizing the expertise of the nurse clinical specialist who was perceived as being best suited to facilitate the processing of traumatic nurse-patient interactions; and who was best able to assist nurses in resolving the physical and psychological sequelae of assault. However, psychiatric nurses noted that this position was often the first cut by organizations during periods of cost-containment.  While nurses concluded that it was the organization's responsibility to provide aggression management programs designed to provide clinical staff with strategies to safely manage aggressive patient behaviors; the techniques were often viewed as being difficult to implement during crisis situations with infrequent or nonexistent ""hands-on"" review sessions. Administrators and organizations were perceived by this sample of psychiatric nurses as being primarily interested in the ""bottom line"" (fiscal needs of the organization) regardless of the consequences to nursing staff.

A ""Goodness of Fit"" model was used as the theoretical framework for the study to examine how the study variables were displayed in the two adolescent family groups and how these variables were related to adolescent depression.  The study sample included 40 families of adolescents: 12 families of hospitalized adolescents, and 28 families of ""normal"" high school adolescents. A cross-sectional analysis was used to compare the two study groups for differences on the study variables. For each family self-report data was collected from the mother, father, and adolescent on perceptions of parenting practices, child temperament, and depression. Instruments included the Family Environment Scale (FES), the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey (DOTS-R), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and a demographic checklist. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney tests, and Spearman correlation coefficients.  The results of the study indicated that mothers, fathers, and adolescents reported less warmth/cohesion in parenting practices, adolescents and mothers were more depressed, and adolescents reported less organization in their parents parenting practices than did the comparison group. In addition, self-reports of temperament from the hospitalized group of adolescents were not significantly different from self-reports of temperament in the non-hospitalized group of adolescents. However, parents' reports of their adolescent's temperament were significantly different between the two groups, in that the hospitalized group of parents reported more difficult temperaments in their adolescents. These findings were examined for their implications for research and practice. Recommendations were made for further investigation of characteristics of parent/adolescent relationships in families of depressed hospitalized adolescents.

VERY LOW BIRTHWEIGHT INFANT TEMPERAMENT 6 TO 8 MONTHS OF AGE ON FAMILY UNIT HEALTH,Deborah Brown Nelson,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278628W,/authors/OL5368006A/Deborah_Brown_Nelson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 116,"The purpose of this study was to determine if differences in family unit health existed between family units with very low birthweight (VLBW) infants when compared with full-term infant family units. Thirty-seven mothers of second born children were recruited for study. Included were 15 family units of 6- to 8-month-old VLBW infants and 22 full-term infant family units.  An ex-post facto descriptive design was selected to examine infant behavioral style and its relationship of family unit health within the two family units. Barnhill's (1979) theory of health family dynamics, as a mutually causal system, examined family dynamics across six dimensions of health and psychopathology and included: (a) individuation-enmeshment, (b) clear communication-unclear communication, (c) stability-disorganization, (d) flexibility-rigidity, (e) mutuality-isolation, and (f) role reciprocity-role conflict. Barnhill's theory provided the organizing framework for this study. Five dimensions of Carey and McDevitt's (1978) infant temperament scale were employed to examine infant behavioral style and included: rhythmicity, approach, adaptability, intensity, and mood. Full-term infant family units were found to be healthier on all six dimensions of family dynamics; however, statistical significance was not achieved at the.05 level. When the behavioral styles of the two infant groups were compared, statistical significant differences did not exist on any of the five dimensions of infant behavioral style at the.05 level. Family dynamic scores and behavioral style scores were combined for the two family units and correlations determined. Approach correlated with stability-disorganization (r = 3.77, p =.022) and role reciprocity-role conflict (r =.466, p =.004). Adaptability correlated with stability-disorganization (r =.328, p =.028) and mood with role reciprocity-role conflict (r =.403, p=.013).  Nine statistically significant correlation coefficients were generated within the six dimensions of family dynamics. By improving one dimension of family dynamics, other dimensions were improved, thus supporting a system of mutual causality.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"SEX, DRUGS AND T-CELLS: SYMBOLIC MEANINGS AMONG GAY MEN WITH ASYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTION (IMMUNE DEFICIENCY)",Richard Charles Macintyre,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278609W,/authors/OL5367987A/Richard_Charles_Macintyre,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 419,"This interpretive phenomenological study of gay men with asymptomatic HIV-infection examined how experiences with HIV infection, and beliefs about health, illness, HIV, immune function monitoring and treatment options, shaped personal meanings and coping patterns. The study design included in-depth conversations with asymptomatic HIV-positive gay men. Transcriptions of these conversations and field notes were treated as meaningful texts.  Both health-seeking and high-risk behaviors were explored within the context of the thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and experiences related to living with asymptomatic HIV infection in the gay community. Narrative accounts of lived experiences were elicited through 17 in-depth, semi-structured conversations supplemented by extensive participant-observation data including conversations with and observations of gay men in the investigator's extended social network.  While interview topics and lines of inquiry were established beforehand, they were subordinated to the issues and concerns of the participants. Four paradigm case stories are presented to introduce the ongoing informal discourse among gay men with asymptomatic HIV infection. A major purpose of the study was to articulate that discourse so that it might proceed more publicly, be taken more seriously; develop more fully and contribute more meaningfully to an understanding of gay men living with asymptomatic HIV infection. To this end, ideologies about health and illness were explored in relation to standard and alternative health practices.  Participants included both men who were not monitoring their T-cells and those who were. Health care in general and T-cells in particular held a variety of symbolic meanings for the participants. Symbolic meanings for T-cells ranged from a ""male fetishism"" with meaningless numbers to an absolute indication of one's level of health; from normalized nonsense to report cards. The power of these symbols was evident in the emotional and behavioral reactions they evoked--terror, denial, anxiety, anger, sadness, despair, uncertainty and self-doubt. But T-cell counts, whether relatively high or simply stable, sometimes functioned to provide a measure of hope, providing both a weapon against overwhelming uncertainty and an impetus for lifestyle and treatment changes.

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PERCEIVED SEVERITY OF BEHAVIORAL DISTURBANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR BEHAVIORAL DISTURBANCE TO BURDEN AMONG PRIMARY CAREGIVERS OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA,Helene L. Provencher,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278759W,/authors/OL5368128A/Helene_L._Provencher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 211,"For a majority of families, taking care of a relative with schizophrenia is a stressful and demanding experience. This correlational study design was used to investigate the relationship of the perceived severity of behavioral disturbance and responsibility attribution for behavioral disturbance to burden among primary caregivers of persons with schizophrenia. A convenience sample of 70 primary caregivers responded to self-report questionnaires.  The primary caregivers reported moderate levels of objective burden, attributable objective burden, and subjective burden. They perceived mild behavioral disturbance and, in particular, mild positive and negative disturbing behaviors. Similar to responsibility attribution for positive and negative disturbing behaviors, a minimal level of responsibility for disturbing behaviors was attributed to the patient. The primary caregivers might have reached an end plateau of moderate and chronic burden in coping with a relatively stabilized schizophrenia patient.  The severity of behavioral disturbance was significantly related to objective burden, attributable objective burden, and subjective burden. These findings suggest that the severity of behavioral disturbance is still an important correlate of burden even at a chronic stage of the illness. The significant relationship between the severity of positive disturbing behaviors and attributable objective burden might reflect the presence of abusive behaviors in this behavioral category. The significant relationship between the severity of negative behaviors and both objective burden and attributable objective burden suggests that the patient's behavioral deficits might have a disruptive impact on the family.  The minimal responsibility attributed to the patient for disturbing behaviors is congruent with a predominant illness view and the use of empathy. Similar to responsibility attribution for negative disturbing behaviors, responsibility attribution for behavioral disturbance was only significantly related to objective burden. A possible sick role attributed to the patient might have generated some imbalance in the reallocation of family roles. The absence of a significant relationship between the responsibility attribution for positive disturbing behaviors and burden might reflect the potential strong belief in pharmacological agents to control the occurrence of these disturbing behaviors. The homogeneity of the sample might have prevented the report of significant relationships between a set of demographic variables and duration of illness to burden.

HOMEBOUND TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS PROGRAM,Elaine Maccormac,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278613W,/authors/OL5367992A/Elaine_Maccormac,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 423,"This study explored the effectiveness of homebound family therapy in preventing rehospitalization of patients with a major psychiatric disorder and did a comparative analysis between German-American patients residing in the Greater Ridgewood Area and the Greek-American patients residing in the Astoria-Long Island City area.  Homebound family therapy was provided for seven German-American patients and their families and for five Greek-American patients and their families. Patients were selected from the state's hospital inpatient wards or outpatient clinics. The patients were diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder, had one previous hospitalization and were between the ages of 18-65. The patients were in the program for a minimum of one year, and all but one remained longer at the patient's and family's request. After one year, 86% or six of the German-Americans and 80% or four of the Greek-Americans remained out of the hospital. In year two, 34% or two of the German-Americans and 60% or three of the Greek-Americans remained out of the hospital. Of those hospitalized 50% were noncompliant in taking their medication. Rehospitalization was avoided in 33% or four of the patients who started to relapse because of prompt intervention by the study team. Alcohol and drug abuse was reported in 71% or five of the German-American patients, but none of the Greek-American patients reported alcohol or drug abuse. This was probably a factor in the higher hospitalization rate for the German-American patients. A criminal history was reported in 28% or two of the German-American patients but in none of the Greek-American patients.  All treatment took place in the patient's home. The principal investigator, a nurse anthropologist, was the family therapist. The psychiatrist evaluated the patients and prescribed medication. The patients and families developed more effective problem solving abilities, better communication skills, and learned about the latest advances in the treatment and etiology of mental illness. This was a factor in reducing the patient's and family's stress level. Specific family therapy treatment approaches were developed to be used with the German-American families versus the Greek-American families.

THE WONDER OF MEANING: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL DISTRESS (COPING),Carol Jean Smucker,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278951W,/authors/OL5368286A/Carol_Jean_Smucker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 197,"The purpose of this study was to describe the phenomenon of spiritual distress as it is experienced by adults in the general population. The study focused on the key aspect of spiritual distress--concern about the meaning of life, death, and/or beliefs. Using phenomenological interview procedures, ten participants were asked to describe experiences of being concerned about the meaning of life, death, and/or their beliefs. All participants considered their beliefs to be very important, evaluated their health as good, and named a religious affiliation with which they are identified.  A hermeneutical approach was used for data analysis. Data were analyzed within the dialogic process of a phenomenological research group in addition to the researcher's individual work. The thematic structure derived from the data describes the experiential themes of spiritual distress and their inter-relationships.  Participant narratives were grounded in the context of time. The thematic structure of the experience of spiritual distress was biphasic. The metaphor of the Web of Life, taken from the words of one participant, was used to describe both phases. Phase one was termed Breaking the Web, and occurred when an event broke the continuity of life. The three major themes and subthemes of this phase were: (1) Falling Apart (Pain, Instability), (2) Wondering (Questioning), and (3) Something Beyond (Feeling, Presence, Mystery). The second phase, during which participants found meaning in their experiences, was termed Rebuilding the Web. The four major themes and subthemes of this phase were: (1) Stability (Strength, Security), (2) Change and Growth (Self, Beliefs), (3) Wondering (No Answers, Accepting Limits to Knowing), and (4) Something Beyond.  Findings were discussed in relation to nursing practice, education, and research. Implications of this research for the nursing diagnosis Spiritual Distress were addressed and suggestions were made for future research on spiritual distress.

"PERCEPTUAL REACTANCE, DRUG OF CHOICE AND PAIN PERCEPTION IN SUBSTANCE ABUSERS (DRUG ABUSE)",Margaret Ann Compton,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278463W,/authors/OL5367865A/Margaret_Ann_Compton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 161,"Managing complaints of pain in the hospitalized substance abuser poses a challenging nursing care problem. The objective of this research was to develop a better understanding of the experience of pain for drug abusers. Specifically, it was posited that their pain experience is related to their perceptual style which is also expected to be manifest in their preferred drug of use. Petrie's (1967) theory of perceptual reactance predicts that persons who characteristically augment or magnify sensory experience are relatively pain intolerant and prefer drugs which restrict sensory experience, whereas persons who perceptually reduce or attenuate the same are more pain tolerant and prefer the subjective effects of sensory-expanding drugs. Utilizing a descriptive survey design, the relationships among perceptual reactance, drug of choice and pain perception were explored. Perceptual reactance in a convenience volunteer sample of 122 treatment-seeking male substance abusers was described using Vando's (1974) Reducing-Augmenting Scale and non-specific skin conductance response frequency. Drug of choice was dichotomized as either a sensory-expanding or restricting drug and operationalized as response to a single open-ended question assessing drug preference. Pain perception was measured as tolerance in seconds to a single cold pressor trial. Descriptive analyses revealed that over one-third the sample evidenced electrodermal non-responsivity, and a high rate of cold-pressor pain intolerance. Reducing-Augmenting Scale score correlated to drug of choice for the electrodermally responsive subsample only and not at all to pain perception. The electrodermal measure of perceptual reactance did not correlate to drug of choice or pain perception. Drug of choice related to the subject's history of anxiety and drug treatment, and both pain perception and drug of choice were associated with whether or not the subject was currently drug-using.

"BODY IMAGE DISSATISFACTION, SELF-ESTEEM, AND SEX-ROLE IDENTITY IN MIDLIFE WOMEN",Nicki Lee Warren Potts,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278986W,/authors/OL5368316A/Nicki_Lee_Warren_Potts,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 180,"Many women in Western society are dissatisfied with their body image and feel pressured to conform to a culturally prescribed standard which is difficult to attain. Although numerous studies have examined body image concerns in adolescents and young adult females, data about women in midlife is sparse. The purpose of this descriptive, correlational study was to examine the relationships among body image dissatisfaction, self-esteem, sex-role identity, body mass index, and body size discrepancy in midlife women.  The nonprobability sample consisted of 170 predominantly Caucasian (91%) women between the ages of 35 and 50, with a mean age of 41. The majority were married (69%), had a college or graduate degree (82%), and had a mean annual income of $40,000 to $60,000. Study instruments were: the Body Shape Questionnaire, measuring body image dissatisfaction, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Bem Sex-Role Inventory which determined the sex-role category of each subject. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 24.5 which is at the upper end of the desirable weight range.  The level of body image dissatisfaction was high, with most (87%) women wanting to be thinner, although only 35% were actually overweight. Body size discrepancy, self-esteem, and body mass index accounted for 41% of the variance in body image dissatisfaction. Mother's weight as an adult, body shape (apple vs. pear), and income accounted for an additional 19% of the variance in body image dissatisfaction. Sex-role identity did not predict body image dissatisfaction, nor were there significant differences in body image dissatisfaction for sex-role identity groups. The level of body image dissatisfaction differed significantly according to body mass index group. The underweight group (BMI $<$ 20) had the lowest level of dissatisfaction, and the obese group (BMI = 30-39.9) had the highest level of dissatisfaction. Women with a pear shape (a lower body distribution of fat) had a higher level of body image dissatisfaction than women with an apple shape (an abdominal distribution of fat).  This study indicates that many women in midlife have incorporated society's image of the ideal female body, and not measuring up to that ideal, they are dissatisfied. This dissatisfaction is primarily demonstrated as a desire to be thinner. Data also suggest that although the typical female distribution of body fat is protective for cardiovascular disease, women are dissatisfied with this pear shape.

MATERNAL PARENTAL SUPPORT AND STRESS RESPONSE IN SEXUALLY ABUSED GIRLS AGES 6-12,Delia Virginia Esparza,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267289W,/authors/OL5359192A/Delia_Virginia_Esparza,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 235,"The purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to examine the relationships between maternal parental support and stress response in girls, ages 6-12, sexually abused by someone other than a parent and who does not live in the household in which the girl resides. Study participants included 20 mother-daughter pairs in which the daughter had been sexually abused, and 50 mother-daughter pairs in which the daughter was not known to have been sexually abused. Both groups were convenience samples.  Ellison's (1983; 1985) Family Peer Relationship Questionnaire (FPRQ), a parental support scale, was used to assess maternal parental support as perceived by the mother participants and as perceived by the daughter participants, while the daughter's stress response (as perceived by the mothers) was measured by Chandler's (1986) Stress Response Scale.  When the variables which significantly differentiated between the two groups (abuse, non-abuse) were held constant, the relationship between maternal parental support (both as perceived by the mothers, and as perceived by the daughters) and stress response (as perceived by the mothers) were significant in the abuse group and were not significant in the non-abuse group. No significant differences were found in the levels of maternal parental support and stress response between the two groups when controlling for other stressful life events. However, the abuse group had significantly higher levels of stress response overall and had significantly more (one and a half times as many) stressful life events than the non abuse group.  These results support the existing literature that sexual abuse of a girl is a significant disrupter in her life. Further, these results suggest that, while maternal parental support may be important on a day to day basis, it is even more important to the girl's coping process following a traumatic incident such as sexual abuse.  As a result of this study, nurses have more evidence to support their efforts to help mothers of sexually abused girls cope with this stressor in order to facilitate both the mother's and the girl's coping processes. Nursing education has additional evidence to support the importance of teaching nursing students how to support parents, specifically mothers, to support their stressed daughters.

THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC AND RELAXATION ON THIRD TRIMESTER ANXIETY IN ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY (PREGNANCY),Sammi Siegel Liebman,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266688W,/authors/OL5358698A/Sammi_Siegel_Liebman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 153,"The literature suggests that anxiety impacts on pregnancy outcome. Two different types of anxiety have been identified. A distinction is made between transitory emotional reactions to situational stress (state anxiety) and degree of anxiety-proneness inherent in personality (trait anxiety). Consistently higher state anxiety levels during pregnancy were found to be associated with the development of obstetric complications. There is agreement in the literature that music interventions impact greater on state anxiety than trait anxiety.  Adolescence is a uniquely stressful period. The pregnant adolescent is often considered a ""high-risk"" patient because she is predisposed to (a) pre-eclampsia, (b) higher maternal and infant mortality rates, (c) anemia, (d) low birthweight babies, (e) sizing and dating problems, and (f) multiple socioeconomic complications.  Music therapy protocols have been successfully implemented in childbirth education classes. The success of these programs is based largely on the patients' commitment to home practice of relaxation techniques. It is argued that teenagers can enhance pregnancy outcomes when they are taught relaxation techniques and can apply these techniques to their physical and mental well-being during pregnancy.  This study compared state and trait anxiety scores within the third trimester of pregnancy between a group of adolescent girls receiving music therapy treatment and a group of girls not receiving music therapy treatment. Twenty students served as the control group and 19 students served as the experimental group.  All subjects in the study were administered the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory at the beginning of the seventh, eighth, and ninth months of pregnancy. The State Anxiety Inventory was administered weekly to all subjects for a total of ten weeks beginning at the seventh month of pregnancy.  A 2 x 3 repeated-measures ANOVA was performed on the trait anxiety data. A statistically significant main effect difference was revealed between the groups. However, there was no significant change over time in the anxiety level of the two groups nor was there any significant interaction between the groups.  A 2 x 10 repeated-measures ANOVA was performed on the state anxiety data. A statistically significant main effect difference was revealed between the groups as well as a statistically significant interaction between group and week. Overall, the experimental subjects showed less state anxiety than did the control subjects.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"THE RELATIONSHIP OF BEREAVED PARENTAL DISTRESS, COPING, FAMILY FUNCTIONING, COHESIVENESS AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT WITH INFANT DEATH",Ruth Marie Carroll,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266800W,/authors/OL5358786A/Ruth_Marie_Carroll,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 137,"Research findings have consistently supported the existence of a differential grief response between bereaved spouses after the death of an infant and have suggested the death has a negative effect on family relationships. However, most research on parental responses to infant death has focused on the mother, and neglects relationships among other family members. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between bereaved parents' individual distress and perceptions of relationships such as coping patterns, spouse support, family functioning and cohesiveness. The ecosystem model of grief and mourning developed from an ecosystem perspective (Melson, 1980) was used as the conceptual framework for this study, permitting explorations of associations between individual, family and sociocultural responses to infant death.  A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to study sixty volunteer families from two Mid-Atlantic states who experienced the death of an infant three months to three years prior to the interview. Data were collected in the family's home using self-report measures independently administered to both bereaved parents. Data were analyzed using SPSS-X and a variety of descriptive and multivariate correlational procedures.  Five coping patterns used by parents (seeking support, accepting support, activity, self reliance, and intra-family communication and support), the bereaved parent's gender, and the time elapsed since the death of the infant were entered into a stepwise multiple regression to explore their association with the bereaved parent's perception of achieved versus expected family functioning. Self reliance and accepting support were the best predictors of family functioning. There was no significant difference between mothers' and fathers' perceptions of family functioning. There was a significant positive association between the bereaved parent's perception of spouse support since the death of the infant and their current distress. Individuals who withheld their expression of grief were more likely to perceive their family as less cohesive. The prediction that there would be a positive association between the use of mourning rites and perception of family cohesiveness was not tested since all but one of the families had a funeral or memorial service at the time of the death.

"ADJUSTMENT OF CHILDREN WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS: CHILD, PARENT, AND TEACHER PERSPECTIVES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHILD",Catherine Marie Cook Ayoub,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267611W,/authors/OL5359472A/Catherine_Marie_Cook_Ayoub,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 106,"The larger study of which this research is a part identifies some of the characteristics that are related to the development of children's resilience in the face of a chronic illness. Its broad aims are to contribute to a conceptual framework on vulnerability, coping, and adaptation in children with chronic illness that can be used by health care providers and educators as the basis for their clinical interventions, educational programs, and policy decisions.  The unique contribution of this research is its focus on the characteristics that children bring to bear on their psychosocial adjustment, and how these characteristics interact with the children's health status to determine psychosocial risk and resilience. This study examines the importance of the child attributes of age, verbal intelligence, cognitive understanding, temperament, health locus of control, and social networks in the prediction of psychosocial adjustment among healthy children, children with a seizure disorder, and children with orthopedic conditions. In addition, the study investigates how the psychosocial adjustment of chronically-ill and healthy children differs according to the perception of three observers, the child, the parent, and the teacher.  A combined measure of temperament as well as the special contribution of the parent's view of the child's temperament was important in the prediction of child adjustment from the perspective of all of the observers. From the adult perspective (parent and teacher), gender and the interaction between temperament and verbal intelligence were important in predicting the child's adjustment. Verbal intelligence was particularly prominent from the teacher's point of view, reflecting differences in setting and the observer's orientation to the child.  There was a trend indicating that healthy children were better adjusted than their peers with chronic illnesses; this trend was emphasized by parents, but was seemingly unimportant to teachers. From the child's point of view only, age and health locus of control beliefs contributed to the prediction of child adjustment.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE INDEX OF RECIDIVISM IN THE CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL (MENTALLY ILL),Leona Jean Dorcheus,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267640W,/authors/OL5359500A/Leona_Jean_Dorcheus,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 150,"The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Index of Recidivism in the Chronically Mentally Ill. The instrument was previously tested for a Master's thesis. The revisions from that study were then further tested for this study.  The validity of the variables not found acceptable in the previous study was assessed by two expert judges using a modified Q-sort for the revised variables. All variables were found to be acceptable for importance to the chronically mentally ill (content validity), accuracy of definition, and placement within the theoretical model (congruency of epistemic assumptions or construct validity). Content validity of the instrument variables was evaluated comparing the data gathered by the expert judge and by the data gatherer for a generalizability coefficient of.82.  The instrument was tested with a sample of 50 client records using a data gatherer and the primary researcher. The interrater reliability and intrarater reliability generalizability coefficients were.87 and.88 respectively. Further research to establish indices of recidivism using the IRCMI is indicated.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-CONCEPT DURING THE THREE TRIMESTERS OF PREGNANCY,Sharon Lynn Hall,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268125W,/authors/OL5359916A/Sharon_Lynn_Hall,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 270,"The purpose of this study was to examine self concept changes over the three trimesters of pregnancy in primiparas. A descriptive longitudinal study with a final sample of 32 primiparas was completed. The participants were healthy adult married primiparas who met specific demographic criteria. Each participant completed the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) and the Lederman Prenatal Self-Evaluation Questionnaire 11 toward the end of each trimester. Semi-structured interviews with twelve volunteers were conducted late in the third trimester, upon completion of all data. Data were analyzed through repeated measures ANOVAs (instruments) and inductive analysis (interviews).  There was no change in general self-concept. However, there were statistically significant changes in one or more subscales of both instruments. Quantitative analysis of the TSCS indicated significant change (p $<$.05) in one subscale, Social Self, while analysis of the Lederman Questionnaire indicated change (p $<$.05) in four subscales: Acceptance of Pregnancy, Identification of the Motherhood Role, Fear of Pain and Loss of Control, and Preparation for Labor. Data obtained from the interviews partially corroborated the findings in the instruments. The predominant discrepancy between the instruments and the interviews appeared to be the many physical changes noted by the informants but not statistically indicated on the TSCS.  Most informants indicated that pregnancy was an exciting time, adding new dimensions to their lives, but it did not change how they thought about themselves. Many women described changes in their body but viewed them as an expected part of pregnancy. They indicated closer relationships with their husbands and parents. Many informants expressed ambivalence about pregnancy but appeared to have come to terms with the idea of the pregnancy. The developmental process of identification with the motherhood role was ongoing during the pregnancy, but many women did not yet perceive the reality of the baby. Behavior changes were anticipated in labor because of fear of pain, but the informants accepted the fact that labor had a finite length and they would be rewarded at its conclusion with a baby. Most informants expressed changes in their personal behavior and perspectives but these were not as perceived significant changes.

"THE EFFECTS OF POSITIVE MENTAL IMAGERY ON HOPE, COPING, ANXIETY, DYSPNEA AND PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PERSONS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: TESTS OF A NURSING INTERVENTION AND A THEORETICAL MODEL",Betty Lou Aubuchon,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267777W,/authors/OL5359622A/Betty_Lou_Aubuchon,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 289,"The twofold purpose of this study was to determine the effects of imagery on hope, coping, anxiety, dyspnea and pulmonary function in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to test a theoretical model explaining the effects of imagery.  The study used a pretest, posttest, control group design. Eighty-three nonhospitalized subjects with COPD were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or to a control group. One treatment group used a tape emphasizing positive possible selves. The second treatment group used a tape emphasizing relaxation. The control group did not use a tape. State anxiety was measured with Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Scale, hope with the Nowatny Hope Scale (NHS) and the Beck Hopelessness Inventory (BHI) and coping with the Jalowiec Coping Scale. Dyspnea was determined utilizing a visual analog scale. Pulmonary function was measured with the Mini-Wright Peak-Flow Meter.  Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and stepwise multiple regression. ANCOVA using the pretest scores as a covariate identified a number of factors. Hope was altered by the treatments (BHI: F = 3.158; p =.064) (NHS: F = 5.1; p =.027) while anxiety was not (F = 1.3; p =.264). The use of emotion-focused coping was less in the treatment subjects (F = 2.9; p =.091) while the use of problem-focused coping was greater in the relaxation subjects (F = 2.4; p =.12). Subjects using possible selves imagery had less dyspnea than those using relaxation imagery (F = 3.5; p =.06). Finally, subjects using possible selves imagery had greater respiratory function than those using relaxation imagery (F = 2.4; p =.1).  Five stepwise multiple regressions were performed. With possible selves imagery, 18% of the variance in dyspnea is predicted by anxiety (p =.025) while 27% of the variance in anxiety is predicted by hopelessness (p =.005). Again with possible selves imagery, hope (p =.0023) and coping (p =.0016) predict 48% of the variance in respiratory function.  With relaxation imagery, 14% of the variance in respiratory function is predicted by problem-focused coping (p =.06) while 59% of the variance in problem-focused coping is accounted for by hope (p =.09) and emotion-focused coping (p =.0000).  It is recommended that imagery is an effective intervention for COPD patients. Further research on both the effects and the theoretical explanations is needed.

"AGE, TRUST, LIFE EVENTS, BOUNDARIES, AND SOCIAL SKILLS: A PATH ANALYSIS (PERSONAL BOUNDARIES)",Anne Latham Scott,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267737W,/authors/OL5359585A/Anne_Latham_Scott,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 235,"The problem examined in this study was how much variance is explained in a model of boundaries (flexible, open, and closed), including three antecedents, age, life events, and trust, and one consequence, social skills. The purpose was to test six hypotheses purporting the relationship and predictive power of the variables in the recursive model. This exploratory descriptive study used a path analysis design with a survey technique to test a theoretical model designed by the researcher. The non-random convenience sample of 145 adults 18 to 77 was demographically diverse. The four instruments used in data collection were the General Opinion Survey, the Schedule of Recent Experience, the Social Skills Inventory, and the Scott Boundary Measurement Tool for Adults. The reliability of all instruments was greater than.70.  Data was analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. An alpha of.10 was used as the criteria for retaining beta weights. In the final model, 17.4% (p =.0000) of the variance of social skills was explained by age and open boundaries. Of this, 4.18% was explained by age and 13.27% was explained by open boundaries. Trust explained 1.96% (p =.093) of the variance of open boundaries and 2.14% ($p$ =.079) of the variance of closed boundaries. Age and life events were correlated at $-$.478 (p $<$.001). Flexible boundaries had a curvilinear relationship with social skills and did not have a significant relationship with any of the variables in the model.  Of the six hypotheses, two were partially supported and four were rejected. This study implied that nurses should avoid generalizing older people as less trusting, less flexible, or less open. The study reinforced that trust is a prerequisite for open relationships and open boundaries are a prerequisite for social skills. Because life events were not predictive of boundaries, it can be concluded that it is not the number of life events but rather the meaning of the events that cause people to respond either with openness, closedness, or flexibility. Although the social skills of the older client may be poorer, the elderly person is not intentionally closing their boundaries. Neither trust nor life events were predictive of good social skills.

COPING STRATEGIES AND WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT DURING THE AGE-30 TRANSITION (TRANSITIONS),Lou Futrell Gramling,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268119W,/authors/OL5359911A/Lou_Futrell_Gramling,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 117,"Existing models of adult development are derived primarily from observations of men and are not supported when observations are made of women. Empirical evidence concerning women's coping strategies is inconclusive. A qualitative research design is ideally suited to studying development and coping strategies as described by women in the context of their lives. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe coping strategies and transitions in women's development. The Age-30 Transition was selected to focus the study on one developmental period as there is preliminary evidence that this period is a critical time in women's lives.  This field research used the ethnographic interview and analysis techniques to explore the life transitions of women between the ages of 25 and 35 years. A combination of network and nominated sampling techniques were used. Data collection included a minimum of three tape-recorded interviews with 10 good informants. The ethnographic techniques of structured and unstructured interviews were used to elicit thick descriptions of women's coping and development during the Age-30 Transition. Data analysis was concurrent with data collection so that the researcher's interpretations could be validated by the informants.  The significant themes of women's development during this age period were: (a) on-going separation from family, (b) relationships with men, (c) having or not having children, (d) work issues, (e) sadness, and (f) developing a life philosophy. Women reported a developmental change around the Age-30 Transition. They described differences in perception and meaning after Age-30, although the majority of the significant themes of the twenties continued into the thirties.  Women described a variety of coping strategies that can be categorized as permissive avoidance, confrontation, diversion, and philosophical. Changes in coping related to appraisal and the use of coping strategies were detected after the Age-30 Transition, although the women did not describe specific changes in types of coping strategies.

GAMAN AS A PRESCHOOLERS' METHOD OF COPING DURING HOSPITALIZATION (JAPAN),Noriko Katada,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267864W,/authors/OL5359700A/Noriko_Katada,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 171,"The purpose of this study was to describe the gaman phenomena for hospitalized preschoolers in Japan. Gaman is a common word used in Japanese to describe a person's state when an effort is made to maintain personal integrity and social harmony. The Western concept of coping as explored by Lazarus and Folkman was used as the theoretical framework. The conceptual construct of gaman was constructed from the awareness component which includes cognitive appraisal and the performance component which includes behavioral responses of children to the situational demand.  A descriptive, non-experimental design was used in this exploratory study. Behavioral observation of 29 hospitalized preschoolers, aged 3 to 5, was conducted in two inpatient units of a children's hospital located in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Observation was scheduled at the following four points: (1) around admission, (2) during the preoperative and postoperative period, (3) during the morning routine, and (4) during visiting hours.  Observed behaviors were categorized into nine identifiable behavioral patterns related to gaman: (1) strong gaman, (2) moderate gaman, (3) strong gaman with struggle of amae, (4) moderate gaman with struggle of amae, (5) overwhelming gaman, (6) out of control, (7) latent gaman, (8) wagamama, and (9) not appropriate. The findings were analyzed and frequency counted. The results of these categories of behavior indicated that (1) manifestation of gaman behavior has patterns that could be determined by the self-control ability of the child, by the child's evaluation of the environment, and by the intensity of demand in a situation; (2) gaman manifestation is not directly related to incidents occurring immediately before such a manifestation and has a rather complex, accumulated effect based upon the children's interpretation of the situation; (3) there were no differences in gaman patterns by age, sex, birth order, preparation for hospitalization, or past experience in the nursery; and (4) the ability to do gaman developed with ego organization. In conclusion, gaman involves emotional commitment as well as active coping strategies. The results of this study can be generalized to Japanese preschoolers hospitalized in conditions similar to this study.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"BURNOUT, BEREAVEMENT, AND WAYS OF COPING IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND VOLUNTEERS WHO WORK WITH CLIENTS WHO HAVE HIV/AIDS (IMMUNE DEFICIENCY)",Michelle Frances Hamilton,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279697W,/authors/OL5368948A/Michelle_Frances_Hamilton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 130,"This research was designed to evaluate the relationship between ""burnout"", which is an emotional and physical phenomenon resulting from conditions at work, subjective distress that is related to multiple bereavement, and ways of coping in caregivers of clients with HIV/AIDS. Caregivers from an HIV outpatient program, two hospice programs, and an AIDS task force completed questionnaires which assessed: (a) the level of experienced burnout, (b) subjective distress that is related to multiple bereavement, (c) ways of coping with stress, and (d) various professional and demographic variables. Emotional exhaustion, which is a component of burnout, subjective distress that is related to multiple bereavement, and escape-avoidance and self-controlling coping strategies, were significantly associated with each other. These respondents did not experience burnout at a higher level than the average range for medical or mental health personnel. Paid employees had higher levels of emotional exhaustion at work than did volunteers. All caregivers had high rates of personal accomplishment. Hospice workers had the same amount of subjective distress that was related to multiple bereavement as did other caregivers. Not having had work-related support needs that were met by one's supervisor, fear of contagion of TB and other infectious diseases excluding HIV, number of hours that were spent per week in direct contact with clients, and knowing co-workers who were infected and/or had died of HIV/AIDS, were predictive of burnout.

EMPATHY LEVELS AND COPING PROFILES OF A SELECTED GROUP OF PSYCHIATRIC REGISTERED NURSES,Lula Westrup Pelayo,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279688W,/authors/OL5368940A/Lula_Westrup_Pelayo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 294,"The purposes of this study were to obtain information on empathy levels and to determine the relationships between coping methods and selected demographic variables with empathy levels in a sample of psychiatric registered nurses employed in selected mental health care settings. This study was initiated to add to the current theory base of empathy and coping in nursing. Overall goals included applying the essential elements of the works of Rogers and Lazarus as operationalized respectively by La Monica and Jalowiec to this study and to report normative data on psychiatric registered nurse empathy levels.  There were 172 female and 33 male psychiatric registered nurses, aged 20 to 71 or more years, in the convenience sample. Data were obtained by the use of the Empathy Construct Rating Scale (La Monica, 1984), the Jalowiec Coping Scale (Jalowiec, 1987), and a demographic data sheet. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive analysis techniques, Pearson product-moment correlation, and stepwise multiple regression. Two methods were used to calculate empathy scores in order to compare findings with previous studies. They were identified as Empathy 1 scores and Empathy 2 scores.  Findings demonstrated moderately well-developed empathy levels in the psychiatric registered nurse. Results of the analysis showed low positive significant relationships between Empathy 1 scores and confrontive coping methods (p =.0001) and between Empathy 1 scores and optimistic coping methods (p =.0429) and a low inverse significant relationship between Empathy 1 scores and emotive coping methods (p =.0440). Findings also revealed low positive significant relationships between Empathy 2 scores and confrontive coping methods (p =.0000) and between Empathy 2 scores and optimistic coping methods (p =.0250).  Among the coping method and demographic predictor variables, confrontive coping methods, highest educational preparation, working with patients having psychosexual disorders, and type of employee accounted for 16% of the variance in Empathy 1 scores (p =.0000). Confrontive coping methods, highest educational preparation, working with patients having psychosexual disorders, working with patients having psychological factors affecting physical condition disorders, and emotive coping methods accounted for 19% of the variance in Empathy 2 scores (p =.0000). Implications for nursing theory development, practice, education, and research were identified.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
SELF-REFLECTIVE GUIDED IMAGERY AMONG MIDDLE AGED OBESE WOMEN IN A SUPPORT GROUP SETTING,Janice Clara Surina Cise,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279874W,/authors/OL5369104A/Janice_Clara_Surina_Cise,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 213,"Obesity is a major problem in the United States, especially for individuals at the extreme end of the weight scale. It has medical, social, and emotional consequences. Traditional treatments often consist of singular approaches that do not take into account the complex factors that contribute to the obese condition. The high relapse rate is associated with the lack of holistic approach to treatment.  The concepts of unitary human being, holism, and self care provide a uniquely nursing philosophical orientation that fits well with the theoretical framework of Lazarus' Theory of Emotion and neurochemical physiology, and supports the imagery intervention. This study sought to describe and interpret the issues of concern that emerged among women who took part in an eight week program of Self Reflective Guided Imagery, and the process of transformation that occurred during this intervention.  The participants were middle aged women who weighed more that 40% above ideal. Naturalistic methods included tape recorded weekly group sessions, a journal, and drawing. The researcher designed the imagery program, guided each session and facilitated the group discussion.  The issues of concern for the women who completed the program were captured in a story that sought to describe each woman's concerns from her own perspective. As a whole the group discussed a variety of emotions: anger, sadness, depression, frustration, resentment, shame, guilt and grief. Fat was generally thought of as protection and was symbolized as padding or blanket to hide themselves. Hiding was a way of ""dealing with"" the troublesome emotions. The two themes, emotion and hiding, were interpreted using theories of emotion, psychoneurophysiology, and the veiling customs of the women of Arabia and Islam. The term Veil of Obesity was coined to describe the latter interpretation. A process of transformation was described as a four phase process that involved work: Intellectual awareness, Getting below the surface, Making sense of it all, and Transcendence.  The findings in this research support the link between emotions and obesity. Food and hiding strategies are a means of coping with troublesome emotions. Obesity, then is the manifestation of inadequate coping strategies, rather than disease. The program of Self Reflective Guided Imagery, used in this study, is seen as a readiness intervention, before weight loss is attempted, to increase a woman's awareness and learn more effective strategies for coping with troublesome emotions.

THE MEANING OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND ITS CONNECTION WITH THE INNER SPIRIT AS PERCEIVED BY CAREGIVERS OF THE COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED,Earline Westphal Miller,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279360W,/authors/OL5368629A/Earline_Westphal_Miller,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 183,"The purpose of this naturalistic descriptive study was to explore the meaning of encouragement and its connection with the inner spirit as perceived by caregivers of cognitively impaired individuals. This study further explored what aspects of a specified nursing intervention these caregivers described as encouraging. The specified nursing intervention was part of a larger intervention study that examined the effects of Modeling and Role-Modeling interventions on persons with Alzheimer's type dementia and their caregivers.  The eudaemonistic model of health is reflected in the current movement of the nursing profession as it shifts from a more clinical model to a model which includes well-being. In this study I focused on the eudaemonistic model of health. Little has been done to conceptualize the essence of encouragement, the connection with the inner spirit, or the process of encouraging.  The Modeling and Role-Modeling theory provided the sensitizing framework (Erickson, Tomlin, and Swain, 1983). Methodology for data collection and data analysis followed the guidelines for Interpretive Interactionism outlined by Denzin (1989). A purposive sample of 14 subjects was selected from caregivers of cognitively impaired individuals who were participating in the larger intervention study. Data were collected through open-ended interviewing. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method, as well as the methods of capturing, bracketing, constructing, and contextualizing.  The selected caregivers described the meaning of encouragement as dynamic, interacting, and involving processes of acceptance, as individuals move from hurting to healing through trust in others, belief in self-worth, and faith in a higher power. An encouragement model emerged that validated connection with the inner spirit, connection with one's own worth, and connection with each other. All aspects of the nursing intervention were viewed as encouraging.  A metaphor of a tree depicted the private lives of the caregivers as they were experiencing loss and grief, carrying the whole load, letting go, and healing. In addition to private concerns, they shared their perceptions of public response to their caregiving needs.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES AMONG FIRST-EPISODE AND RECURRENTLY DEPRESSED WOMEN DURING DEPRESSION AND RECOVERY,Margaret Marie Calarco,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273904W,/authors/OL5364315A/Margaret_Marie_Calarco,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 199,"Depression remains one of the most common mental health problems in the United States. Although the social, psychological, and physiological impact of recurrent depressive episodes have not been systematically studied, accumulating clinical evidence suggests that there is indeed a toll paid for experiencing recurrent depression.  The purpose of this study was to describe the psychological and neuroendocrine differences between women who had experienced only one episode of Major Depressive Disorder (FE) with women who had experienced recurrent depressive episodes (RD). Thirty-two depressed female clients from a large university medical center's outpatient clinic for depression were placed into first-episode (n = 14) and recurrent groups (n = 18), and were compared to a community sample of age-matched, female control subjects (n = 20).  A battery of psychological instruments used to measure perceptions of control and helplessness, emotional responsiveness, interpersonal dependency, and self-appraisal and coping responses were administered while subjects were in an episode of depression, and again, when subjects were euthymic for at least a four week period (controls were measured at two time points, 8 to 12 weeks apart). Urinary-free cortisol measures for all groups were also completed at the same time points.  Analyses using ANOVAs and paired t-tests have revealed significant differences in emotional responsiveness between first-episode and recurrently depressed groups during the episode of depression, and more importantly, after the depressive episode has resolved. Recovered, recurrently depressed women also endorsed a significantly greater number of items related to feeling a loss of control. Coping responses for the total depressed group were also significantly different than controls after recovery. Differences in urinary-free cortisol were not demonstrated.  These findings suggest that experiencing recurrent episodes of depression may indeed have psychological consequences which may impact one's response to subsequent stressors. The development of a psychological ""sensitivity"" to depression is hypothesized.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
STRESS AND SELF-ESTEEM IN PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER,Marina Fowler Slemmons,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12274070W,/authors/OL5364443A/Marina_Fowler_Slemmons,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 228,"Using a methodological design and confirmatory factor analysis, the fit of theoretically derived models of parenting stress, coping and self-esteem in 303 parents of children with ADHD were examined. Parenting stress was measured using selected subscales of the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). Coping was measured using the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC). Parent self-esteem was measured by the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC).  Prior to completing the confirmatory analysis, internal consistency and exploratory findings were examined. The proposed three factor model for parenting stress was not identified and could not be estimated. A two factor model and a unidimensional model suggested by exploratory factor analysis were specified and resulted in models with improper estimates. Exploratory factor analysis of the PSI items revealed that the items did not load on the appropriate subscales. Without a stable factor structure at the item level, use of scale scores in the confirmatory model could not be justified.  A unidimensional model of coping was proposed. Exploratory factor analysis of the WOC using the scale scores suggested a three factor model. Both models were estimated and were found to have poor fit statistics. Again, exploratory factor analysis did not support the factor structure reported by the author of the WOC.  The proposed unidimensional model of parenting self-esteem did not meet the criteria for identification of models. Instead, the model was respecified with 16 observed indicators loading on two latent variables. The instrument was revised based on item analysis. This resulted in a 13-item instrument with an alpha of.8411. Exploratory analysis revealed two factors with items loading on the appropriate subscales. Three models were estimated in the confirmatory analysis using 16, 13, and 11 items. The 11-item model showed the best fit with the data having a nonsignificant chi-square and acceptable goodness of fit indices. However, two of the parameters showed improper estimates and further refinement of the model was not pursued.  Unfortunately, no models were found for any of the constructs which fit the data from these parents and group differences could not be addressed.

THE EXPERIENCE OF GETTING WELL AS PERCEIVED BY ADOLESCENTS RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,Karen Dewitt,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268477W,/authors/OL5360187A/Karen_Dewitt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 122,"The experience of getting well as perceived by adolescents recovering from trauma was studied utilizing a phenomenological perspective. This descriptive study utilized the philosophical work of Merleau-Ponty (1962) and the phenomenological method of Van Manen (1984). Little was known about what it is like to get well in the midst of the physiological and psychological changes of adolescence. Twelve adolescents were interviewed twice prior to their discharge from a pediatric rehabilitation hospital. These adolescents were asked to describe their experience of getting well.  Eleven themes were identified in the data, (1) The love my family gave to me, (2) I didn't know if I would ever be well, (3) Getting well is a scary experience, (4) You got to have willpower, (5) Getting well takes a long time, (6) Treat me like a normal person, (7) A time to think about how I have changed, (8) I want to do things for myself, (9) A special person was there for me, (10) Feelings of being like garbage, and (11) Not my time to die.  The eleven themes identified all had implications for the care of the adolescent client and family. Peer interaction was discussed as a treatment modality. Implications of these findings for nursing research, education, clinical practice and administration were discussed. It was evident that nurses needed to increase their understanding of the adolescent experience of getting well in order to meet the fundamental needs of this client population.

"UNCERTAINTY, SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT TO CHRONIC ILLNESS",Billye Jo Pettis Landis,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268553W,/authors/OL5360256A/Billye_Jo_Pettis_Landis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 123,"Chronic illness is a major health problem in the United States with approximately 110 million Americans afflicted with some type of long-term health problem. Uncertainty is considered a major factor affecting adjustment to illness but little work has been directed at understanding its long-term effects in chronic illness. Although alleged to be a powerful coping resource, spiritual well-being has not been explored sufficiently and its effects on adjustment and the uncertainty of chronic illness is not known. Therefore the guiding question for this research was: What are the relationships among uncertainty, spiritual well-being, and psychosocial adjustment in adults with a chronic illness?.  A descriptive correlational design was used to answer three research questions and to test three hypotheses. The over-all theoretical framework for this study was Modeling and Role-Modeling. The sample of convenience consisted of 94 community-based adults with diabetes mellitus type I or II. The sample was drawn from Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Five instruments were used for data collection; the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale-Community Form, the Spiritual Well-Being Scale, the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self Report, a Participant Survey, and an Interview Schedule.  Data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational, multivariate, and content analysis procedures. The sample of diabetics had a moderately low level of uncertainty, a high level of spiritual well-being, and were relatively well adjusted to living with diabetes. Pearson r correlations revealed significant inverse relationships between uncertainty and spiritual well-being and between spiritual well-being and psychosocial adjustment problems. Hierarchial multiple regression indicated that uncertainty accounted for 43% of the variance in over-all adjustment. Spiritual well-being had a significant 10% mediating effect on adjustment problems and uncertainty related to diabetes. Uncertainty and spiritual well-being together accounted for 56% of the variance in psychological distress and spiritual well-being explained a notable 21% of that relative variance.  An unexpected finding in the study was the positive relationship between religious well-being and psychosocial adjustment problems to diabetes and its uncertainties. Existential orientation was consistently the major contributor of spiritual well-being.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
WHO CARES? SOCIAL SUPPORT AND WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER,Patricia Anne Bredenberg,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268628W,/authors/OL5360325A/Patricia_Anne_Bredenberg,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 445,"Social support is a powerful coping resource for those stressed by crisis or severe illness. The foundation of policy measures designed to reintegrate mentally disadvantaged into the community, it is the basis for self-help groups designed to aid those dealing with a variety of social and human ills. Ironically, social support is a concept that, intuitively understood, avoids precise definition, measurement, and operationalization. Little is known about how or when social support is most effective, how mobilized, or what impedes or enhances its effects.  This qualitative research was designed to uncover the natural support behaviors of social network members of women severely stressed by breast cancer. Feminist methodology, informed by a feminist philosophy and perspective, provided the framework and guided all research aspects. The purpose was to determine: how women defined and mobilized social support, what types of support they found effective at what specific intervals, what forms of support they believed enhanced or impaired their ability to cope with threats they faced.  The research is based on initial interviews with 121 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Intensive interviews with twenty women and a person deemed a significant supporter were conducted at three and twelve months following diagnosis. Interviews focused on both the experience of breast cancer and social support.  Social support and breast cancer were found complex multi-dimensional constructs. Women were agentic in mobilizing social support from a variety of sources. Effective support varied in form and type at intervals during the experience. Multiple myths and stigmas associated with cancer and breast amputation impeded the woman's mobilization of support and support attempts by members of her social network.  The research findings cogently define components of social support useful in the establishment of early intervention programs for cancer patients compatible with the complexity of processes they, and network members face dealing with cancer's unique threats and myths. Findings also provide a framework for further research on the cancer experience of disadvantaged and minority women poorly represented in cancer and social support research.

PREDICTING OUTCOME IN AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR CHRONIC PAIN (PAIN),Julie Ann Major,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278107W,/authors/OL5367550A/Julie_Ann_Major,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 87,"This paper described the nature of chronic pain syndrome and its treatment in an interdisciplinary format. Chronic pain was defined and described in both physiological and psychological terms. The literature on the efficacy of interdisciplinary treatment of chronic pain syndrome was surveyed and found to support the assertion that interdisciplinary treatment of chronic pain is the most efficacious approach.  In an attempt to predict which patients were most likely to benefit from an interdisciplinary, outpatient treatment program for chronic pain, the archival records of 100 patients were surveyed and predictions about outcome were made using a variety of demographic variables and pretreatment psychological test scores.  The subjects in this study showed significant improvements from admission to discharge, in ability to relax, maintain a consistent activity schedule, control pain, modify pain intensity, accept realistic limitations, distract themselves from the pain, sleep restfully at night and maintain a positive mood. Patients experienced a 62 percent decrease in their average pain intensity rating from admission to discharge.  Predictions about discharge functioning and discharge pain level were made using four hierarchical regression equations. Predictors included functioning at admission, pain level at admission, age, sex, race, onset and scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), including Hypochondriasis, Depression, Hysteria, Paranoia and Schizophrenia.  Results suggest that the optimal combination of variables accounted for a maximum 29.5 percent of the total variance, using the discharge average pain intensity level as the criterion. Average pain intensity level at the time of admission added significantly to the predictive utility of this equation. In a similar equation, using the discharge functioning score as the criterion, 25.2 percent of the total variance was accounted for, with the admission functioning score contributing significantly to the equation's predictive utility.  Implications for using predictions of this nature to screen out potential participants in interdisciplinary treatment programs for chronic pain are discussed. While patients showed significant improvements in many areas of functioning from admission to discharge, only average pain intensity level at admission and the admission functioning score successfully predicted this outcome.

SPIRITUAL CARE: RECIPIENTS' PERSPECTIVES (CHRISTIANITY),Diana Conco,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278094W,/authors/OL5367537A/Diana_Conco,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 111,"Nurses diagnose and treat human responses to health and illness. Human responses may be biopsychosocial and spiritual. Although nursing has a tradition of treating the whole person, nurse researchers have only investigated the spiritual dimension in the past two decades. An explication of the meaning of spiritual care from the recipients' perspectives has not been addressed.  The purpose of this qualitative study was to discover the essential structure of spiritual care by obtaining detailed descriptions of the phenomenon from those who have received such care during an illness requiring hospitalization. Participants in this study were ten volunteers obtained through advertising in a variety of settings. They emphasized the importance of spiritual care in health and well-being irrespective of medical diagnosis. All participants named Christianity as their faith background.  Data was generated through personal audiotaped open ended interviews conducted by the researcher. Participants' significant statements were extracted from transcripts of interviews. Interpretive analysis as developed by Colazzi was used to uncover meanings and to arrive at an exhaustive description of the essential structure of spiritual care. A second interview was conducted with each participant to confirm accuracy of identified significant statements and the researcher's interpretation of formulated meanings.  From the recipient's perspective, spiritual care was given and received in a context in which the recipient was physically and/or emotionally vulnerable and receptive to spiritual perspective and care. It was given by persons who established connectedness with the recipient either through showing concern, or through sharing common experiences and/or similar spiritual beliefs. Spiritual care sources, excluding spiritual caregivers, included literature, inner reflections, and calling upon one's own spiritual background and practices. Three theme clusters of spiritual care content included enabling transcending the present situation for higher meaning and purpose, enabling hope, and enabling connectedness.  Findings support the need for nurse clinicians to incorporate spiritual care in practice, for nurse educators to disseminate research findings and role model spiritual care delivery for students, and for nurse researchers to further explore the phenomenon from nurse caregivers' and recipients' perspectives.

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS' ATTENDANCE PATTERNS IN A PSYCHIATRIC PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM,Nazila Khoshkhoo Evans,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273195W,/authors/OL5363688A/Nazila_Khoshkhoo_Evans,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 154,"With the advent of deinstitutionalization, the focus of care of psychiatric patients has shifted from state hospitals to community based programs, including psychiatric partial hospitalization. Patients admitted to Partial hospital programs often have difficulty adhering to scheduled attendance which usually result in reduced patient contact with the program and threatens the continuity of care. The resultant ineffective utilization of mental health resources constitutes a chronic drain on limited resources.  A descriptive correlational study was utilized in this investigation to examine the relationship between four elements of the Health Belief Model and patients' attendance at the partial hospital program. Patient's attendance rate was operationally defined as the percentage of attendance or the ratio of the actual attendance to the scheduled attendance from admission to discharge. The independent variables were the four elements of the Health Belief Model; the perception of the accuracy of diagnosis, the perceived severity of the illness, the perceived efficacy of the partial hospital program, and the perceived costs/barriers of attending partial hospital program. The measure of self-motivation and other selected patient characteristics were added to obtain additional information.  Sample consisted of 62 consecutive admissions to a partial hospital program between April 6, 1990 and August 1, 1991. Two questionnaires; one derived from the Standardized Compliance Questionnaire, (Sackett, & Haynes, 1976), and the other, Self-Motivation Inventory (Dishman, & Ickes, 1961) were administered.  The average attendance rate was 82% which indicated a rather high rate of attendance. Patients' perception of the costs/barriers and the perception of severity were significantly and inversely correlated with attendance rate. Attendance rate was negatively correlated with the number of weeks enrolled in the program. Attendance rate was also related to race and means of transportation.  The results of the multiple regression analysis revealed that the best predictors of the patients' attendance were the patients' number of weeks and the number of days enrolled in the program and also the patients' race.  The study results indicated that the Health Belief model was useful in understanding patients' attendance behavior, but self-motivation was not a significant factor.

THE GIBSON CAREGIVER ROLE ANXIETY SCALE: INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT (CAREGIVER),Laura Young Gibson,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273148W,/authors/OL5363648A/Laura_Young_Gibson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 142,"The purpose of the research study was to examine the psychometric properties of a newly developed instrument, the Gibson Caregiver Role Anxiety Scale (GCRAS), and to determine its internal consistency reliability and construct validity. The research problem was to measure selected variables in nursing and caregiver behavior that may reduce caregiver role anxiety after a technologically dependent child is discharged from the hospital.  The study's conceptual framework was based on psychometric theory and role theory. Works on anxiety, role supplementation and role insufficiency helped construct the conceptual model for caregiver role anxiety. The independent variables selected for the model were role modeling by the nurse, and role rehearsal and role practice by the parent, with role anxiety as the dependent variable.  The study used a methodological design and basic research orientation. A pilot study provided initial estimates of internal consistency reliability and content validity.  The study sample was 129 adults who were primary caregivers for technologically dependent children aged from birth to seven years. The GCRAS questionnaire was filled out by volunteer subjects in hospitals, clinics, support groups, and homes.  For data analysis, internal consistency reliability was estimated using both factor analysis and a Cronbach's alpha correlation coefficient. Factorial validity was estimated using factor analysis.  Findings supported the reliability and validity of the instrument. The internal consistency reliability for the instrument as a whole was.8949, and for the four subscales the alpha coefficients ranged from.7004 to.8735. The factor analysis procedures produced four distinct factors with loadings of.4200 or greater that matched the variables in the model, thus supporting the validity of the conceptual model.  The newly developed instrument shows promise as a tool for measuring variables that may reduce caregiver role anxiety after a technologically dependent child is discharged from the hospital. Further testing is needed with additional samples.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF TRAUMA PATIENTS,Elizabeth Emery Hill,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12273995W,/authors/OL5364379A/Elizabeth_Emery_Hill,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 234,"Trauma, one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States today, affects the entire family system as well as the individual who sustained the injury. Being suddenly faced with someone in the family who is critically injured creates a crisis for the family. Clinical experience indicates that family members' level of distress in response to the crisis affects the welfare of patients. At a time when family members are most in need of support, nursing staff are in a position to respond appropriately. In order to provide this support, nurses need more information concerning factors which may contribute to higher levels of distress in family members.  The purpose of this study was to measure the relationship between the psychological well-being of family members of trauma patients and the variables of (a) family members' perception of as compared to actual severity of the injury, (b) etiology of the injury, (c) pile-up of family life stressors, and (d) family members' coping strategies. McCubbin's and Patterson's Double ABCX Model of stress, coping, and adaptation provided the theoretical framework guiding the study.  A descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational design was used. The sample was comprised of 88 family members of trauma patients. Instruments included the General Health Questionnaire, the Visual Analog Scale (perception of severity injury), the Trauma Score, the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales.  Four hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. Findings showed no significant correlation between psychological well-being and the study variables. Several demographic factors were identified as affecting psychological well-being. Hispanics showed a significantly higher level of distress than did either whites or blacks, and Catholics showed significantly higher levels of distress than did Protestants. Family members' psychological well-being was positively related to family member age and income, and negatively related to perception of severity of the injury. Additionally, family members were more likely to overestimate rather than to underestimate the severity of the injury.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The memoir describes her challenges with untreated, drug-resistant depression and the struggle to find an alternative to the drugs that failed to relieve her symptoms. After a grueling stay in a psychiatric ward and many months of trial-and-error medications, Rhodes pursued TMS, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, the FDA-cleared, safe and proven-effective alternative to ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and ineffective drugs. 3,000 Pulses Later shares how the road back to health with TMS returned her to an even better place than where she started. Rhodes now manages her depression with TMS therapy and without the side effects attributable to antidepressant medications.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Education improves various health outcomes but little work has been done on mental illness. To obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of education on mental health, we rely on a rich longitudinal dataset that contains health information from childhood to adulthood and thus allow us to control for fixed effects in mental health. We measure two health outcomes: malaise score and depression and estimate the extensive and intensive margins of education on mental health using various estimators. For all estimators, accounting for the endogeneity of education augments its protecting effect on mental health. We find that the effect of education is greater at mid-level of qualifications, for women and for individuals at greater risk of mental illness. The effects of education are observed at all ages, additionally education also reduces the transition to depression. These results suggest substantial returns to education in term of improved mental health""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

We are all vulnerable to addiction. Whether it's a compulsion to constantly check social media, binge eating, smoking, excessive drinking, or any other behaviors, we may find ourselves uncontrollably repeating. Why are bad habits so hard to overcome? Is there a key to conquering the cravings we know are unhealthy for us?  This book provides groundbreaking answers to the most important questions about addiction. Dr. Judson Brewer, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has studied the science of addictions for twenty years, reveals how we can tap into the very processes that encourage addictive behaviors in order to step out of them. He describes the mechanisms of habit and addiction formation, then explains how the practice of mindfulness can interrupt these habits. Weaving together patient stories, his own experience with mindfulness practice, and current scientific findings from his own lab and others, Dr. Brewer offers a path for moving beyond our cravings, reducing stress, and ultimately living a fuller life. -- Provided by publisher.

"COMMUNITY BUILDING IN LONG-TERM CARE (HOLISTIC HEALTH CARE, NURSING HOMES)",Joann Marie Gibson,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267699W,/authors/OL5359548A/Joann_Marie_Gibson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 222,"This research is a case study of a program intervention in Holistic Health Care. The goal of this program was to create a therapeutic community in a nursing home, that would meet the Holistic Health needs of the residents. Holistic Health, as it is used here, is defined as a harmonious balance of the needs of the body, mind, and spirit. The purpose of this research project was to find ways to enhance the ability of all nursing home residents to enjoy their legal right to live in an environment which promotes and protects their highest level of physical, mental, psychosocial, and spiritual well being. These rights are now established under the nursing home reform laws known as OBRA (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987).  Throughout the project, detailed ethnographic records were kept of all contacts among the residents, program staff, and the researcher. The ongoing analysis of these records refined the intervention process. A major operating premise guiding the focus of the interventions was that the institutionalized elderly need to live in an environment that meets their need for love, support, and community. Additionally, given the constant presence of death and disability, these people need the opportunity to explore their beliefs about the transcendent or mysterious aspects of life and death.  During the program development the researcher operated as a teacher, consultant, and group therapist, to help create a therapeutic milieu for staff and residents. Increased self disclosure, problem solving activities, and the use of touch, helped to produce one example of a caring community that could make ageing a more healthy experience for both the elderly and those that serve them. The next challenge, is to explore ways in which the models used here, can be successfully implemented in a range of nursing home environments.

"PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE AND DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS IN NURSING HOMES: PREVALENCE, PREDICTORS, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES (DRUG USE)",Ann L. Horgas,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL8658546W,/authors/OL2921053A/Ann_L._Horgas,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 212,"The purpose of this study was to examine (1) the prevalence of prescription drug use and drug-drug interactions (DDI) in a sample of nursing home residents, (2) the demographic and health predictors of drug use and DDI, and (3) the relationship between drug use, DDI, and health outcomes over time. The sample consisted of 174 nursing home residents who resided in four nursing homes over a one-year period. Data were collected in conjunction with a larger study of interventions in nursing homes during August 1988 and August 1989. Drug use was assessed via Medication Administration Records (MARS) kept by each facility. Drug-drug interactions were detected using two separate methods, including a computerized system and a manual reference. Residents' health status was assessed by nursing staff using both the Multidimensional Observation Scale for Elderly Subjects (MOSES) and more global ratings. Subsequent factor analyses were used to reduce health and behavior data to three parsimonious dimensions (Mental Health, Physical Health, and Behavioral Health).  The results indicated that residents were prescribed a mean of about 8 different drugs during the study interval, but they received only about 5 of those drugs, on average. The discrepancy between drugs ordered and drugs received was particularly pronounced for prn (pro re nata, or as needed) drugs, since over 90% of subjects were prescribed at least one prn medication, but only 40% actually received one during the study interval. In addition, about 30% of the residents in this sample were exposed to at least one clinically significant drug-drug interaction, though estimates differed markedly depending on the DDI detection system used. A subsequent series of regression, cross-lagged correlation, and path analyses was conducted to test the relationship between drugs and residents' physical, mental, and behavioral health over time. These analyses indicated few significant drug-health relationships. In particular, no significant health outcomes of central nervous system agents (including psychotropic drugs) were noted. Overall, the results suggest that the best predictor of Time Two drug use or health status is the residents' drug use or health status, respectively, at Time One. Implications for research, clinical practice for nurses and physicians, and public policy (especially recent legislative reform for nursing homes) were discussed.

Based on the seriousness of the symptoms, it can be measured on different scales of depression as mild or moderate.    One of the aims of the research was to find out what characterizes the state of mind of college students, whether the hopelessness, despondency and subclinical depressive mood are also typical of them. The other aim of the research was to examine and discover in their complexity those factors which have a role in the development of subclinical syndrome. The authors approach the factors responsible for the development of the subclinical syndrome in their complexity, taking into account the biological, psychic, and social relations, as well. Beyond revealing the background factors of sub-clinical depressive syndromes the authors were also interested in what the subjective well-being of college students was like and what individual aspirations were typical of them.

Cross-referenced throughout, the format encourages critical evaluation through understanding. Written by experienced and respected academics, the books are indispensable study aids and guides to comprehension.  Key Concepts in Mental Health  Mental health is an area that new students and trainee practitioners often find bewildering. This book cuts through the stigma associated with this topic. It delivers bite-sized chunks of information that cover the central concepts and debates which shape contemporary views about mental health and illness. As this book shows, these key concepts not only influence our understanding of mental health, but also govern the provision of services for people with mental health problems.  Drawing together perspectives from sociology, psychiatry, psychology and ethics, the vital topics in mental health are examined in three parts:  Mental Health and Mental Health Problems explores theories and understandings of mental health and illness  Mental Health Services looks at the structure and organisation of mental health service delivery, past and present  Mental Health and Society studies the social context.

In Souls in the Hands of a Tender God he tells the evocative stories of persons who desperately need psychiatric, psychological, and spiritual support, like Mary, who surrounds herself with huge trash bags, and Jerry, barred from every shelter and meal program in Seattle. As Rennebohm reaches out to each of them, their stories become parables that explore mental illness and the spiritual heart of care and recovery—helping us to understand what it means to be human, on a pilgrimage together toward wholeness.Souls in the Hands of a Tender God follows the path of healing and the way of companionship to build communities of caring that welcome and include our most fragile and troubled neighbors. With gentleness and grace, solid knowledge and wisdom, Rennebohm lays down the foundations of healing communities in which “all may have a home, safely rest, and be well.”   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the spirit of a sympathetic teacher, Robert Kegan guides us through this tricky curriculum, assessing the fit between its complex demands and our mental capacities, and showing what happens when we find ourselves, as we so often do, in over our heads. In this dazzling intellectual tour, he completely reintroduces us to the psychological landscape of our private and public lives. A decade ago in The Evolving Self, Kegan presented a dynamic view of the development of human consciousness. Here he applies this widely acclaimed theory to the mental complexity of adulthood. As parents and partners, employees and bosses, citizens and leaders, we constantly confront a bewildering array of expectations, prescriptions, claims, and demands, as well as an equally confusing assortment of expert opinions that tell us what each of these roles entails. Surveying the disparate expert ""literatures,"" which normally take no account of each other, Kegan brings them together to reveal, for the first time, what these many demands have in common. Our frequent frustration in trying to meet these complex and often conflicting claims results, he shows us, from a mismatch between the way we ordinarily know the world and the way we are unwittingly expected to understand it. In Over Our Heads provides us entirely fresh perspectives on a number of cultural controversies - the ""abstinence vs. safe sex"" debate, the diversity movement, communication across genders, the meaning of postmodernism. What emerges in these pages is a theory of evolving ways of knowing that allows us to view adult development much as we view child development, as an open-ended process born of the dynamic interaction of cultural demands and emerging mental capabilities. If our culture is to be a good ""school,"" as Kegan suggests, it must offer, along with a challenging curriculum, the guidance and support that we clearly need to master this course - a need that this lucid and richly argued book begins to meet.

Positive thinking, learning to deal with anger and malice, and being a part of creative social networks can extend life and lessen our chances of becoming ill. But despite overwhelming scientific evidence that mind and body are integrally related, health promotion is split into separate specialisms: mental health promotion, exercise and nutrition, social health promotion, health education and many other categories. In this unique and remarkable book David Seedhouse argues that health promoters must spurn these artificial distinctions. Instead, health promotion should aim to enhance the human experience, free from restrictive classifications and false images. In this book Professor Seedhouse has developed an exciting and potentially revolutionary health promotion tool - the rational field. Simple to use (the book contains a rational field template that can be applied by any health worker in any setting) rational fields enable health promoters to plan and act in total honesty, using whatever methods are best-suited to their quest to create autonomy. Total health promotion is: A groundbreaking approach to health promotion theory and practice Written by the world's leading philosopher of health An exhilarating read Seedhouse's argument is straightforward, impressive and written with typical elegance and clarity. But Total Health Promotion is much more than an academic text-book. It should be essential reading for all courses on health promotion and is a fantastic guide for all health promotion practitioners.

On one side, there are those who oppose involuntary psychiatric treatments under any condition. Activists who take up this cause often don't acknowledge that psychiatric symptoms can render people dangerous to themselves or others. They also don't allow for the idea that the civil rights of an individual may be at odds with the heartbreak of a caring family. On the other side are groups pushing for increased use of involuntary treatment. These proponents are quick to point out that people with psychiatric illnesses often don't recognize that they are ill, which (from their perspective) makes the discussion of civil rights moot. They may gloss over the sometimes dangerous side effects of psychiatric medications, and they often don't admit that patients, even after their symptoms have abated, are sometimes unhappy that treatment was inflicted upon them. In Committed, psychiatrists Dinah Miller and Annette Hanson offer a thought-provoking and engaging account of the controversy surrounding involuntary psychiatric care in the United States. They bring the issue to life with first-hand accounts from patients, clinicians, advocates, and opponents. Looking at practices such as seclusion and restraint, involuntary medication, and involuntary electroconvulsive therapy--all within the context of civil rights-- Miller and Hanson illuminate the personal consequences of this controversial practice through voices of people who have been helped by the treatment they had as well as those who have been traumatized by it. The authors explore the question of whether involuntary treatment has a role in preventing violence, suicide, and mass murder. They delve into the controversial use of court-ordered outpatient treatment at its best and at its worst. Finally, they examine innovative solutions--mental health court, crisis intervention training, and pretrial diversion--that are intended to expand access to care while diverting people who have serious mental illness out of the cycle of repeated hospitalization and incarceration. They also assess what psychiatry knows about the prediction of violence and the limitations of laws designed to protect the public""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How can these services be provided in a way that is easy to access and offer treatments that really work? Community mental health care has evolved as a discipline over the past 50 years, and within the past 20 years, there have been major developments across the world.The Oxford Textbook of Community Mental Health is the most comprehensive and authoritative review published in the field.  It looks at how the field has evolved, the current approaches, and combines traditional concepts, such as community-based interventions and an epidemiological perspective, with newer concepts, such as recovery philosophy, evidence-based practices, and implementation fidelity, which have shaped the field over the past decade. Like community mental health care itself, the book is multidisciplinary and pluralistic. Thoughout, it addresses controversies and also emphasizes areas of convergence, where social values, medical science, and policy forces agree on specific directions.The book will be an essential reference source for both trainee and qualified psychologists and psychiatrists involved in community mental health, as well as healthcare professionals and students, mental health service planners and commissioners, service user and carer groups""--Provided by publisher.

Some people call it ""ADHD,"" ""scatter brain,"" or ""brain fog."" And some people simply say they ""just don't feel like themselves""--and haven't for a long time. People are thinking and feeling worse than ever. Why? Because our brains are not getting the support they need to produce the essential brain chemicals that keep us energized, calm, focused, and inspired. In fact, if you look at the way that most of us live, it's almost as though we had chosen a lifestyle deliberately intended to undermine our brain chemistry. Fortunately, there is a solution. The Brain Fog Fix is a three-week program designed to help you naturally restore three of your brain's most crucial chemicals: serotonin, dopamine, and cortisol. Rebalancing these three brain chemicals will, in turn, enable the rest of your brain's chemistry to reach optimal levels. You will find yourself thinking more clearly, remembering more accurately, learning more quickly, and unleashing the floodgates of your creativity. You will also find yourself feeling more optimistic, calm, energized, connected, and inspired. The good news is that this is easier than you think. Instead of trying to ambitiously overhaul one aspect of your life entirely with some difficult-to-maintain resolution, begin by making small and achievable changes in many different areas of your life. ""If I've learned one thing from the thousands of people I've treated, it's that you have to take the whole person into account if you want to think and feel better."" --Dr. Mike Dow""--   Read more Read less",14 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book comprises an Italian translation of the notes he made on this trip, conserved in a manuscript in the library of the former psychiatric hospital of San Salvi (Florence). Offering an extremely precise and detailed review of the structures visited, the work is a fascinating and important source for the reconstruction of the history of the institutes for the insane in Italy and also for the history of psychiatry itself.

In 1960, as a suicidal teenager, Sawyer was institutionalized, misdiagnosed, and suffered through 89 electroshock treatments before being transfered, labeled as ""unimproved"". The damage done has haunted her life. Discharged in 1966, after finally receiving proper psychiatric care, Sawyer kept her past secret and moved on to graduate from Yale University, raise two children, and become a respected psychotherapist. That is, until 2001, when she reviewed her hospital records and began to remember a broken childhood and the even more broken mental health system of the 1950s and 1960s, Revisiting scenes from her childhood and assembling the pieces of a lost puzzle, her autobiography is a cautionary tale of careless psychiatric diagnosis and treatment, both 50 years ago and today. It is an informative story about understanding PTSD and making emotional sense of events that can lead a soul to darkness. Most of all, it's a story of perseverance: pain, acceptance, healing, hope, and success. Hers is a unique voice for this generation, shedding light on an often misunderstood illness.

Taking off from essays on depression she has written for The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine, Daphne Merkin casts her eye back to her beginnings to try to sort out the root causes of her affliction. She recounts the travails of growing up in a large, affluent family where there was a paucity of love and of basics such as food and clothing despite the presence of a chauffeur and a cook. She goes on to recount her early hospitalization for depression in poignant detail, as well as her complex relationship with her mercurial, withholding mother. Along the way Merkin also discusses her early, redemptive love of reading and gradual emergence as a writer. She eventually marries, has a child, and suffers severe postpartum depression, for which she is again hospitalized. Merkin also discusses her visits to various therapists and psychopharmocologists, which enables her to probe the causes of depression and its various treatments. The book ends in the present, where the writer has learned how to navigate her depression, if not ""cure"" it, after a third hospitalization in the wake of her mother's death. ""--  ""This Close to Happy is the first account to endeavor to tell the story of what it feels to suffer a lifetime's worth of clinical depression from the inside out and from a woman's point of view""--   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Family Therapy and Chronic Illness,Joan Atwood,mental_health,First published in 2017,/works/OL21330032W,/authors/OL2887423A/Joan_Atwood,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English|Pages 232,"""Treatment for the chronically ill has traditionally focused on physical factors and symptoms, despite the fact that chronic illness also affects life in an emotional and spiritual way. The approach toward treatment described in this volume addresses all aspects of a patient's life, including their interpersonal experiences and relationships, presenting family therapists and family physicians as part of the same treatment team. This volume thus provides a foundation for understanding the role illness plays in family systems. The meaning an individual gives to an illness is profoundly influenced by and influences that person's social world. In turn, social culture and social networks both shape and are shaped by the individual's experiences. Exploring how the meaning of chronic illness is defined tells us much about the individual's interpersonal relations and the resultant meaning given to the person's illness. As a consequence, family therapy must be an integral part of the treatment plan for chronically ill patients . Family Therapy and Chronic Illness approaches chronic illness from a leading-edge perspective. This approach enables therapists to listen attentively to complicated narratives. Because these stories, feelings, and emotions are difficult to describe, the clients have demanding ""telling"" tasks while therapists have demanding ""listening"" tasks. This book sends an important message not just about the chronically ill, but also about their families, therapists, and doctors, and how they can work together to develop the best treatment plan possible.""--Provided by publisher.

But then, at his 40th birthday party, his whole world crumbled as he succumbed to depression ... How many men do you know who have been through periods when their lives haven't seemed right? How badly askew were things for them? Many men suffer from depression yet it is still a subject that is taboo. Men often don't visit the doctor, or they don't want to face up to feelings of weakness and vulnerability. By telling his story, Mark Rice-Oxley hopes it will enable others to tell theirs. In this intensely moving memoir he retraces the months of his utmost despair, revisiting a landscape from which at times he felt he would never escape. Written with lyricism and poignancy, Mark captures the visceral nature of this most debilitating of illnesses with a frightening clarity, while at the same time offering a sympathetic and dispassionate view of what is happening, and perhaps why. This is not a self-help book but a memoir that is brimful of experience, understanding and hope for all those who read it. It is above all honest, touching and surprisingly optimistic.

Appreciate yourself every step of the way? And have such vitality that, even though you're perfectly proud of the age you are, people routinely think you're several years younger?This happy state is the promise of Younger by the Day, a one - year program for aging in reverse with results that start as soon as you do -- and you can start any day of the year.Victoria Moran was baffled when midlife seemed to change everything, from the shape of her body to her visibility in society. She began a four - year journey, asking these questions: Why do some women blossom with age while others wither? How can you accept yourself as you are and still nurture yourself into becoming the best you can be? How can you draw from your inner wisdom everything you need to deal with the un-certainties of life as well the certainty of growing older?Victoria found the practical answers, and they are distilled here for you to put into use, one day at a time.

Dr. Weisskopf-Joelson pursued her career in psychology at several prominent universities, including Briarcliff College in New York, Indiana University, Purdue and Duke University, and finally the University of Georgia. She also served as a clinical consultant for the state of Indiana.

Mrs. Weisskopf-Joelson kept a diary of her madness and that diary became a book, Father, Have I Kept My Promise?, published posthumously in 1988 by Purdue University.

War is as old as humankind, but in the past, warriors were prepared for battle by ritual, religion and literature -- which also helped bring them home. In a compelling narrative, Marlantes weaves riveting accounts of his combat experiences with thoughtful analysis, self-examination and his readings -- from Homer to the Mahabharata to Jung. He talks frankly about how he is haunted by the face of the young North Vietnamese soldier he killed at close quarters and how he finally finds a way to make peace with his past. Marlantes discusses the daily contradictions that warriors face in the grind of war, where each battle requires them to take life or spare life, and where they enter a state he likens to the fervor of religious ecstasy.  Just as Matterhorn is already being acclaimed as a classic of war literature, What It Is Like To Go To War is set to become required reading for anyone -- soldier or civilian -- interested in this visceral and all too essential part of the human experience.

AN ANALYSIS OF CARDIAC REHABILITATION AS AN EFFECTIVE HEALTH-PROMOTING INTERVENTION: IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING,Marlene Sue Frost,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264452W,/authors/OL5356746A/Marlene_Sue_Frost,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 296,"Using the Frost Rehabilitation Model, based on stress and coping models and health promotion models, this descriptive study investigated the relationships among self-esteem, perceived health status, social support, extent of myocardial damage, and functional status.  The sample consisted of 45 phase II cardiac rehabilitation participants from three Midwest community hospitals. The research instruments were administered when the participants entered into the phase II program and again after eight weeks of participation in the program. The instruments included a demographic and a resource questionnaire, Rosenberg's Global Self-Esteem Scale, Your Health Today Cantril Ladder, Personal Resource Questionnaire, and the Sickness Impact Profile (producing functional status, physiological and psychosocial subscale scores). Correlations and hierarchical regressions were the principal statistics used for data analysis; ANOVA, ANCOVA, and t tests were also used.  Findings showed higher self-esteem and levels of perceived health status on entry into the phase II program to be significantly correlated with healthier follow-up functional status and psychosocial subscale scores. Although entry social support did not demonstrate a significant correlation, higher level of social support on follow-up measurement were significantly correlated with healthier follow-up functional status and psychosocial subscale scores. Entry measurements of variables showed higher levels of perceived health status to be significantly correlated with healthier functional status and the psychosocial subscale scores. Follow-up measurements, however, showed higher levels of perceived health status to be significantly correlated with healthier physiological subscale scores but not functional status or psychosocial subscale scores.  After adding entry scores of the criterion varaibles (functional status, physiological status, and psychosocial status), multiple regression indicated that: (a) the extent of myocardial damage explained an additional 1% of the variance for functional status, (b) self-esteem and social support explained an additional 5% of the variance for the physiological subscale, and (c) the psychosocial subscale did not allow the addition of any other variables. Model testing showed a significant interaction effect between (a) self-esteem and extent of myocardial damage when predicting functional status, and (b) perceived health status and extent of myocardial damage when predicting psychological status.

"CONCEPTS OF MENTAL ILLNESS, HEALTH AND TREATMENT: SELECTED IDEAS THAT SHAPED AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC NURSING, 1900-1960",Sara Jane Draper,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264449W,/authors/OL5356743A/Sara_Jane_Draper,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 825,"This study was a historical analysis of selected ideas important in the development of American psychiatric nursing from 1900 to 1960. These ideas were conceptions of mental health, of mental illness, and of treatment that influenced psychiatric nurses through effects upon their intellectual discourse, nursing roles, educational preparation, and clinical practice. The author examined such influences as Adolf Meyer, the Emmanuel Movement, psychoanalysis, mental hygiene, dynamic psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine. The impact of somatic treatments and non-somatic treatments (e.g. milieu and group therapy) upon psychiatric nursing was also analyzed. The study included discussion of nurse authors such as Effie Taylor, Harriet Bailey, Helena Render, and Hildegard Peplau. The conceptualization of the nurse-patient relationship was a recurring theme throughout the study.  The study resulted in four conclusions. One, with the exception of the nurse-patient relationship, psychiatric nurses derived their ideas from other disciplines, primarily psychiatry. Two, psychiatric nurses became increasingly concerned with the definition and the analysis of their field. An early emphasis upon personal virtues and intuition of the nurse was replaced by a more reasoned and systematic scrutiny of psychiatric nursing. Three, the documents examined in this study reflected the formal knowledge of academics and the extent of its transmission to practitioners remains an open question. Four, the documents also revealed the needs and the values of educators more than those of rank-and-file practitioners.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
THE PROCESS OF DEFINITION AND ACTION: THE CASE OF DANGEROUSNESS,Anastasia A. Fisher,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265502W,/authors/OL5357689A/Anastasia_A._Fisher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 278,"Using grounded theory methodology and dimensional analysis a substantive theory was constructed, explaining the process by which psychiatric nurses define and deal with dangerousness and get along as colleagues. The study consisted of 18 subjects, including 15 nursing staff members and three nursing leaders from two locked in-patient psychiatric units. A total of 23 semi-structured interviews and 80 hours of participant observation were conducted.  In this study, dangerousness is conceptualized as a perception of the evaluator and not a characteristic of the evaluatee. As such, it represents a symbolic construction which has no essence apart from that construction. The process of defining (constructing) and dealing with dangerousness represents a sequence of events operating with two general conditions as context. These two general sets of conditions are the nurses' personal and professional histories and the general everyday events of the psychiatric unit in which the nurse works. Together, these create a ""mind-set"" or sensitivity to danger from patient action and establish for the nurse a perspective toward work, patient actions and how to read them.  Once a property or aspect of a patient's action is read as a sign of danger, in the context of professionals at work, it is rendered problematic and calls for the nurse to conduct a rapid ""natural analysis"". This natural analysis is an accumulation of all the considerations that would be brought to bear in defining anything as dangerous and includes: knowledge, professional perspectives, risk, tolerance, resources, and temporality. This analysis leads not only to an evaluation of the level of danger posed (potentiating), but also to the development of a mode of intervention to take in response to the patient event (role-take).  Since each specific patient event has some properties that are never identical with any other prior event, the process of defining and dealing with dangerousness requires negotiation among the nurses. These negotiations may precede or follow the intervention and may be formal, as in the case of a sit-down meeting, or informal as in the case of a subtle hand gesture. Interventions are designed to abate the danger posed and also operate unintentionally to ""test"" the nurses' analyses.  The process of definition and action has consequences for the patients, staff, and the unit, which become part of the nurses' experiences, influencing her next analysis. Through this process, nurses learn how their colleagues see, define, and act in particular situations. It is in this way that consensus is reached among professionals and it is this process which empirically defines dangerousness.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
PATIENT-FAMILY INTERACTIONS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: THE RELATIONSHIP OF FAMILY-OF-ORIGIN AFFECTIVE CLIMATE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS,Barbara Ann Hayes,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265449W,/authors/OL5357643A/Barbara_Ann_Hayes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 218,"This study was conducted in two stages with the following aims: (a) to examine the relationship of Expressed Emotion (EE) with negative symptoms and with positive symptoms in schizophrenia postdiagnosis (stage one); and (b) to explore the antecedents of family affective climate, negative symptoms, and positive symptoms prediagnosis (stage two).  The sample for stage one was composed of two distinct groups. One consisted of all patients (N = 62) who entered the Treatment Strategies in Schizophrenia (TSS) study at the San Francisco General Hospital site from August 1, 1985 to March 1, 1988. The second group consisted of the patient-identified principal family member (N = 62). A subset of the TSS sample comprised of patients (n = 20) and a family member (n = 16) was the sample for stage two.  Demographic statistics for both stages were similar: predominantly male, never married, young, and with a similar ethnic variation (Black, Filipino, Latino, and Caucasian). Negative symptoms were measured by the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms, positive symptoms by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, patient attitudes by the Social Adjustment Scale-II: Patient Version, family attitudes by the Social Adjustment Scale-II: Family Version, and EE by the Kreisman Patient Rejection Scale. A semistructured interview guide was used to elicit the remembered events of the patient's developmental trajectory which were considered salient by the patient and mother at four points in time.  A contextual regression was conducted for stage one data to explore the possible effect of family affective climate on patient symptoms after removing the contribution of individual characteristics. The results revealed no relationship in this sample between family attitude and patient negative symptoms nor between family attitude and patient positive symptoms. The only predictors of negative symptoms were age and social leisure. The only predictor of positive symptoms was attitude to chores. The following were the patient-generated descriptive categories of experiences reported in stage two: physical stressors, psychological stressors, peer pastimes, relocation, and cognitive delays. The pregnancy/infancy data revealed some complicated deliveries and some smaller-than-sibling birth-weights but no delay in passing developmental milestones.

"HUMOR AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PERCEIVED HEALTH, LIFE SATISFACTION, AND MORALE IN OLDER ADULTS",Jolene Marie Simon,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265228W,/authors/OL5357454A/Jolene_Marie_Simon,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 190,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between the use of humor as a coping strategy and health indicators as measured by perceived health, life satisfaction, and morale in older adults. The research question was: ""What is the relationship between the uses of humor, selected demographic variables, and health indicators in older adults?"" The theoretical frameworks used to guide this study were Lazarus and Folkman's theory of stress, appraisal, and coping in addition to the developmental contextual framework of aging.  This study is a correlational survey with a sample of 73 subjects over age 55 who are noninstitutionalized adults who attend community activities. The research instrument was a self-administered questionnaire consisting of demographic data, the Situational Humor Response Questionnaire, Coping Humor Scale, Current Health subscale of the Health Perceptions Questionnaire, Life Satisfaction Index, and the Affect Balance Scale. Data were analyzed by Pearson product-moment correlations and stepwise multiple regression.  Findings indicate significant positive relationships between situational humor, and perceived health and morale. There is also a positive relationship between coping humor, and perceived health and morale. Of the independent variables of situational humor, coping humor, residence, sex, age, living arrangements, and socioeconomic status, none are significant predictors of perceived health, whereas the variable of living arrangements is predictive of life satisfaction. Furthermore, coping humor and socioeconomic status are predictive of morale in older adults.  This study adds to the knowledge of humor as a coping strategy to life stressors, as well as a developmental concept in older adults. It will aid in generating further research with humor as a nursing intervention.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

VARIABLES INVOLVED IN NURSES' USE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS,Brenda Jane Beamer,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272932W,/authors/OL5363463A/Brenda_Jane_Beamer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 149,"Four hundred fourteen (414) nurses employed in a one-county area were surveyed relative to their drug and alcohol use and the relationship of that use to several independent variables. Questionnaires were distributed to nurses at their places of work or through the mail. Protocols were established to assure complete anonymity and confidentiality on behalf of every nurse and work place.  Alcohol use was measured by the Short-Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Drug use was measured by the Substance Abuse Screening Test, developed by the author.  Demographic variables related to outcome were: age, gender, religion, primary area of work, primary shift of work, and whether or not the nurse worked primarily on weekends, were also included.  Independent variables predicted to influence drug use were: role strain, role deprivation, parental alcohol use, multiple role conflict, disengagement from negative proscriptions against use, and access to use. All scales, except access, were 7 point Likert-type scales. Access was rated as high, medium, or low based on several variables including: area of work, shift of work and use of prescribed drugs for a medical problem. All of the independent variables were significantly related to drug use at the p $<$.05 level.  Independent variables predicted to influence alcohol use were: role strain, multiple role conflict, role deprivation, disengagement from negative proscriptions, and parental alcohol use. All of these independent variables were significantly related to alcohol use at the p $<$.05 level.

PLAYING FOR HEALTH: THE PROCESS OF PLAY AND SELF-EXPRESSION IN CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A SEXUAL TRAUMA,Elissa Anne Emerson,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273201W,/authors/OL5363694A/Elissa_Anne_Emerson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 255,"The purpose of this study was to describe the process of play and self-expression in 11 children six through nine years old who had experienced a sexual trauma. The study was focused on the healthy play impulse in the children.  The study participants took part in three videotaped play sessions that included four play contexts: Individual Free Play, Individual Guided Play, Group Free Play, and Group Guided Play. The videotapes were analyzed by content analysis.  Because play is communication for children, and because it is both real and pretense, it provided the study participants with a safe medium to express themselves, their hurts, and their healing capacities. The categories revealed in the play process included Approach, Choices, Play Activity, Show and Tell, Interacting, Self-care Behaviors, and Self-expression. Categories of self-expression included Identity, Self-satisfaction, Behavior, Preferences, Feelings, Abuse, Self-care, Attitude toward Parents and Gender, Personal Play Themes, and Non-play. All of the children in this study demonstrated effects of abuse in their lack of interactional skills, and their tendency to take the roles of abuser or victim. All showed signals of comfort during the process of play, and subsequent relaxation and fuller self-expression. The movement in play was from object to subject of reality.  The findings of this study have implications for children and for nursing practice, theory, research, and education. Implications derive from the links among the duality of the self as outlined in symbolic interactionism (Mead, 1934), the splitting of the self that takes place in response to sexual abuse, and the bipolar nature of play. Practice implications are pertinent to both assessment and intervention. Theoretical implications relate to the Self-Care Theory of Orem (1991) and Modeling and Role-modeling Theory of Erickson, Tomlin & Swain (1983). Future studies of self-care behaviors, signals of comfort, and of the play themes of safety, hiding, and pre-occupation with food would add to the body of knowledge concerning play and sexually-abused children.

COPING WITH THE MENTAL ILLNESS OF ONE'S SPOUSE (SPOUSAL COPING),Judith Eileene Broad,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273770W,/authors/OL5364202A/Judith_Eileene_Broad,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 176,"A descriptive correlational design was used to test a model which depicted relationships among personality and situational factors, the coping process and well-being in spouses with mentally ill partners. In addition, relationships between different forms of appraisal and coping responses were described.  Seventy-one spouses (49 husbands and 22 wives) of newly admitted psychiatric in-patients comprised the convenience sample. Their mean age was 55.5 years, 93% were white, 49% were employed full-time, 55% had attended college and their occupations were fairly evenly distributed across all categories. Data were collected by a psychiatric nurse during a single interview with each subject. The following measurements were used: a single item Seriousness of Illness Question, the Event Familiarity Scale, the Life Orientation Test which measures dispositional optimism, the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, the Illness Appraisal Questionnaire, the revised Ways of Coping Checklist, the Affect Balance Scale and the Brief Symptom Inventory.  Subjects were most likely to perceive their spouse's illness as serious and as a challenge. Few of the Pearson r correlations computed between appraisal responses and coping responses were statistically significant. Consistent with other studies, subjects reported using a wide variety of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies in response to the spouse's illness. Subjects' levels of psychological distress were higher than published norms for non-patients and wives were significantly more distressed than husbands.  Testing of the theoretical model with path analysis provided limited support for the role of coping strategies as mediators of distress. In addition, neither cognitive appraisal or perceived uncertainty were found to mediate distress. Dispositional optimism had the most consistent effects on both distress and happiness. Direct effects of optimism were significant in all but one test. Indirect effects of optimism were demonstrated in the presence of escape avoidance coping for men and women and in the presence of planful problem solving and reappraisal for women subjects.  Further research is warranted given the high levels of psychological distress reported by subjects. Recommendations include a longitudinal study of spousal coping, the use of family systems theory as a conceptual framework, exploration of differences in coping by men and women, examination of the influence of various symptom patterns on coping and clarification of the mechanisms through which optimism influences psychological outcomes.

"THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PERCEIVED CONTROL OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING, DEPRESSION AND LIFE SATISFACTION IN QUADRIPLEGIC ADULTS",Carole Ann Bach,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264518W,/authors/OL5356789A/Carole_Ann_Bach,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 114,"More and more individuals with spinal cord injuries are surviving their initial injury, and will be undergoing rehabilitation. As federal monies for hospital care continue to decrease, clients with spinal cord injuries will spend less time in rehabilitation. It is important for nursing to know whether perceived control of activities of daily living contribute to life satisfaction in order to determine how to focus the rehabilitation program for the client.  The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which selected demographic variables, perceived control of activities of daily living, and depression explain life satisfaction in quadriplegic adults. The framework used for examining the relationships between the major variables was Orem's Self Care Model.  The descriptive correlational study was conducted on a convenience sample of 74 noninstitutionalized quadriplegic adults between the ages of 18 ad 60. The questionnaire booklet contained demographic information, the Quality of Life Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Perceived Control of Daily Activities Scale developed by the investigator. A major portion of this research was the development of an instrument to measure perceived control of activities of daily living in the quadriplegic sample.  Data were analyzed using frequencies, correlation and multiple regression. Results from the multiple regression showed that level of depression was the only direct indicator of quality life. A reexamination and plotting of the correlation coefficients revealed that some demographic variables and Factor 4 of the Perceived Control of Daily Activities Scale contributed indirectly to quality of life through their direct relationship to the depression variable. The findings support an indirect relationship between perceived control of activities of daily living and quality of life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
PERSONAL MEANING OF CHRONIC DISRUPTION: LIVING WITH LUPUS,Nancy Ellen Leipold,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264381W,/authors/OL5356681A/Nancy_Ellen_Leipold,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 175,"Although recognized as important because of its influence on personal responses to illness, on outcomes of prescribed treatments and on the resolution of illness (Brody, 1980; Katon & Kleinman, 1980; Lipwoski, 1970; Pickering, 1979; Reading, 1977; Sanders & Kardinal, 1979; Yanagida, Streltzer & Seimsen, 1981), personal meaning, an aspect of client's perspective of illness, has had little examination. But studying meanings people give to systemic lupus erythematosus, the aim of this research is to increase general understanding of the dimensions and influences of personal meanings of illness.  Twenty people who have systemic lupus erythematosus were interviewed and asked to describe what lupus meant to them. Using the grounded field theory of comparative method analysis, subject statements were coded into categories which represent concepts of personal meaning.  Analysis revealed lupus means disruptions of personal patterns of physical action and of connections among life events. Due to physical limitations, due to the inherent variation that appears abruptly, due to inconsistent connections of personal experience that are discontinuous and unfamiliar, lupus leaves people with uncertain knowledge about the occurrence of events in their life, with the inability to complete tasks and plan personal activities and with diminished personal control. People change their patterns of physical and social action seeking to establish constancy, consistency and continuity of their experience as well as personal control. They reorder what has value and significance in their life so their values are compatible with the changes that must occur in response to the ongoing disruptions.  Lupus means adjusting to chronic disruption. Adjustment arises from the compatibility people attempt to achieve among personal patterns of action, the connections of life events, and personal values.  It is proposed the meaning of a specific illness, systemic lupus erythematosus, arises out of the disruption and interaction of personal patterns of action, connections of life events and personal values. A model for adjusting to disruption, a personal response to lupus, is described.  Further research is necessary to demonstrate if these concepts of personal meaning and the explanation of adjusting to chronic disruption by people who have lupus can accurately describe others meanings and responses to disruption.

PSYCHIATRIC CONSULTATION INTENSITY AND NURSING RESOURCE USE,Gail Alice Mallory,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264278W,/authors/OL5356586A/Gail_Alice_Mallory,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 228,"The demographic, psychosocial, and case-mix characteristics of a stratified random sample of 150 general hospital patients receiving varying amounts and types of consultation-liaison (C/L) psychiatry and C/L nursing services were examined in this retrospective study. Relationships between: (a) intensity and type of C/L services and nursing resource use, and (b) C/L intensity and utilization of C/L recommendations were also explored.  The analysis of the data indicated that there are several unique subpopulations of C/L service patients. Subjects in the high intensity group demonstrated significantly higher resource use in terms of: (a) length of hospitalization (LOS), (b) average standard nursing hours per day of hospitalization, (c) contacts by both a C/L psychiatrist and a C/L nurse, (d) both direct and indirect C/L contacts, and (e) discharge to another health care facility.  The low intensity group consisted of two subgroups: one subgroup of patients with psychiatric diagnoses or history upon admission to the hospital (concurrent psychiatric and physical disorders), and a second subgroup with a primary physical disorder and psychological symptoms (adjustment disorder or no psychiatric diagnosis).  The medium intensity group (representing the majority of C/L patients) was found to have a moderately positive correlation (r =.53, p $<$.01) between timing of the C/L referral during the hospitalization and LOS, suggesting that if C/L referrals were made earlier in the hospitalization, LOS may decrease. This group also had the largest amount of decrease in nursing resource utilization from before to after C/L initial contact.  Future studies should focus on specific subgroups of general hospital patients (both with and without C/L contact) in order to meaningfully determine the types, timing, and amount of C/L services that may be most effective in improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care.

EMOTIONAL REFERENCING: THE DEFINITION AND MANAGEMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH BY OLDER WOMEN,Merrie J. Kaas,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12263989W,/authors/OL5356329A/Merrie_J._Kaas,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 202,"Although older women have been identified as utilizing the mental health care system more than older men, they account for a small percentage of mental health care use (NCHS, 1987a, 1987b). Little is known about how older women take care of their mental health, including help-seeking.  This qualitative research study was conducted to explore how older women take care of their mental health. The grounded theory approach, employing partially structured interviews, was used to collect and analyze data. All interviews were taped and transcribed. The constant comparative method was used to generate substantive theory about how older women define and manage their mental health. The subjects of this study were 30 community living women ages 55-86 who resided in two areas: San Francisco Bay area and a rural Wisconsin area.  A grounded theory of EMOTIONAL REFERENCING emerged as the process that these older women used to define and manage their mental health. EMOTIONAL REFERENCING is a three-step process of comparing, defining, and managing. During the comparing step, the older woman compares her present mental health with her own prior experiences and the experiences of others. This intrapersonal and interpersonal comparing serves to find affective, cognitive, and behavioral reference points on which to define her mental health. It is at the defining step that the older woman defines her mental health in one of three phases. Depending on the phase, the woman then identifies strategies that she can use to maintain or improve her mental health. These strategies include activities she can do alone or to get help. Biographical and situational conditions influence the process of EMOTIONAL REFERENCING, while other conditions influence the management of mental health.  Findings of this study indicate that older women: (a) use a process to define and manage their mental health, (b) have a different definition for mental health than for mental illness, (c) define mental health differently than professionals do, (d) perceive mental health as regularly fluctuating, and (e) most often manage their mental health alone, without seeking professional help.

GRIEF RESOLUTION IN HOSPICE NURSES: AN EXPLORATION OF EFFECTIVE METHODS,Georgene Gaskill Eakes,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264434W,/authors/OL5356727A/Georgene_Gaskill_Eakes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 163,"Since hospice nurses are responsible for providing care to individuals during the final phases of life, they frequently must confront the profoundness of bereavement and grief, but they are not prepared for this through their nursing education programs. The purpose of this study is to explore how hospice nurses who repeatedly experience the deaths of patients effectively resolve their grief and to identify the implications for designing effective educational programs. The rationale for this study is the need to understand how hospice nurses resolve grief in order that educators can develop strategies to better prepare nurses to work with terminally ill patients.  This study uses a multi-subject case study approach to explore how hospice nurses effectively resolve grief associated with patients' deaths. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with five Registered Nurses functioning in home-bound hospice care settings provide the data base.  The principal themes which emerge regarding grief resolution strategies used among this sample of hospice nurses are: (1) The establishment of a collaborative nurse/patient relationship is central to the nurses' abilities to resolve grief. (2) Open and honest ventilation of feelings activated by the deaths of patients assists the nurses to work through these feelings. (3) The maintenance and use of a solid support system by the nurses is an important factor in grief resolution. (4) Cultivation of and participation in diversional activities is necessary in order for the nurses to maintain a balance between their personal and professional lives. (5) Achieving a sense of closure to the nurse/patient relationship assists the nurses to disengage from the lost relationship and prepares them to be able to reinvest in new relationships with terminal patients.  This dissertation argues that nurses need to be educated to deal effectively with the grief associated with deaths of patients. Further, educational efforts addressing the coping strategies identified in this study must be directed to those nurses already employed in the health/care delivery system as well as those receiving their basic nursing education preparation.

Studies on depression frequently reveal that many patients remain depressed posthospitalization. The purpose of the study was to describe existing relationships among the variables Patient Perception of Ward Atmosphere, Nurse Perception of Ward Atmosphere, Personality Characteristics, Depression, and Length of Hospitalization for a sample of depressed psychiatric inpatients.  Thirty-four randomly sampled hospitals participated in the study. Ninety-four patients and 56 nurses participated. Patients completed the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF), the Ward Atmosphere Scale (PWAS), the Center for Epidemiology on Depression Scale (CES-D) and a Demographic Form. Nurses completed the Ward Atmosphere Scale (NWAS) and a Demographic Form.  Data were analyzed using the LISREL VI computer program and multiple regression. Results of the study revealed that the postulated model was inaccurate. Results of the study also indicated that 8.8% of the variance in Length of Hospitalization was explained by the PWAS variable of Order and Organization and the Personality variable Tough Poise. Further, the Personality variables of Anxiety and Extraversion, and the NWAS variable Involvement accounted for 42% of the variance in Depression.  The results of the study indicated that high interpersonal involvement is associated with decreased depressive symptoms. The study's findings also suggest that patients' perceptions of psychiatric units as orderly and organized are associated with shorter hospital stays. The findings indicate, however, that perception of ward atmosphere may have a differential effect on patients with certain personality characteristics. Moreover, the lack of a significant relationship between Length of Hospitalization and Depression in the study indicate that preferences for long or short-term hospital stays should not be based exclusively on the presence or absence of depressive symptoms.  Recommendations were made to conduct a similar study using measures that are reliable and valid. Recommendations were also made to explore the role of social involvement in the development and maintenance of depression.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In addition, this study identified ways in which psychiatric nurses could have intervened to help the wives cope more effectively with their stress.  Wives experienced a multitude of behavior difficulties related to their husbands' illness. In turn, wives reported social, economic, and psychological upheaval. Anxiety, sympathy, grief, and avoidance were the most frequent reactions of the wives to their husbands' mental illness. Older women tended to report fewer maladaptive reactions to their husbands' mental illness than younger women.  Wives attempted to reduce stress in the family by bearing alone the burden of the situation, thereby shielding younger children with lesser coping abilities. Because the traditional support mechanisms, family and friends, of many of the wives failed, the wives either expressed an interest in or were in therapy.  The majority of wives indicated that they did not consider asking the nurses for help believing that the nurses were there to help their husbands. However, wives reported that knowledge of mental illness and understanding of their situation were two types of help they would have wanted from the psychiatric nurses. Furthermore, wives indicated that nurses' aid would have been helpful in understanding mental illness, preserving their marriage, reducing tension, anxiety and friction, and gaining control over their lives.  Finally, the conclusions and implications of this study recognized the coping and adaptation used by wives in handling the mental illness of their husbands and stressed the need for therapeutic support of wives of mentally ill patients. In addition, the role of psychiatric nurses was reaffirmed in reducing environmental stress among families experiencing coping difficulties related to mental illness.

Ninety-seven community mental health centers were selected from lists supplied by the Illinois Association of Community Mental Health Centers and the State Department of Mental Health, based upon their major focus for patient care as the mentally ill. Data were collected from a questionnaire that surveyed nurses who worked in community mental health centers.  Results showed that the sample of nurses was slightly older than the national population. Most had been hired within the last five years. There were less than two nurses/agency, far below the national average. The relationship between education and practice role was that nurses with advanced degrees worked more with children and were instructors. There was little relationship between entry levels into practice and assigned roles. There were few regional differences, but nurses residing in Chicago and its metropolitan environs held more BSN and MSN degrees and had more clinical experiences as students in community mental health.  Nurses made their decisions to enter community mental health nursing based on experience acquired as graduates in another practice setting, rather than based on student experiences. Community Mental Health Nurses perceived their unique contributions to the care of the mentally ill as their ability to do physical, psychosocial assessments; their knowledge about medications and disease processes; their ability to negotiate both systems of care, the mental health and the medical systems. They perceived themselves as focusing on health promotion more than their mental health colleagues. They perceived their unique contributions were based on their holistic conceptual framework, since they also perceived themselves as psychotherapists. They enjoyed working in a community mental health setting because they experienced more autonomy and had the opportunity to focus their practice on the patient rather than the task.

As a possible secondary source of data, subjects completed instruments adapted from Russell's (1982) Causal Dimension Scale. Demographic information was collected in order to study the relationship between patient and staff characteristics and the attributional dimensions.  Several approaches were used in the analysis of data. In the principle method comparing patient and staff responses coded in a standard approach (Elig and Frieze, 1975), significant differences between patient and staff attributions were found on the stability and controllability dimensions. Patient and staff internal attributions did not differ significantly. The slightly stable attributions of patients were significantly different (p = .03) from the staff's slightly unstable attributions. Patients' uncontrollable attributions significantly differed (p = .00) from the controllable staff reasons. Data analysis using the Patient and Helper Attribution Scales indicated that patient and staff responses were significantly different on the locus of causality dimension, although confidence in these results was weakened by the poor reliability of these instruments with study subjects. Comparisons of patient and staff responses coded into content categories also yielded differences between the two groups. While the majority of subjects cited factors within the person as the chief cause for readmission, staff primarily attributed rehospitalization to non-compliance, while patients named a variety of factors but most commonly identified chronic psychological factors. Finally, multiple regression analysis indicated that for patients and staff, a few variables predicted attributional dimensions but differences between group mean scores were not significant using Scheffe tests. Staff and patient variables made only a small contribution to the variance in attribution dimension scores.  Although no direct clinical applications can be drawn from the study, the results support findings in other studies of differences between helpers and helpee. The possible affective and behavioral consequences of patient and staff rehospitalization attributions, their relevance for nursing and implications for further research are discussed.

TRUST AND SELF-ESTEEM OF PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS AS PERCEIVED BY THE PATIENTS AND PSYCHIATRIC NURSES (ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIPS),Lorna Andrews Larson,mental_health,First published in 1985,/works/OL12262670W,/authors/OL5355175A/Lorna_Andrews_Larson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1985|Pages 165,"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relationship of trust to self-esteem for psychiatric patients and the extent that psychiatric nurses' perceptions concurred with patients' perceptions of their trust and self-esteem. The theoretical framework utilized was Erikson's ego development theory supported by Rosenberg's self-esteem theory and Combs and Snygg's perceptual constructs.  The sample consisted of 43 one-to-one nurse-patient diads from a public mental hospital. The patients completed Rosenberg's Self-esteem and Faith in People Scales, and the patient's one-to-one nurse completed the same scales the way he/she thought the patient had. The nurses also assessed their patients' self-esteem and trust on a Likert scale. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, the paired t-test, the kappa, correlations and step-wise regressions.  The patients' and nurses' scores for the patients' trust and self-esteem were significantly correlated but not sufficiently to suggest that they were measuring the same variable. In contrast, the nurses' assessments of their patients' trust and self-esteem had such high correlations with each other that, without objective criteria for guidance, nurses seemed to have difficulty distinguishing between the patients' trust and self-esteem. Nurses' perceptions did not concur to a significant degree with the patients' perceptions of their trust and self-esteem.  Patients with paranoia/paranoid schizophrenia showed higher levels of self-esteem, and those with a substance abuse or affective disorder showed lower levels of trust. The longer nurses had worked with the patients the higher they assessed the patients' self-esteem.  Discussion focused on the implications of the findings for the study hypotheses and for several aspects of nursing: theoretical, clinical, administrative, research. Suggestions for further investigations were proposed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN WOMEN,Luth Mendiola Tenorio,mental_health,First published in 1986,/works/OL12263257W,/authors/OL5355659A/Luth_Mendiola_Tenorio,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1986|Pages 146,"The purpose of the experimental study (posttest-only control group) was to determine the effectiveness of aerobic exercise in reducing depression in women. Selye's neurophysiological theory of stress served as the framework for the study. The sample consisted of 62 subclinically depressed women, ages 18-33, who were self-selected using an inclusion criteria and randomly assigned to either experimental or control group.  Data were collected using five questionnaires and three physiological measures. The questionnaires were self-administered health history, Psychiatric Epidemiological Research Inventory (PERI), Demographic, Center for Epidemiological Studies--Depression (CES-D) Scale, and Aerobic Exercise Assessment (AEA). The physiological measures were weighing scale, mercury blood pressure apparatus, and treadmill ECG monitoring system. The treatment consisted of 50 minutes aerobic exercises, three times weekly for eight weeks at 80% intensity sustained for 20 to 25 minutes.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Scheffe, multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed to test three null hypotheses.  Results indicated statistically significant differences in postmaximum oxygen uptake (VO(,2) max) at .0001 level and in postdiastolic blood pressure (p < .026). A significant difference was also found in depressive symptomatology (p < .005) between experimental and control groups. A significant interaction was found between aerobic exercise, age, religion, and depression (p < .024).  The study corrects major methodological flaws found in previous investigations and extends the small body of knowledge on cardiovascular fitness and depression in women. Results have implications for assertively utilizing aerobic activities as interventions that promote self-responsibility in preventing a potentially chronic mental health problem. Results of the study could provide data for defining nursing's independent and collaborative roles in relation to a health promotive activity that is popular among women nationwide. A replication of the study which includes measurements of biochemical changes associated with depression and exercise in women populations with more varied sociological variables is recommended.

MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND THE IDEOLOGIES OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSES,Joan Margaret Flagg,mental_health,First published in 1984,/works/OL12261461W,/authors/OL5354044A/Joan_Margaret_Flagg,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1984|Pages 275,"The purposes of the study were: (1) to describe the professional ideologies of specialists in psychiatric and mental health nursing as expressed through opinions and attitudes related to mental health policy alternatives, and (2) to describe the relationships between characteristics of the subjects and beliefs about mental health policy issues. Theoretical bases of the investigation were drawn from two major sources. Concepts from the sociology of knowledge were applied to understanding the development of professional ideologies through social process. Development of public policy was described through the application of systems theory. Psychiatric and mental health nursing was seen as developing to a significant degree out of government mental health policy and now concerned with providing input into further policy development.  Members of the American Nurses' Association Council of Specialists in Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing (N = 403) completed a questionnaire developd for the study. The questionnaire consisted of 73 items to assess beliefs and opinions on mental health policy issues and questions related to respondent characteristics. Opinion items were factor-analyzed to identify belief patterns of the respondents. Four factors were identified and named according to their content: Mental Health Systems and Services; Locus of Responsibility; Medical Model Orientation; and Attitudes and Ethics. Respondents took a conservative position on expansion of publicly-supported mental health care, but considered government responsible for providing services. Some aspects of a medical model approach to mental health were endorsed. Beliefs identified with community mental health ideology were supported.  Discriminant analyses were carried out with the opinion items as independent variables and demographic and professional characteristics of respondents as dependent variables. It was found that significant differences of opinion existed between subgroups on all the characteristics examined. In setting policy agendas and professional development goals, psychiatric and mental health nurses should be aware of both the shared core of beliefs and concerns and the significant differences of opinion on specific issues which exist within the discipline.

"DEATH OF AN INFANT WEIGHING LESS THAN 500 GRAMS AT BIRTH: THE PARENTAL EXPERIENCE (INFANT DEATH, LOW BIRTHWEIGHT)",Karen Lynn Kavanaugh,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272691W,/authors/OL5363260A/Karen_Lynn_Kavanaugh,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 279,"Although the importance of providing support to families who experience a perinatal loss has been documented, the responses of parents experiencing the death of an infant weighing less than 500 grams at birth have not been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of parents surrounding the death of a live-born infant weighing less than 500 grams at birth.  Five mothers and three fathers who had experienced the recent death (within two months) of a live-born infant weighing less than 500 grams at birth participated in the study. A total of 18 in-depth, open-ended, interviews were conducted approximately one month and two months after the loss. The interviews were tape-recorded, and transcribed onto computer files. Then, written transcriptions of the interviews were generated, and the data from the interviews were analyzed using a phenomenological approach.  Six common themes were identified from the data. The first theme, realization that the loss is occurring, was characterized by turmoil and considerable differences among parents. The second theme, initial response to the loss, was characterized by gender differences and pain and/or exhaustion. The third theme, decision making at the time of the loss, included personal and stressful decisions that had to be made by parents in the immediate post-birth period. The fourth theme, components of supportive relationships with others, included accepting the parent's feelings and behaviors, being there, sharing the experience, keeping the parent informed, providing competent care, and giving special attention. The fifth theme, making the adjustment at home, was characterized by gender differences, and included responding to the loss, relating to others, using coping behaviors, and assigning meaning to the loss. The sixth theme, the future, included a discussion of a subsequent child or pregnancy and related fears. These themes served as the basis for an exhaustive description of the parental experience, which was validated by the study participants.  The study findings can assist clinicians to provide sensitive, research-based interventions for families who experience the loss of an infant weighing less than 500 grams. Recommendations for subsequent research in this area are delineated.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
FAMILY SUPPORT: FACTORS INFLUENCING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CAREGIVER FUNCTIONING,Patricia Ann Chiverton,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272511W,/authors/OL5363105A/Patricia_Ann_Chiverton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 131,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to the loss of cognitive ability with a resulting decrease in day to day functioning. Studies have shown that caring for a demented relative impacts on the caregiver's physical and mental health. This study theorized that the caregiver's resources and perception, combined with patient deficits and caregiver illness, influence caregiver functioning. A conceptual framework for examining these relationships was drawn from the literature on Family Stress Theory.  The study sample included 91 primary caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients followed at the Older Adult and Memory Disorders Clinic at Strong Memorial Hospital or attending Alzheimer's Association support groups. Sixty-six caregivers were spouses, sixteen daughters, five sons, three sisters, and one grandson.  The data were collected from a self-report questionnaire. The Memory-Behavior Problem Checklist and Caregiver Illness Checklist were used to measure health status. Caregiver resources were measured using the Social Support Questionnaire and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Scale. The Boundary Ambiguity and Mastery Scales were used to obtain information about the caregiver's perception of the situation. Caregiver functioning was measured with the General Health Survey.  The data were descriptively analyzed using frequency distributions and measures of central tendency for the variables. Relationships among the variables were then investigated using the correlation analysis. Six models, based on the literature, were tested using structural equation modeling. A seventh model based on the results of the correlation analysis was also tested.  The results of the study indicated that it is the positioning of the variables within the models that determined whether the pathways were significant. Mastery was found to be an important variable; however, it may be the relationship between mastery and resources that is key. In the models of best fit, resources have a direct effect on mastery which has a direct effect on caregiver functioning. Boundary ambiguity was also found to be an important variable; however, it had a different effect from that anticipated. It was found to be more directly related to the caregiver's sense of mastery and use of resources rather than having a direct effect on caregiver functioning.

"UNCERTAINTY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, THREAT, COPING SELF-CARE, EMOTIONS, AND COPING EFFECTIVENESS IN POST-MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION SUBJECTS: A TEST OF TWO PROPOSED CAUSAL MODELS",Susan J. Bennett,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12272520W,/authors/OL5363114A/Susan_J._Bennett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 250,"The descriptive correlational study was designed to investigate selected theoretical relationships from Lazarus' (1966; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) phenomenological model of stress and coping. The effects of constructs including perceived availability of social support, uncertainty, degree of threat, coping self-care, and emotions on coping effectiveness were examined. The convenience sample consisted of 81 post-myocardial infarction (MI) clients enrolled in phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs.  Two hypothesized causal models were analyzed using LISREL VI (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1985). Independent variables were perceived availability of social support, uncertainty, threat, coping self-care, and emotions. Coping effectiveness was the dependent variable. The two models differed in the placement of emotions. In Model I, emotions were proposed to be an outcome of coping self-care and in Model II, emotions were proposed to be an outcome of threat. Demographic variables (age, gender, and length of time since hospitalization) and nature of the stressful situation were measured to determine their effects upon the study variables. Based on chi-square values and goodness of fit indices (GFI), neither proposed causal model fit the data.  A revised model which fit the data was proposed. In the revised model, consistent with recent conceptualizations (Folkman & Lazarus, 1988c), emotions were an outcome of threat. Social support directly effected uncertainty, problem- and emotion-focused coping self-care and coping effectiveness. Uncertainty directly effected emotions. Emotions directly effected problem-focused coping and coping effectiveness. Contrary to theoretical propositions, threat did not directly effect coping self-care and coping self-care did not directly effect coping effectiveness in the revised model. The independent variables accounted for 63% of the variance in coping effectiveness in the revised model.  Alternative explanations for the study findings are discussed, including theoretical and measurement issues. The subjects being enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation programs, which may be a form of coping, could have contributed to the findings.

SECURING LIFE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE: THE FIRST SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION OF A TRANSVENOUS INTERNAL CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR,Laura Jean Burke,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279920W,/authors/OL5369146A/Laura_Jean_Burke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 283,"The purpose of this study was to generate a grounded theory to understand the perceptions and experiences of people who live with a transvenous internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) during the first six months following implantation. The research question answered by this study was ""How do people report experiencing their lives during the first six months following a transvenous ICD implantation?"".  A qualitative research design using the grounded theory method was employed in this study. Subjects were recruited from two midwestern medical centers. Three in-depth, audiotaped interviews were conducted with each subject within one week following transvenous ICD implantation, and again at three and six months post-implantation. Through open-ended questions based on time-dependent interview guides, subjects defined what they considered to be relevant issues and clarified the interrelatedness of conceptual categories that emerged from the data. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative analysis method.  A total of 24 subjects were included in this study. All but one subject completed all three interviews. The typical subject was male, Caucasian, married, a high school graduate, and had lived with ventricular dysrhythmias for less than two months.  The core variable that described the experience of living with a transvenous ICD during the first six months after implantation was the process of ""securing life through technology acceptance."" This was a deliberative process to reduce perceived vulnerability and intrusion associated with sudden cardiac death by making a decision to live with technology. It also involved making changes in oneself, one's way of life, and the technology to assure personal survival and life quality. Securing life through technology acceptance was characterized by three major categories: choosing life with technology, integrating technology into life, and living life through technology. Each of these categories is defined and the relationships between the categories are explained.  The findings of this study suggest that the driving force for technology use is primarily to assure survival, and secondarily, to regain, maintain, or enhance life quality. Implications for nursing and future research are presented.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
MENTAL HEALTH CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALISTS' INTERPRETATIONS OF DIFFICULT CLIENT BEHAVIOR,Cheryl Ann Laskowski,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280437W,/authors/OL5369584A/Cheryl_Ann_Laskowski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 338,"Twelve mental health clinical nurse specialists working in outpatient mental health settings were interviewed and asked to describe situations where they had experienced ""difficult"" client behavior. Study data, analyzed via the grounded theory methodology, revealed the basic social process of Evolving Meaning. Evolving Meaning signified change in CNSs' interpretations over time, based on both Enhancing Experience and Expanding Understanding. The phases of Personal Meaning, Negotiating Meaning and Illuminating Meaning were recognized as central to the basic social process of Evolving Meaning.  Personal Meaning involved the CNS's History and Boundaries. Client behavior was often described as ""difficult"" when the behavior violated the CNS's boundaries and ""pushed the buttons"" of the CNS study participant.  When the CNS interpreted a client's behavior as ""difficult"" she experienced the closely related components of Feelings and Clinical Thinking. As a result of Feelings and Clinical Thinking, the CNS moved to Negotiate Meaning with clients by using certain strategies. Concurrently, she moved to Illuminate Meaning by Going In and/or Going Out. When the CNS experienced Going In, she used introspection to explore her Feelings in response to client behavior. Going Out involved the CNS's consultation with helpful others, often in the form of clinical supervision.  Outcomes of the phase of Negotiating Meaning resulted, at times, in Enhancing Experience. Outcomes of Negotiating Meaning also resulted in the CNS's moving to Illuminate Meaning so as to shed light on the CNS-Client interaction. As a result of Illuminating Meaning, the CNS developed Expanding Understanding.  The entire phenomena of Evolving Meaning was recognized as occurring within the context of Macrosystem Factors. These Macrosystem Factors were helpful, hindering, confounding and/or expansive for the CNS study participants.  All of the study participants emphasized the importance of ongoing clinical supervision. Several CNSs suggested that graduate education focus less on techniques and more on the development of the CNS-client relationship. Further, graduate education could include an emphasis on the exploration of Macrosystem Factors, as CNSs who are well informed about Macrosystem Factors are in a position to affect future system-wide change.

AMBULATION BEHAVIORS OF PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: CASE STUDIES OF RESIDENTS ON THREE FACILITIES ALONG THE HOMELIKE CONTINUUM,Laura May Struble,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280535W,/authors/OL5369679A/Laura_May_Struble,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 247,"An embedded multiple case study design was used to examine the impact of physical environment on ambulation behavior for six cases with Alzheimer's disease within a real-life context. The descriptive observational approach aimed to identify and describe associations between ambulation behaviors and characteristics of the physical and social environment. Three settings (institutional, hotel-like, & home-like) were selected to demonstrate unique philosophical and environmental design issues across the continuum between institutional and homelike settings. Each case's level of impairment was described regarding: gait and balance testing, functional performance of activities of daily living, observed ambulation behaviors, and cognitive function.  Ambulation behaviors (number of episodes, travel patterns, self-initiated activities, social contacts and negative consequences) were recorded on a palm held video camera over a 48 hour period. Ambulation episodes, time spent in each location, ambulation travel patterns, negative consequences of ambulation, and social contacts were recorded over a 48 hour period. Data were summarized using descriptive techniques.  Home-Like Facility had the following positive outcomes: high number of episodes, more time spent ambulating, efficient travel, environmental ownership activities, and high number of social contacts. This was attributable to its: social model, small scale, visual access to multiple locations, familiar and engaging physical attributes, and individualized policies and procedures. The Hotel-Like Facility produced strikingly different outcomes than the other two facilities (i.e. low number of episodes, least time ambulating, inefficient travel, public activities, low number of social contacts). This was likely due to the large scale size, crowding and service style policies and procedures.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
THE NATURE OF NURSES' EXPERIENCES IN FOR-PROFIT PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL SETTINGS (PATIENT ABUSE),Wanda Krystyna Mohr,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280337W,/authors/OL5369492A/Wanda_Krystyna_Mohr,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 315,"The purpose of my research was to determine how nurses experienced their professional situations during the time in which crucial events unfolded that resulted in the allegations of for-profit psychiatric hospitals engaging in fraud, patient abuse and unethical conduct. The focus of my inquiry centered on ethical misgivings, sense-making and the concept of patient advocacy within a context that is presumed to have presented multiple ethical contradictions to the nurse informants.  In this qualitative study I employed Denzin's (1989) interpretive interactionism method as a sensitizing approach. My intent was to understand the lived experiences of these nurses through their narrated epiphany experiences by using Denzin's method and to contextualize the findings within a larger environmental context using a number of archival and historical sources. The findings will provide information about the nature of nurses' experiences with circumstances that might preclude or facilitate various advocacy activities that they might take in behalf of clients and thereby improve quality of work life for nurses and quality of care for a vulnerable population of clients. I based my informant selection on a theoretical sampling of nurses who were employed in for profit psychiatric hospitals in Texas between the years of 1985-1991.  Seven themes were culled from the nurses' narratives. These were labeled: naivete, awareness, pain, resistance-action, rejection to resistance, climacteric and denouement. Conclusions suggest that nurses felt poorly prepared for their roles; they often failed to recognize and deal with individual and organizational deviance; they were subjected to intimidation tactics by management when they took patient advocacy positions; when confronted with situations they felt powerless to influence or exit, they ""bracketed off"" their feelings and focused on tasks. The results have policy, research, education and practice implications inasmuch as health care delivery is becoming increasingly management controlled and profit-oriented.  This research constitutes the initial phase of an ongoing program of research in which I intend to examine the outcomes with respect to the clients who were present in these hospitals.

INDIVIDUAL CAREGIVING ATTITUDES OF NURSE AIDES AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES: AN ORGANIZATIONAL DEMOGRAPHY PERSPECTIVE,Nicholas George Castle,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280307W,/authors/OL5369462A/Nicholas_George_Castle,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 278,"The first purpose of this dissertation is to investigate how individual caregiving attitudes vary in relationship to the demographic composition of the work group. The second purpose is to investigate whether these caregiving attitudes affect residents in nursing homes. The orientation towards rehabilitative resident care and maintenance resident care by sub-groups of nurse aides is the caregiving attitude investigated. The mental health stability of residents is the outcome measured.  The prediction that minority group nurse aides with high levels of racial similarity to the rest of the work group will have stronger maintenance care orientations than will Minority group nurse aides with low levels of racial similarity to the rest of the work group is supported. However, the prediction that Caucasian nurse aides with high levels of racial similarity will have stronger rehabilitation care orientations than will Caucasian nurse aides with low levels of similarity is not supported.  The prediction that long-tenured nurse aides with high levels of tenure similarity will have stronger rehabilitation orientations than will long-tenured nurse aides with low levels of similarity is supported.  The prediction that adverse mental health symptoms in residents are less likely to increase over time in nursing units where the rehabilitative care orientation is strong is not supported. The prediction that adverse mental health symptoms in residents are more likely to increase over time in nursing units where the maintenance care orientation is strong is also not supported. Although, it was found that with a more appropriate, but smaller sub-sample (n = 43) of nurse aides, that the rehabilitation care orientation of nurse aides is correlated with a decrease in the mental health outcomes of residents.  The within unit variation of the nurse aides care orientation towards residents could also affect the mental health stability of residents. It was found that an increase in the unit level variance of the care orientation of nurse aides is associated with a increase in the memory problems of residents over the six month time period. However, an increase in the unit level variance in care orientation of nurse aides is associated with a decrease in the disorientation problems of residents over the six month time period.

A purposive sample of Alzheimer's caregivers was selected from 6 Alzheimer's support groups located within the Upstate of South Carolina. The caregivers were systematically randomly assigned to two groups, experimental (n = 29) and control (n = 28). The experimental group received three two-hour informational sessions over a two month period spaced evenly apart. The control group did not receive the informational series. After completion of the informational series, the Brief Symptoms Inventory (BSI) was administered to both the experimental and control groups.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to determine if informational support decreased perceived stress of Alzheimer's caregivers at the 0.05 significance level suggests that there were no significance differences between the experimental and control groups. In addition, no significant differences were found for anxiety, depression or hostility as measured by the BSI.  Significant differences were found when demographic variables were applied. These differences were noted if the caregiver was a daughter-in-law, if health was considered poor and if socioeconomic conditions were perceived as inadequate.

Role theory was used to construct a theoretical framework. Role functions or operationalized items of nursing care were considered to be norms or standards of practice. Norms or standards of psychiatric nursing practice were identified as existing within Standard V of the ANA Standards of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing Practice (1982). The components of intervention roles described in ANA Standard V were operationalized with the assistance of experts in psychiatric nursing. After several trials, twenty items were organized into a questionnaire which elicited perceptions of ideal and actual practice.  The final instrument was administered to 179 R.N. psychiatric staff nurses in three public and six private psychiatric settings. Construct validity of the questionnaire was demonstrated through factor analysis. Internal consistency was indicated by Cronbach's alpha of .893.  Frequencies of responses to the Ideal Scale indicated that most staff nurses considered the items to represent practices which are ideal for a majority of their patients. The non-parametric Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test indicated that respondents perceived their ideal practice to include each item more often than their actual practice. Multiple regression analysis revealed that none of the recorded personal characteristics of the staff nurses predicted their responses.  Further testing of the instrument on a broader sample is recommended. The items of practice which were operationalized may be developed through future research for purposes of reimbursement and quality assurance.

EXPERIENCES AND COPING STRATEGIES OF PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA,Susan Marie Godschalx,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12263717W,/authors/OL5356070A/Susan_Marie_Godschalx,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 127,"The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences and coping strategies of people with schizophrenia living in the community. The study answered three research questions: How do people with schizophrenia perceive their situation? How do people cope when a stressful perception of the situation is made? and What are the experiences of people diagnosed with schizophrenia living in the community?.  Thirty randomly selected people between the ages of 21 and 35 with schizophrenia living in the community were interviewed using a semistructured open-ended interview format. The content analyses of the audiotaped, transcribed interviews were the basis of the description of living life with schizophrenia.  People perceive the situation of mental illness in a variety of ways, frequently holding more than one perception. Seven approaches of managing stressful perceptions of the situation emerged from the interviews. Three major dimensions, seeking security, finding meaning, and managing emotional pain, described life experience. Additionally, the content analyses provided the base for the conceptualization of Like Everyone Else. This concept describes the pervasive concern for and realization of one's normality which was seen in, and transcended, all dimensions of life. People with schizophrenia experience normality as both goal and reality.  This research provided the base for life-situation focused care, an approach which values clients' perception of themselves and the world. The approaches to managing stressful perceptions of the situation, the dimensions of life experience, and the conceptualization of Like Everyone Else provide direction for nursing practice with people with schizophrenia living in the community.

STRESS AND COPING: FIRST-YEAR NEPALESE NURSING STUDENTS IN CLINICAL SETTINGS,Ganga Mahat,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12278486W,/authors/OL5367887A/Ganga_Mahat,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 125,"The purposes of this descriptive study were: (a) to identify stressful events of first-year Nepalese nursing students in the clinical setting, and (b) to determine how these students cope with the stressful events in the clinical setting.  The sample consisted of 104 students from four nursing campuses in Nepal. They were all full-time female students who had been in the clinical setting for 6-8 weeks. Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) students were excluded from the research study in order to have a homogenous sample.  The critical incident technique was utilized to identify students' stressful events. An open-ended question was the basis for gathering information about how students coped with their identified stressful events in the clinical setting.  Descriptions of stressful events reported on critical incident technique were classified into four categories: interpersonal relationships (negative interaction), initial experiences, feeling helpless, and demeaning experiences. The most frequently reported stressful event was interpersonal relationships (50%). The remaining stressful events identified by the students, in descending order, were: initial experiences (27.9%), feeling helpless (13.4%) and demeaning experiences (8.7%).  The statements used by the students when describing how they coped with the identified stressful events were selected and then classified into eight categories (types) of coping: problem solving, accepting responsibility, seeking social support, self-control, tension reduction, avoidance, wishful thinking and negative feelings. In all four categories of stressful events, the majority of students utilized the ""seeking social support"" category of coping. Overall, students used more emotion-focused types of coping than problem-focused types of coping.  Since the students experienced stress in the clinical setting, it suggests that nurse educators in Nepal need to take the initiative to identify students' stressful experiences, assist them to cope, and create a humanistic climate that supports the process of learning. A comfortable and supportive learning environment would offer students feelings of confidence, hope and increased self-esteem.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF THE NURSE'S PRESENCE,Fredricka Leigh Gilje,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278497W,/authors/OL5367898A/Fredricka_Leigh_Gilje,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 219,"The phenomenon of interest in this study is the nurse's presence, a nascent phenomenon of concern to nursing which had been identified as significant, but not fully described, in nursing literature. Sixteen patients over the age of eighteen years who were involved in inpatient and outpatient mental health programs of a rural midwestern hospital participated in the study. Guided by a modification of Parse's research methodology, this phenomenologically-based study generated a structure of meaning of the lived experience of the nurse's presence: The nurse's presence is experienced as enveloping comfort in the midst of discomfort that transcends time and space. Presence affirms worth as the nurse heeds the call from the other and invites connection through the wellspring of love and authentic being. In this experience the patient glimpses possibilities which are life-transforming. Interpreted through Parse's theory of human becoming practice methodology and Watson's theory of human care, this cocreated meaning reflects and further explicates true presence as a foundation for Parse's practice methodology as well as other practice approaches.  This investigation describes the meaningfulness of patients' experiences of human relating that are significant for nursing practice, yet not committed to language. Here, a new view of human relating is revealed. This view provides a contextual perspective of the aesthetics of human relating in the nurse-patient encounter which is holistic, rather than compartmentalized. Furthermore, it explicates that the nurse's presence surfaces from love and authentic being and is experienced as life transforming. This investigation supports that knowledge of the lived experience of the nurses' presence is foundational, preeminent, and central to caring and healing.  This study contributes to an understanding of caring processes and the art of nursing. It further explicates the phenomenon of presence from the perspective of Parse's theory of human becoming. Implications are offered for nursing theory development, research, practice, and education. Further direction related to inquiry is recommended.

The study examined the experienced caregiver burden and the relationships among objective and subjective burden, caregiver satisfaction, caregiver mastery, and the impact of caregiving. In addition, variables such as patient's diagnosis, caregiver's gender, and ethnic background were included in the analysis.  Terms defined were (a) severe mental illness, (b) family caregiver, (c) objective burden, (d) subjective burden, (e) caregiver satisfaction, (f) impact of caregiving, and (g) caregiver mastery.  Data collected with the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire were coded and entered into a computer file. Analysis was done with BMDP programs for descriptive statistics, canonical correlations, and univariate and multivariate analysis of the variables.  The findings of the study contribute toward a better understanding of caregiver experience and suggest programs that assist families to deal with the task-oriented and emotional aspects of caregiving. Some of the factors examined were ethnicity, diagnosis, gender, educational and financial status.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
THE PROCESS OF ESCALATING BEHAVIOR IN PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS,Kathleen Kirchner Mccann,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12278903W,/authors/OL5368249A/Kathleen_Kirchner_Mccann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 145,"Helping patients identify and manage highly disruptive and dangerously dysfunctional behavior is a major role of psychiatric nurses. In this study, such behavior was described as escalating behavior and was theoretically defined as behavior characterized by marked elevation in the individual's physical and psychological state, representing a change from his previous state of being, and of an intensity that threatened his ability to control the behavior. The purpose of the study was to describe the process of escalating behavior from the perspective of the psychiatric patient.  An exploratory field study design based on grounded theory methodology was used. The sample consisted of 20 informants, patients in inpatient psychiatric units. Data were collected by open-ended interview.  The substantive theory generated accounted for the process of escalating behavior and was described through four phases. During the Balancing phase the informants used familiar strategies to manage actively the challenges they were experiencing. During Tipping the Scales, the informants became aware of changes in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that were beyond their ability to manage. While Being Overpowered, the informants felt overtaken by powers beyond their control and no longer in charge of managing what was happening to them. While Reflecting, the informants reviewed their experience of escalating behavior, named the problems they encountered, identified more helpful interventions, and considered the consequences of the behavioral episode. The core variable, Perceived Environmental Failure, was described as the informants' perception that the resources needed to manage the experience were not available in the environment.  Based on the qualitative findings, the following conclusions were drawn: The phases of escalating behavior were influenced by intrapersonal and environmental factors. The informants perceived that they did not have the resources in the environment that they needed to manage the overwhelming challenges. The informants had difficulties with the development and maintenance of trusting relationships with staff and with trust in the safety, therapeutic value, and predictability of the environment. The informants identified out of control behavior as a later stage of a sequence of events that could have been interrupted and managed more effectively at earlier stages.

AN ATTRIBUTIONAL STUDY OF SECLUSION AND RESTRAINT OF PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS,Freida Hopkins Outlaw,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266990W,/authors/OL5358943A/Freida_Hopkins_Outlaw,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 123,"This study used a descriptive correlational design to examine attributions given by psychiatric patients and nurses about the restraint of the patient. A purposive sample of 84 patients and 84 nurses was used. Psychiatric patients who were restrained and the registered nurses who initiated the restraint, or who were in charge of the unit when the restraint occurred, were interviewed. Attribution theory, the study of the reasons people give for why events happen, was the theoretical framework used in this study.  An Attribution Interview Schedule, as well as patient, nurse, and situational demographic sheets, were used to collect the data. The data were analyzed using frequency distributions, chi square, and correlations. The results of the data analyses indicated that all nurses and most patients did think about why the patients were restrained although they did not agree about the causes for the restraint. This finding supported the attributional tenets proposed by Jones and Nisbett (1972) who described systematic differences in the causal attributions made by observers and actors. According to them, actors tend to attribute their behavior to situational factors while observers tend to make more dispositional attributions. Nurses stated unanimously that the causes for the patients' restraint were internal to the patient. They also tended to give responses that indicated that they thought the causes were controllable and unstable. The patients gave more varied responses. Nurse, patient, and situational variables were not related significantly to the causes given for the patients' restraint. However, there was a relationship between patients' previous admissions to a psychiatric hospital and the controllability dimension.  There was a significant finding between the nurse's past experience of being verbally or physically assaulted by a patient and the controllability dimension. This finding indicated that the more often the nurse had been assaulted, the more the nurse stated that the cause of the assault was due to uncontrollable factors in the patient.

"CAREGIVER BURDEN AND ADAPTATION IN MIDDLE-AGED DAUGHTERS OF DEPENDENT, ELDERLY PARENTS: A TEST OF ROY'S MODEL (CAREGIVER ADAPTATION)",Barbara Jean Adamjack Smith,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266943W,/authors/OL5358897A/Barbara_Jean_Adamjack_Smith,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 177,"The purpose of this study was to examine the adaptation of middle-aged daughters (40-60 years of age) to caregiving for a dependent, elderly parent. The Roy Adaptation Theory which is a holistic theory of nursing was the conceptual framework. Adaptation to caregiving was reflected in Roy's four modes of adaptation, namely: (1) physiological function, (2) self concept, (3) role, and (4) interdependence. The design was longitudinal, to detect change in caregiver burden and change in the modes of adaptation.  Caregiving was measured by the Caregiver Burden Interview. Physiological function was measured by the Brief Symptom Index. Self esteem was measured by the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale. Role was measured by a Semantic Differential. Interdependence was measured by the Empathic Tendency Questionnaire.  A convenience sample of 30 caregiver daughters to dependent, elderly parents was obtained through acute health care and community settings. The sample (N = 38) responded to the instruments at (T$sb1$); when caregiving responsibilities were assumed or increased and, (T$sb2$) six weeks later. Data were analyzed by t-test to measure change in burden and Pearson Product Moment Correlation to measure the relationship between change in caregiver burden and change in physiological function, self esteem, role and empathic tendency.  The respondents indicated that caregiving had been an on-going process which had begun, informally, sometime before participation in the study. Analysis of caregiver burden scores indicated a high moderate perception of burden that remained stable throughout the study. As a result, a relationship between change in caregiver burden and change in the four modes of adaptation could not be assessed. Measures of physiological dysfunction for the sample of caregivers were higher than established norms and remained high throughout the study. Measures of self concept and empathic tendency were high initially and remained high. Primary, secondary and tertiary role scores were positive and remained positive.  Nursing implications include the need for continued research on adaptation of middle-aged daughters to caregiving of elderly, dependent parents. A sample should be identified at the true onset of the caregiving process and extend over a longer period of time.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
EFFECT OF PERCEPTION OF SERIOUSNESS OF CHILDREN'S TONSILLECTOMY ON FAMILY ADAPTABILITY AND COHESION,Sandra E. Benter,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12266984W,/authors/OL5358937A/Sandra_E._Benter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 180,"The purpose of this study was to investigate one major factor, family perception of seriousness of a stressor event, which may be associated with changes in family adaptability and cohesion during a six week crisis period. The following questions were explored: What difference does the family's perception of the seriousness of a child's surgery have on the family's adaptability and cohesion prior to and six weeks following surgery? What difference does the family's level of stress have on its perception of the seriousness of surgery?.  This study utilized a pretest/post-test no control group design. Data were collected at the time of surgery scheduling and six weeks following surgery through mailed questionnaires from families attached to an otolaryngology outpatient clinic and five otolaryngologists' practices. Subjects consisted of 41 families in which a child underwent a tonsillectomy. Variables of interest were measured by the Rating Scale of Seriousness of Surgery, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales III (Olson, Portner, and Lavee, 1985), and the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes (McCubbin, Patterson and Wilson, 1982).  Fisher's exact tests were conducted on the number of families who either shifted or did not shift categories of cohesion and adaptability from pretest to post-test measurements. Analyses of covariance were conducted to compare high and low seriousness groups on cohesion, adaptability, and life stress scores with premeasures of each variable serving as the covariate.  Study findings did not consistently support predictions of the Family Crisis Model (Burr, 1973; Hill, 1949) and the Circumplex Model of Marital and Family Systems (Olson, Portner and Lavee, 1985). Significant findings resulted in the cohesion dimension. Families who were in the balanced categories of cohesion and who perceived their children's surgery to be serious significantly shifted to extreme categories six weeks after surgery. There was a significant difference in family cohesion scores between high and low seriousness groups. There were no significant findings for adaptability or stress.  This study provided some support for the Family Crisis and the Circumplex Models. It also supported the notion that the testing of middle range family theories can result in refinement of family theory and research.

FAMILY CAREGIVERS' LOG REPORTS OF SLEEP AND ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS OF PERSONS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,Patricia Ann O'Leary,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267533W,/authors/OL5359406A/Patricia_Ann_O'Leary,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 208,"The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep and activity behaviors of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as reported by the family caregiver during a 24-hour day. The conceptual framework was derived from the Roy adaptation model.  A convenience sample of 32 family caregivers was selected from a memory disorders clinic in a southeastern state. The family caregivers completed an investigator-developed sleep/activity behavior log for 2 days. Further information was obtained from the Index of Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist, and clinic records.  Narrative format and descriptive statistics were used to describe data obtained from the sleep/activity behavior log. Hypotheses were tested with paired t tests and correlations.  Persons with AD had a mean of 2.4 dependencies on the Index of Activities of Daily Living and a mean of 7.5 dependencies on the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. The mean number of behavior problems on the Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist was 13.2. There was a mean score of 11.3 on the Mini-Mental State Examination.  Adaptive behaviors occurred during approximately 75% of the day. The major adaptive behaviors between the hours of 8:01 AM-8:00 PM were relaxation behaviors. Adaptive sleep behaviors were mainly concentrated between the hours of 8:01 PM-8:00 AM.  The majority of ineffective behaviors occurred between the hours of 8:01 AM and 8:00 PM. Physical repetitive behaviors were the most common ineffective behaviors and accounted for 44% of the ineffective behaviors.  There was no statistically significant difference between day 1 and day 2 in the total number of behaviors, adaptive behaviors, or ineffective behaviors. A significant relationship was found between dependencies in ADL and mental status. There was a significant relationship between the number of current behavior problems and the number of ineffective behaviors related to sleep and activity in a 24-hour day.  The Roy adaptation model provided a useful framework for the purposes and methodology of the study. The log format is recommended for use in future research studies.

(1) To determine the effectiveness of a Structured Group Nursing Intervention (SGNI) to promote the adaptation of girls, ages 9-14 years who had been sexually abused, (2) to determine the utility of Roy's theory as a framework for viewing the problem of child sexual abuse from a nursing perspective, a structure within which to test the SGNI, and a means to predict clinical nursing intervention outcomes.  Research questions. (1) Is a SGNI effective in the promotion of adaptation of sexually abused girls ages 9-14 years, compared to sexually abused girls ages 9-14 years who receive agency treatment, and girls, 9-14 years from the community who have not been sexually abused and who do not receive treatment? (2) Are the psychosocial modes of Roy's theory of utility as an organizing framework, a structure within which to view child sexual abuse, and a means to predict nursing intervention outcomes?.  Design. Longitudinal, repeated measures, quasi-experimental, and triangulation in the self-concept mode.  Sample. 17 girls, sexually abused, who were randomly assigned to the SGNI, a control group of 13 girls, sexually abused, who received agency treatment, and a comparison group of 17 community girls, not sexually abused, who did not receive treatment. The SGNI was an eight week series of one hour per week group sessions for girls who had been sexually abused.  Instruments. Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985), a modified version of the UCLA Revised Loneliness (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980), Youth Self-Report (Achenbach, 1988), Child Mental Health Self Care Inventory (Gast, 1988), and Kinetic Family Drawing (Elin & Nucho, 1979).  Results. Research question one was not supported; there were no significant statistical differences among groups over time. There was tentative support for research question two; all groups tended to achieve scores indicating adaptation in the psychosocial modes, thus lending support for the Roy Adaptation Model.

UNCOVERING CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE IN EXPERT PSYCHIATRIC NURSING PRACTICE (NURSING),Ellen Crawford Mcelroy,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267924W,/authors/OL5359753A/Ellen_Crawford_Mcelroy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 181,"Psychiatric nursing has been defined as a specialty area of nursing which is fading away due to the failure of its members to develop a theoretical base for practice. Benner (1984) maintained there is knowledge embedded in expert practice which can be used for theory development. The purpose of this interpretive study was to uncover clinical knowledge embedded in the paradigm cases of expert psychiatric nurses. The conceptual framework for the study was based on nursing research conducted by Benner (1984), Benner and Tanner (1987), Tanner (1989), and a Skill Acquisition Model developed by Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1986). Heideggerian hermeneutics was the methodology which guided this research.  The sample consisted of 10 registered nurses, who had 5 or more years experience in a psychiatric setting and were identified as skilled clinicians by their peers. Paradigm cases obtained from the participants in unstructured interviews were audio-taped and transcribed to compose the texts for analysis. Analysis of data was based on the seven-stage process described in Diekelmann, Allen, and Tanner (1989). Because clinical knowledge emerged which was consistent with the competencies in all seven of Benner's Nursing Domains, another stage was added to the analysis to illustrate this relationship.  Three relational themes--Uncovering Danger in Psychiatric Nursing Practice, Acknowledging and Marking the Boundaries, and Reflection on Practice--emerged from the data. The major finding of the study was the constitutive pattern, the Primacy of the Nurse-Patient Relationship in Psychiatric Nursing Practice.  Recommendations for further research included the investigation of the decision-making process of nurses caring for patients experiencing danger to self or others, examination of the relationship of interpersonal boundaries to the termination phase of the nurse-patient relationship, and exploration of aspects of the nurse-patient relationship which emerged from this study: presence, trust, and reciprocity of caring. A suggestion which has implications for clinical practice was the use of small group forums for expert psychiatric nurses to exchange paradigm cases as a means of explicating and validating clinical knowledge developed through practice experience.

"THE RELATIONSHIP OF DAILY HASSLES, DEMANDS OF ILLNESS, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH PRIMARY LUNG CANCER",Paula Rae Klemm,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267501W,/authors/OL5359378A/Paula_Rae_Klemm,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 161,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in the United States. The five year survival rate is less than 13%, and most individuals will die within two years of diagnosis in spite of treatment with aggressive multimodality therapies. Alterations in family and marital roles, work status and social activities may occur abruptly and require rapid adjustments of the patient and family (Specht Ryan, 1987). The psychosocial and symptomological responses of patients to cancer in general have been extensively evaluated in the literature, but scant attention has been given to the identification of variables that might influence psychosocial adjustment in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Early identification of individuals at high risk to develop psychosocial adjustment problems is vital to the functioning of both the patient and his family. The literature suggests that daily hassles, demands of illness, and social support may help predict psychosocial adjustment in lung cancer patients, but these variables had never been combined in a single study before.  A sample of 56 individuals diagnosed with primary lung cancer between the ages of 31 and 78 completed the Daily Hassles Scale, Demands of Illness Inventory, Personal Resource Questionnaire, and Patient Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self Report. Multivariate analysis revealed that demands of illness (p =.0001) and race (p =.04) were the variables most predictive of psychosocial adjustment and together accounted for 59% of the variance in the sample population. The demographic variables of age, sex, marital status, stage of disease, Karnofsky score and diagnosis were not significantly associated with psychosocial adjustment. This suggests that nurses could utilize demands of illness to help identify individuals at high risk for developing psychosocial adjustment problems and then plan appropriate interventions.

THE ESSENCE OF NURSES' LIVED EXPERIENCE OF EMPATHY IN NURSE-PATIENT INTERACTIONS,Joyce Ann Swegle,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12267851W,/authors/OL5359688A/Joyce_Ann_Swegle,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 153,"The domain of this study was stated as: What is the essence of nurses' lived experience of empathy in a nurse-patient interaction? The purpose of the study was to identify the essential structure of empathy and to construct a framework of the lived experience of empathy from the perspective of the nurse empathizer in nurse-patient interactions. The study was conducted using a phenomenological orientation.  The purposive sample for the study consisted of five registered nurses who could identify an empathic nurse-patient interaction which they had participated in. The participants also demonstrated an ability and willingness to express themselves in the manner necessary for the study.  Interviews were used to obtain the participants' experiences of empathy in nurse-patient interactions. These descriptions were analyzed using Colaizzi's (1978) method. The study elicited the following essential structure of empathy: (1) Empathy is a passive and active process in which a nurse imaginatively assumes the role of an identified other. (2) An awareness of the imagined experience provides a framework for nursing intervention. (3) The nurse becomes involved with the patient and his family through repeated interactions. (4) Involvement is contingent upon the length of contact and realized through a mutual responsiveness between the nurse and identified other. (5) Alternative perceptions, decisions, and actions are interjected. (6) The nurse inspires hope in the patient and his family. (7) The nurse becomes cognizant after interaction with the patient or family member of his level of coping as well as her own. (8) Measures are taken to support and facilitate coping for all parties involved. (9) Barriers to empathy development are related to factors which decrease time for involvement and inadequate or ineffective coping skills. (10) Empathy is distinguished by the nurse's belief that her interventions made a difference for the patient.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCES ON MENTAL HEALTH TRIAGE DECISIONS (TRIAGE),Bruce Charles Schmidt,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12267979W,/authors/OL5359803A/Bruce_Charles_Schmidt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 304,"There are few multivariate models to explore emergency mental health triage decisions. To date, no models have been found that assess the effect of clinician concern for liability and the patient's reimbursement resources in concert with client and clinician characteristics on emergency psychiatric admission decisions.  This study explores institution-specific emergency mental health triage decisions for inpatient hospitalization or outpatient follow-up. Hypothesized influences on the disposition decision included: (a) the presence and type of the patient's health insurance; (b) patient demographics; (c) clinician characteristics, including sense of liability if the patient was not hospitalized; and (d) the clinical assessment of the patient.  The sample included 400 patients seen in a midwestern, urban not-for-profit hospital for emergency psychiatric and substance abuse and the clinicians performing the evaluation. Research tools were the patient's medical record, a survey of clinicians, the Global Assessment Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and two tools developed for this research: the Problem Rating Scale and the Legal Liability Scale. All tools demonstrated adequate reliability.  The clinician's sense of liability if the patient was discharged, the patient's clinical acuity and insurance status were used to correctly predict admission or discharge for 95% of the sample. Other significant predictors were danger to self or others, diagnosis and history of previous admissions; however these were subsumed by the previous three variables. The clinician's sense of liability was the single most important predictor of disposition and was only partially explained by clinical acuity. No relationship was found between disposition and age, ethnicity, marital or employment status, education, the evaluating clinician or time of evaluation.  The model was calculated using factor analysis, stepwise logistic regression and multiple nominal scale analysis. The derived model can be used to assess the relative impact of included variables as contingencies in the disposition decision and as a quality control tool to evaluate clinicians' decision-making and consistency.

A phenomenological method was designed and implemented. Twenty-two women who fit the criteria for this study were interviewed. The rights of the informants were protected. All of the women had been clinically depressed and were in the recovery stage as evidenced by their self evaluations and scores on the Beck Inventory. All of the women were able to articulate their lived experience of the phenomenon.  Data were generated using an unstructured, in depth, audio-tape recording of personal interviews. Informed consent for the taping and consent to contact their therapist, if necessary, were obtained prior to the interviews. The first interview was conducted over the phone to screen the volunteer informant to make certain she fulfilled the criteria for the study and to inform her about the study.  The focus of the interviews was on the phenomenological question concerning the meaning of the woman's experience of recovering from depression. The researcher's previous knowledge of the phenomenon was identified and bracketed prior to the interview and also during the analysis phase of the study. The data were analyzed using Spiegelberg's eight step protocol.  Scholarly Trustworthiness of this naturalistic study was maintained by leaving an audit trail to assure Validity, Truth value, Applicability, Consistency and Neutrality of the research study.  Five phases in the recovery process from depression were identified from analysis of the particulars in the data. The themes of these five phases were: Existential Alienation/Pain; Crises of Adulthood; First Turning Point; Second Turning Point; Becoming a Gardener.  The particulars/significant statements under each phase/theme were clustered and reduced to sub-themes. Sub-themes under phase one were, aloneness, abuse, and damaged self esteem. Sub-themes under phase two were, feelings and coping. Sub-themes under phase three were making connections and treatment experiences. Sub-themes under phase four were, becoming an agent and becoming a succorer. A sub-theme under phase five was cultivating the self.  This study provides insight for nurses into the phases a client goes through in the recovery process from depression. The nurse can use the client's perception of what was helpful and unhelpful and the tools they used to help themselves in recovering to give support, nurturance and care to enhance the recovery process for other depressed women.

The disease and its treatment pervade all aspects of life so it stands to reason that support from others might promote better health practices and outcomes.  Findings of previous studies of social support in diabetes represent a variety of designs and yield and mixed results. Consistent with the literature review, a model was developed with diabetes as a stressor and social support as a modifier of its effects. Gender-social support and stressor-social support interactions were at the heart of the model, which suggested two groups of hypotheses: (1) social support is associated with better home management behaviors, diabetes control, and affective state among diabetics and more so for women than men; (2) social support is associated with better home management behaviors, diabetes control, and affective state among diabetics and more so when the demands of the disease are greater.  A cross-sectional, correlational study was conducted. Data were collected from a convenience sample of 188 insulin-using diabetics in five study sites. The Demands of Diabetes Scale was developed for this study to quantify disease-related stressors. Diabetes-specific social support, general social support and depressive symptoms were measured using previously standardized instruments. Diabetes control was represented by hemoglobin A$sb□rm 1c □$values which reflect average blood glucose levels over 1-2 months prior to measurement.  While neither social support nor diabetes stressors were related to hemoglobin A$sb□rm 1c,□$ more frequent home monitoring behaviors were related to better diabetes control. Diabetes-specific support in interaction with diabetes stressors predicted monitoring behaviors, and general social support mitigated the depressive effects of disease-related stressors. No gender-social support interactions were significant.  Interpretation of findings is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data, but the analyses suggest that diabetes-specific support is associated with less frequent monitoring behaviors under some circumstances. General social support, however, had a direct negative effect on depressive symptoms.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"DAILY LIVES OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY (LIFE SATISFACTION, MEDICATION COMPLIANCE)",Fusae Kondo Abbott,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12274040W,/authors/OL5364415A/Fusae_Kondo_Abbott,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 274,"The purpose of this study is to describe the life course and the ordinary daily lives of persons with schizophrenia who are living successfully in the community. Data on daily living and life course were collected by semistructured interviews and clinical records review. In addition, two questionnaires were used: the Modified Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Life Skills Profile.  The sample consisted of 26 males and 16 females with a mean age of 37.1. The average community tenure since discharge from the last hospitalization was 3.9 years. The mean number of total hospitalizations was 7.0. A typical in this sample was never married, unemployed, on public assistance or entitlements, had no earned income, and lived under some kind of supervision.  Five different patterns of life course were identified. Factors related to community stabilization were medication compliance, cessation of street drug use, longer duration of contact with the mental health services, low-stress, supportive living environment including timely crisis intervention, stable living conditions. Also, subjects who were older and female had better stabilization in the community.  Ordinary daily lives were characterized by long periods of sleep and napping, short work time, extensive indoor activities, and long solitary activities: Although their lives appeared to be lone, non-productive, and passive, social interactions were key activities for the active parts of their lives. The daily activities seemed to be influenced by living arrangements.  All subjects mentioned some strategies to manage their symptoms in their daily lives. However, no symptom specific strategies emerged from this analysis. Medication was the most frequently mentioned strategy. Besides medication, strategies which were reported by subjects were ""talking to someone,"" ""sleep and rest,"" ""keeping busy,"" ""listening to music or watching TV,"" ""a friendly atmosphere,"" and ""exercise or walking."".  Subjects' most satisfied areas of daily livings were household work, relationship with friends, and services and the least satisfied areas were sexual life and financial condition.

THE EXPERIENCES OF SEVEN NURSES WHO RELATE WITH VIOLENCE-PRONE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS,Joanna Landau,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12274037W,/authors/OL5364411A/Joanna_Landau,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 167,"This is a qualitative interview study of the experiences of nurses working with violence-prone psychiatric inpatients. There were seven participants, five women and two men, with from 4 to 26 years of experience. The setting was a 36-bed inpatient unit in a county health center.  The participants all reported that they were not adequately prepared before beginning their responsibilities with violence-prone psychiatric inpatients. They felt they had become knowledgeable primarily through their own experiences with violence-prone patients, including the experience of being assaulted and, to a lesser extent, by attending in-service training programs. They used what they had learned to respond to patients' violence-prone behavior. Within the context of the therapeutic relationship, they stressed the importance of observation, talking, listening, and only when they felt it necessary used medications and/or restraint or seclusion.  All the nurses in this study expressed the belief that some violence was both unpredictable and unpreventable. They also expressed a mental association of violence with men, rather than with women, even if that contrasted with their own experiences. Finally, the participants reported having strong feelings about the presence of some unsuitable staff who failed to recognize that patients are people, too.  Recommendations for practice suggested by the findings include education about violence-prone patients in basic nursing education curricula, workplace orientation programs, and ongoing in-service education. Continuing supervision and support for nurses is also recommended.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
MANAGING UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR: THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (CAREGIVING),Gloria Jean Kuhlman,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12274042W,/authors/OL5364417A/Gloria_Jean_Kuhlman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 148,"The purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual framework that explains how institutional caregivers deal with the complex and unpredictable problems associated with caring for a patient with a progressive dementia like Alzheimer's disease in the context of a nursing home setting.  Professional caregivers (n = 30) ranging in age from 28 to 56 participated in the study. Data were obtained over an eight week period through a demographic questionnaire, one face-to-face taped interview, and observations of caregiving techniques with each subject. Questions addressed how the caregiver defines the need for care, the properties and characteristics of caregiving problems, caregiver activities associated with care, the strategies used by caregivers to manage care, factors influencing the caregiver's ability to manage care, and the consequences of care for the AD patient and the caregiver. Grounded theory was the qualitative method used for this study.  Findings revealed a Basic Social Process identified as ""managing unpredictable behavior"". This process is used by institutional caregivers to guide activities with an AD patient. As the disease progresses, AD patients become unable to verbally communicate their needs or at times even recognize they have a need. The caregiver must assess the patient's behaviors and develop strategies that provide for the patient's nutrition, elimination, and hygiene while keeping in mind the overriding need for patient safety and dignity.  This study addresses caregiving strategies used on one nursing unit specializing in care for patients with AD. Balancing safety and dignity emerged as the indicator of quality of care in this study of AD institutional caregiving.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
SELF-EFFICACY AND COMPLIANCE IN PSYCHIATRIC OUTPATIENTS,Sue Main,mental_health,First published in 1990,/works/OL12268697W,/authors/OL5360374A/Sue_Main,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 290,"The purpose of this prospective study was to determine if self-efficacy and outcome expectation would predict health behavior, attendance, and dropout of young chronic clients in psychiatric day treatment. Subjects were 43 men and 37 women who were an average of 31 years of age, who had prolonged psychiatric disorders, and who were participating in psychiatric disorders, and who were participating in psychiatric day treatment. Of these subjects, 28% had a secondary diagnosis of drug and/or alcohol abuse. Data were collected, using structured interviews and staff ratings, at three times (on admission, at 2 months, and at 3 months after admission). Instruments with multiple items were found to have adequate internal consistency reliability.  General self-efficacy, specific self-efficacy, and outcome expectation for five health behaviors were used to predict the frequency of each of the five health behaviors (coping, monitoring, treatment participation, assertiveness, and medication management), attendance in day treatment, and dropout from day treatment. Bandura's self-efficacy model was the theoretical basis for exploring relationships between health beliefs and health behavior. Relationships were explored using Pearson correlations, multiple regression, and discriminant analysis.  Bandura's model was supported for only one of the five health behaviors, medication management. Self-efficacy and outcome expectation for medication management at 2 months and general self-efficacy on admission predicted medication management at 2 months, F = 3.23, p $<$.05. Health beliefs at 2 months for the other four health behaviors and health beliefs on admission, however, failed to significantly predict health behaviors, attendance, and dropout. The strongest predictors of attendance and dropout were staff ratings of subjects' satisfaction and progress with treatment at 2 months after admission. Significant (p $<$.05) predictors of health behaviors at 2 months were staff ratings of subjects' satisfaction and progress in treatment at 2 months, functional level, and level of health behavior on admission.  As a group dropouts (n = 20) had significantly lower admission health behavior ratings and satisfaction ratings when compared with admission health behavior and satisfaction of other subjects. Dropouts also demonstrated a significant decrease in outcome expectation for participation from admission to 2-month follow-up scores. It was recommended that further study of compliance in this population include additional variables of specific skill level for the health behaviors, factors that reinforce and block performance of health behavior, and beliefs about current need and importance of attendance at treatment.

"THE EXPERIENCE OF LONELINESS IN ADULT, HOSPITALIZED, DYING PERSONS",Margaret Vettese Zack,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268548W,/authors/OL5360250A/Margaret_Vettese_Zack,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 312,"The purpose of this descriptive field study was to investigate the meaning of loneliness from the adult, hospitalized, dying person's perspective. Participant observation, intensive interviewing, and review of records were the central techniques of data collection. Data were collected over a nine-month period, with the researcher in the role of a clinical nurse specialist at a large university medical center.  The purposive sample consisted of 18 primary participants who were recognized as having limited life spans by virtue of their diagnosis of metastatic cancer or AIDS and a prognosis of approximately one year or less. The interpretation of loneliness meanings relied on data from these primary participants. Field notes comprised the data for analysis. A thematic and pattern analysis was performed.  The data supported the existence of three meaning dimensions of loneliness: relational, existential, and emotional. These dimensions overlap and a common core of experiences, termed ""poverty of self,"" was identified. The meaning dimensions are expressive of and based in two affiliative contexts, others and self.  From the perspective of the adult, hospitalized, dying person, loneliness is an unpleasant feeling of separateness, aloneness, and/or emptiness in response to qualitative or quantitative deficits in relationships with others and a perceived inability to adequately express one's complete self with others. The data also revealed that a person may feel lonely in the presence of others or he/she may be alone and not feel lonely. The intensity of the feeling may be lessened by the knowledge that the separation from important persons or things is temporary. From the dying person' s perspective, although it is a frightening and distressing experience, there is potential for self-growth.  A comparison of data from the lonely and not lonely suggested three associated conditions: (a) deficits in relationships that provide a sense of attachment and the opportunity for nurturance; (b) the absence of a spiritual belief system; and (c) a pattern of living-dying characterized by fear and uncertainty about illness and/or treatment outcomes.  The majority of these dying persons expressed at least a minimal or temporary experience of loneliness. The potential usefulness of nursing interventions aimed at self-enrichment were suggested.

AN ADAPTATION MODEL FOR WOMEN WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS,Nancy Jones Crigger,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12278184W,/authors/OL5367609A/Nancy_Jones_Crigger,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 126,"A conceptual model of adaptation based on the Cognitive Theory of Stress and Coping was tested through path analysis in a convenience sample of 90 women with chronic, stable multiple sclerosis (MS). Model variables, representing concepts within the theory, were derived from the literature and confirmed by four women with MS. These variables included disease disability, social support, uncertainty, spiritual well-being, self-esteem, and mastery, with mastery representing the degree of successful adaptation. Six instruments were used to measure the variables: Expanded Disability Status Scale, Perceived Social Support Inventory, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness--Community, Spiritual Well-Being Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Mastery Scale.  Although the conceptual model accounted for 26% of the variance in mastery, it statistically failed to fit the data. Data from the model testing were used to form a reconceptualized model, which, when tested, accounted for 41% of the variance in mastery. The reconceptualized model approached but also failed to fit the data statistically.  In the reconceptualized model, disease disability had a negative effect on uncertainty. Social support negatively affected uncertainty and positively affected self-esteem and mastery. Spiritual well-being had a negative effect on uncertainty and a positive effect on social support and mastery. Self-esteem positively affected mastery. The incidences of life stresses other than disease disability had a negative effect on mastery. Spiritual well-being was found to have the greatest total positive effect on mastery when all the model variables were tested for direct and indirect effects.  The importance of conceptualizing adaptation in women with stable MS as a holistic process was shown by the findings. With further refinement the reconceptualized model offers promise as one causal explanation of adaptation in women with chronic, stable MS.

"EFFECTS OF MULTIFAMILY GROUP TREATMENT ON RELATIVES OF DEPRESSED PATIENTS (FAMILY BURDEN, COPING, ROLE PERFORMANCE)",Sharon Jean Trimborn,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12278271W,/authors/OL5367686A/Sharon_Jean_Trimborn,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 223,"A descriptive, comparison group design with repeated measures was used to test multifamily group treatment effects on family members' perceived uncertainty, problem-focused coping, and family burden and on depressed patients' rehospitalization and role performance. Additionally, a model was tested which depicted relationships among perceived uncertainty, problem-focused coping, family burden, patients' rehospitalization, and role performance.  Fifty relatives of hospitalized, depressed patients (n = 48) or of depressed patients directly admitted to a daytreatment program (n = 2) constituted the convenience sample. Multifamily treatment and non-family focused groups received comparable types of treatment after hospital discharge or entry into the day treatment program with the exception of multifamily group treatment as planned.  Data were collected during two interviews. The first interview was completed immediately prior to patients' discharge from the hospital or immediately upon entry into the daytreatment program. The second interview occurred approximately four months later. The following measurements were used: Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (administered at pre-test only), the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, the revised Ways of Coping Checklist, and the Social Behavioral Assessment Schedule (all administered during both interviews).  Multifamily group treatment was not found to be more effective than non-family focused care. Severity of depression scores for patients in both groups were comparable.  Findings did not support the model. Perceived uncertainty was a poor predictor of problem-focused coping. Neither problem-focused coping approaches nor subjective and objective burden functioned as mediating variables of perceived uncertainty on the outcome measures of rehospitalization or role performance.  Further evaluation of the effects of multifamily group treatment is warranted. Recommendations include use of a qualitative approach to determine the efficacy of the treatment mode and further study of predictors and mediators of family burden.

A phenomenological methodology and data analysis procedure developed by Morse (1980) were used. The research setting was a hospital in the Southwestern United States. A purposive sampling technique was used to select the twelve participants in the sample. Two instruments, a demographic data form and loneliness interview, were used for data collection. Major components of loneliness experiences were identified from data analysis. Descriptions of loneliness experiences were analyzed for common patterns and generalities. Findings included the construction of a definition of loneliness, the behavioral responses employed to alleviate loneliness, and the discovery that the majority of the participants were lonely. The results supported the literature description of loneliness and provided information for further delineation of an assessment tool. A loneliness model was constructed for explanation of this phenomenon and as an initial step for future theory development.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
QUALITY OF LIFE IN POST-MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WOMEN (MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION),Suzanne Joyce Wingate,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273130W,/authors/OL5363630A/Suzanne_Joyce_Wingate,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 182,"The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of environmental inputs (age, employment status, severity of illness, length of illness, marital status, socioeconomic status) and psychological mediators (social support, control over health, self-esteem) to the adaptive outcome of quality of life (QOL) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) women.  An ex post facto, one-group, cross-sectional, correlational design was used. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 96 subjects from cardiologists' offices. Selection criteria were (a) female, (b) diagnosis of MI, and (c) had not undergone cardiac surgery. The subjects completed 6 instruments: (a) Quality of Life Index, (b) Social Support Questionnaire (Satisfaction), (c) Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scales (Powerful Others), (d) Self-Esteem Inventory, (e) Additional Information Sheet, and (f) Patient Data Sheet. The Hollingshead Index measured socioeconomic status and Ejection Fraction measured severity of illness.  Regression-based path analysis was used. The findings were (a) employment status (p =.0002), social support (p =.0001), and self-esteem (p =.04) were significant predictors of QOL; (b) the environmental variables and mediating variables accounted for 47.8% of the variance in QOL ($Rsp2$ =.478, F = 8.76, p $<$.0001); (c) social support (p =.0001) and control over health (p =.01) were significant predictors of self-esteem; (d) the environmental variables, social support, and control over health accounted for 23.5% of the total variance in self-esteem ($Rsp2$ =.235, F = 3.34, p =.002); (e) there were 11 overall qualitative themes related to QOL, with the most frequent themes being health/illness, activity, and relationships/support.  The conclusions were (a) post-MI women who had returned to work or had already retired and who had higher levels of social support and self-esteem had higher levels of QOL; (b) the environmental variables and mediating variables explained almost half of the variance in the QOL of post-MI women; (c) post-MI women with higher levels of social support and lower levels of external control over health had higher levels of self-esteem; (d) age, employment status, length of illness, severity of illness, marital status, socioeconomic status, social support, and control over health explained almost one-fourth of the variance in the self-esteem of post-MI women.

EFFECTS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AND HEALTH LOCUS-OF-CONTROL ON ANXIETY IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENTS: NURSING IMPLICATIONS,Shu-Lian Sheila Sheu,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272925W,/authors/OL5363456A/Shu-Lian_Sheila_Sheu,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 251,"The major purposes of this cross sectional study were to investigate the mediating and interactive mediating effects of received social support and various dimensions of health locus of control on the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety. The sample consisted of 67 subjects who had experienced a first-time myocardial infarction within the past three to six weeks. The data were collected using Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y - I, Barrera's Inventory of Socially Supportive Behavior and Wallston's Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.  A significant positive relationship between received social support and internal health locus of control was found when the sample was analyzed as a whole. When subgroup analyses were performed, a mediating effect of received social support was found for the subjects with higher socioeconomic status and higher educational background but not for those with lower socioeconomic or educational status. This indicates that received social support was beneficial for those under high stress, but did not seem to make difference for those under low stress. Further analyses showed that high internal health locus of control (IHLC) was favorable for males with low stress, but not for those with high stress. Powerful others health locus of control (PHLC) has an interactive mediating effect with received social support for the older subjects, but not the younger ones.  When the types of received social support were tested for mediating and interactive mediating effects, it was found that social interaction and chance health locus of control (CHLC) and tangible support and PHLC each had an interactive mediating effect on the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety.  These findings suggest that there is a relationship between received social support and internal health locus of control (IHLC), but the role of IHLC may be different for males than for females. Furthermore, older persons with low PHLC may be better able to use received social support. Those with low PHLC may benefit most from tangible support while those with high CHLC may benefit most from the social interaction type of support in high stress situations.  Finally, the data from this study suggest that an interactive model might be better to understand the relationships between stressor, stress, and anxiety than a simple model.

HEALTH-SEEKING RESOURCES AND ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING IN DEPRESSED AND NONDEPRESSED ADULTS,Jaclene Annette Zauszniewski,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273442W,/authors/OL5363912A/Jaclene_Annette_Zauszniewski,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 168,"Depression continues to be a significant clinical problem presented to psychiatric-mental health nurses. Nursing interventions enhancing health-seeking resources in depressed clients would be particularly useful in assisting them toward more productive, healthy lifestyles. However, development of such interventions should be based on the establishment of significant relationships among health-seeking resources, intervening factors, and adaptive functioning. This study examined social interest and learned resourcefulness as health-seeking resources and their relationship to depressive symptoms, negative personal beliefs (worthlessness, powerlessness, hopelessness), and adaptive functioning in 63 depressed inpatients and 63 nondepressed individuals living in the community.  Schlotfeldt's health-seeking model provided the guiding theoretical framework for examining relationships among the variables of interest. A comparative survey design was used to contrast depressed and nondepressed adults on social interest, learned resourcefulness, negative personal beliefs, depressive symptoms, and adaptive functioning. Statistical analyses included correlations, multiple regression, and multivariate analysis of variance. Five instruments were administered: Social Interest Scale, Self-Control Schedule, Beck Depression Inventory, Cognitive Triad Index, and Community Living Skills Scale. Demographic data were collected to describe the depressed and nondepressed groups.  Findings indicated the two groups were significantly different on all measures except social interest. For both groups, higher scores on instruments measuring health-seeking resources were correlated with lower scores on negative personal beliefs and depressive symptoms and higher scores on adaptive functioning. For both groups, worthlessness emerged as a significant predictor of depressive symptoms while powerlessness and hopelessness did not. Absence of depressive symptoms emerged as a significant predictor of adaptive functioning for nondepressed persons. Learned resourcefulness emerged as a significant predictor of adaptive functioning in the depressed group.  Depressed subjects scoring high in learned resourcefulness and high in worthlessness, powerlessness, or hopelessness had higher adaptive functioning scores than those low in learned resourcefulness. Nondepressed subjects scoring high in learned resourcefulness and high in hopelessness had higher adaptive functioning scores than those with low learned resourcefulness scores. Study results support Schlotfeldt's health-seeking model. This study yields information important for the development of future psychiatric nursing interventions with depressed adults.

The experimental treatment was a board game, General Hospital, designed for pre-operative teaching of school age children. Experimental group A played the game with the nurse. Experimental group B played with their parent with minimal assistance from the nurse. The control group did not play the game. All groups received routine nursing care of the institution.  Anxiety in the children was measured by scoring preoperative and posthospital drawings of ""a person"" obtained from each subject. In addition, the children's preadmission stress level was assessed and the Post-Hospital Behavior Questionnaire was completed by the parent. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure parents' preoperative and posthospital anxiety.  Repeated measures analysis of variance and analysis of covariance revealed that posthospital anxiety was not significantly reduced as a result of preoperative structured play in school age children and their parents. Children who played with their parents had significantly higher posthospital scores than preoperative scores. These children's posthospital anxiety scores were significantly higher than scores of the other children. Factors found to be related to the anxiety levels of the children and their parents were age, grade, no previous surgery, income level, and years of education of the father.

However, no studies on this topic have been reported in the literature.  The purpose of this study was to focus on the self-care actions of chronic schizophrenics and specifically answer: (a) What are the self-care actions of chronic schizophrenics associated with meeting solitude and social interaction requisites, and (b) Are chronic schizophrenic clients' reported self-care actions congruent with Orem's (1985) sets of actions for maintenance of a balance between solitude and social interaction? This objective was accomplished through interviewing 10 chronic schizophrenics located in inpatient treatment settings, transcribing the interview tapes, analyzing the content of the interviews, establishing lists of solitude and social interaction self-care actions, and analyzing the solitude and social interaction self-care actions for congruence with Orem's sets of actions for maintenance of a balance between solitude and social interaction.  Analysis of the data revealed 18 self-care actions associated with meeting solitude requisites and 10 self-care actions associated with meeting social interaction requisites. The solitude self-care actions clustered around two distinct categories: distancing and organizing. One social interaction category was apparent to the researcher: managing situations. Analysis of the self-care actions for congruence with Orem's (1985) sets of actions for maintenance of a balance between solitude and social interaction revealed that 2 of 18 solitude self-care actions were congruent and all 10 of the social interaction self-care actions were congruent.  It was recommended that the present study be replicated with chronic schizophrenic clients across the lifespan who are located in inpatient treatment settings, residential treatment settings, and independent living sites. Further, additional research to isolate conditions that are related to Orem's (1985) sets of actions for maintenance of a balance between solitude and social interaction also was recommended.

COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS,John R. Devendorf,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266475W,/authors/OL5358506A/John_R._Devendorf,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 568,"Whether schizophrenia is one or many mental disorders has been debated since 1896 when Kraepelin first organized several previously distinct disorders into a single diagnostic category. The acceptance of Kraepelin's work led to a shift in the debate from whether or not schizophrenia was a single disorder to what was the nature of schizophrenia. Some subsequent researchers, following Kraepelin, concluded that deficits in the physiological processes of sensation produced an arrest of development and led to schizophrenic patients' misperceptions of reality. Others, following Bleuler (1911) argued that disturbances in the psychological processes of association produced abnormal thinking which led to the schizophrenic patients' misperceptions.  Piaget (1923) provided a framework for resolving the controversy over the nature of schizophrenia. He observed that the thinking of schizophrenic patients was not abnormal but was arrested at a lower, child-like level of development. The work begun by Kraepelin, Bleuler, and Piaget was expanded in the study into a cognitive-perceptual model to illustrate how both sensation and association are involved in schizophrenic reactions.  The results of applying the cognitive-perceptual model to the symptoms of schizophrenic patients indicate that a disturbance in the physiological processing of sensation occurs at onset. This physiological deficit blocks further learning and the development of more mature cognitive levels. The age at which learning and cognitive development are stopped is determined by the patient's age at onset. Those having earlier onset would have less developed cognitive structures, while later onset patients have more advanced abilities. Neurotic subjects were not expected to have the learning block which produces the arrest of cognitive development.  The cognitive arrest portion of the model was tested empirically by administering Piaget-type tasks to neurotic and earlier and later onset schizophrenic patients. The results supported the predictions derived from the model. The schizophrenic group had lower cognitive levels compared to the neurotic subjects. Furthermore, the earlier onset schizophrenic subjects scored lower on the cognitive development scale than later onset subjects. These results suggested that assessment of cognitive level would be useful for selecting appropriate treatment strategies for schizophrenic patients.

Miller's (1983, 1992) Model of Patient Power Resources served as the conceptual framework from which a middle-range theory of Homelessness-Hopelessness was derived to guide the study.  The sample consisted of 40 homeless veterans from the Homeless Evaluation Unit (HEU) Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center at Mountain Home Tennessee. The subjects completed pretests on admission, were randomly assigned to the treatment or waiting control group and completed posttests at the end of four weeks of either specialized nursing intervention treatment or the usual and customary treatment in the HEU. Data were collected with the Miller Hope Scale (Miller & Powers, 1988), the General Self-Efficacy Subscale (Sherer, Maddox, Mercandante, Prentice, Dunn, Jacobs, & Rogers, 1982), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965) and the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979).  Major findings included a significant inverse relationship between length of homelessness and level of hope and a positive relationship with depression on admission to the study. There was support for the Homelessness-Hopelessness theory evidenced by a high level of depression and low levels of hope, self-efficacy and self-esteem among these homeless veterans. Further support for the theory was seen in the increased level of hope and self-esteem and decreased depression in veterans who received the nursing intervention. Treatment and control groups differed significantly with regard to hope at posttest. Implications for the nursing profession, public policy and future research were discussed.

During the 1980s and 1990s, tens of thousands of Americans became convinced that they had repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse, and then, decades later, recovered those memories in therapy. Maran was one of them. Her accusation and estrangement from her father divided her family into those who believed her and those who didn't, and led her to isolate herself among ""survivors"" who devoted their lives, and life savings, to recovering memories of events that had never occurred. Exploring the psychological, cultural, and neuroscientific causes of this modern American witch-hunt, Maran asks how so many people could come to believe the same lie at the same time? And perhaps more importantly: what are the ""big lies"" gaining traction in American culture today--and how can we keep them from taking hold?--From publisher description.

"EFFECTS OF INITIAL STRESS LEVEL, SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND PARTICIPATION IN AN EXERCISE OR MUSIC CONDITION ON THE POSTTREATMENT STRESS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY OF NURSES",Martha Welch Taylor,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12273198W,/authors/OL5363691A/Martha_Welch_Taylor,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 338,"The present study investigated the main and interactive effects of initial stress level, level of social support satisfaction, and participation in either an exercise, music, or waiting-list condition on the posttreatment stress, depression, and anxiety scores of nurses. Subjects were 102 female nurses stratified on the basis of their regular exercise pattern and then randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: exercise (n = 35), music (n = 34), or waiting-list (n = 33). For 20 minutes thrice weekly, exercisers participated in an aerobic exercise of their choice and music subjects listened to music self-selected as stress reducing. Waiting-list subjects agreed to maintain their normal exercise and stress-reduction activities during the 6 week treatment period. All subjects completed self-report measures before and after the treatment period regarding trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), and social support satisfaction (Social Support Questionnaire-Satisfaction Scale).  Three-way analysis of covariance procedures were employed to determine the main and interactive effects of treatment, social support satisfaction, and initial stress level on posttreatment stress, depression, and anxiety, using the pretest scores on those dependent variables as covariates. Results indicated that (a) exercise and music-listening exhibited a significant main effect on subjects' posttreatment stress level, and (b) level of social support satisfaction exhibited a significant main effect on posttreatment levels of depression and stress. No significant interaction effect was observed for any of the dependent variables and no significant main effect for initial stress level on depression or anxiety was obtained.  Although causal conclusions are not warranted, these results suggest that exercise, music, and social support may reduce stress among female nurses. The findings also suggest that social support warrants further investigation as a possible method of alleviating or preventing depression among female nurses.

ROLE CONFLICT AND ROLE AMBIGUITY AS PREDICTORS OF BURNOUT AMONG HOSPICE NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS (STRESS),Ina Sue Boyd,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280733W,/authors/OL5369860A/Ina_Sue_Boyd,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 123,"The purpose of this study was to analyze whether perceived role ambiguity and role conflict are useful as predictors of burnout among hospice nurses and hospice social workers.  Subjects in this study were nurses and social workers (counselors) employed by hospices which were members of the National Hospice Organization and which were licensed by their respective states. The sample included 162 nurses and 72 social workers for a total sample size of 234. Survey packets were distributed to the subjects by their respective hospices since data does not exist which would allow subjects working for hospices to be contacted individually. The survey packets included a (a) letter of introduction and instruction, (b) demographic inventory, (c) Maslach Burnout Inventory, (d) Role Questionnaire to measure perceived role ambiguity and role conflict, and an (e) addressed, stamped return envelope. The study was designed to ensure respondent anonymity.  Results were analyzed using analyses of variance and stepwise regression. The three subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (a) Emotional Exhaustion, (b) Depersonalization, and (c) Personal Accomplishment were used as dependent variables. There were significant relationships between role conflict and between role ambiguity and each of the three subscales. Role conflict and role ambiguity influenced each subscale in opposite directions: (a) as role conflict went up, Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization went down; (b) as role ambiguity went up, Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization went up; (c) as role conflict went up Personal Accomplishment (reversed) went up; and (d) as role ambiguity went up Personal Accomplishment (reversed) went down. There were no significant findings based on subject gender, race, age, years worked. Data did indicate that subjects in the study were experiencing moderate levels of burnout.  It was concluded that role ambiguity and role conflict do contribute at a significant level to burnout for hospice nurses and social workers, but do not serve as strong predictor factors. Recommendations for addressing role ambiguity and role conflict for hospice nurses and social workers and recommendations for further study were provided.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ATTITUDES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TOWARD THE MENTALLY ILL AND ELDERLY AND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE DEGREE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL NURSING HOME REFORM ACT OF 1987,Barbara Smith Dorsett,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279198W,/authors/OL5368479A/Barbara_Smith_Dorsett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 220,"A review of the literature indicated that negative attitudes of mental health professionals toward the mentally ill and elderly were continuous barriers in the mental health system. Sufficient research had not been conducted to determine if there was a relationship between the attitudes of mental health professionals toward the mentally ill and elderly, and the degree of implementation of the federal nursing home preadmission screening and annual resident review (PASARR) program.  This study was undertaken to examine the relationships between the attitudes of mental health PASARR evaluators in the state of Michigan and the degree of implementation of PASARR with the mentally ill elderly. The four variables associated with program implementation included workload, communication practices, effectiveness, and innovation.  The researcher combined six effectual instruments to meet the needs of this study, along with a set of demographic questions. The combined instrument was administered to mental health professionals responsible for the provision of PASARR in 30 Michigan county boards participating in the study.  Five hypotheses were tested by using the Pearson product moment correlation test of significance and a sixth hypothesis was tested by using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test of significance followed by univariate F's.  Conclusions were drawn from the findings and past research as follows: (1) Attitudes toward the mentally ill will be significantly related to attitudes toward the elderly, as perceived by mental health PASARR evaluators. (2) Worker communication practices will be significantly related to attitudes toward the mentally ill and elderly, as perceived by mental health PASARR evaluators.

"THE USE OF AN IN-HOUSE DAY CARE PROGRAM TO TREAT THE COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS OF DEMENTED NURSING HOME RESIDENTS (COGNITIVE DEFICITS, AFFECTIVE DEFICITS)",Michael Anthony Protomastro,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268200W,/authors/OL5359974A/Michael_Anthony_Protomastro,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 209,"An investigation was made of the effectiveness of an in-house, day care program in treating the cognitive, affective, and behavioral deficits of demented nursing home residents. It was predicted that such a treatment would benefit the subjects in terms of orientation, agitation, negative affect, withdrawn behavior, manageability, and self-care. Forty-eight demented residents of a nursing home were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The day care program, which lasted six months, consisted of six hours daily of coordinated group activities, Monday through Friday, and two hours on Sunday. The groups used methods which sought to provide physical, sensory, and cognitive stimulation; encourage association, reminiscence, and recall; provide an opportunity for the communication of thoughts and feeling; promote socialization; increase reality orientation. Assessments by the primary caregivers were made before the inception of the day care program, after its termination, and one month later. Statistical analyses revealed that both groups had significantly deteriorated in almost all outcome measures, but showed no treatment effect. The interrelationships found among the dependent variables are presented, as are the evidence of a shift effect and the interrated reliability achieved. The significance of the findings is discussed, along with implications and suggestions for future research and for practice. Whether or not the absence of significant treatment effects indicates that the treatment is of no value is considered.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Much of the content reflects both differences from and relationships with the dominant Western theories and practices so often unsuccessfully applied with these groups. The contributors represent both experienced researchers and practitioners and address topics such as research examining traditional and emerging Pasifika identities; contemporary research and practice in working with Pasifika youth and adolescents; culturally-appropriate approaches for working with Pasifika adults; and practices in supervision that have been developed by Maori and Pasifika practitioners. Chapters include practice scenarios, research reports, analyses of topical issues, and discussions about the appropriateness of applying Western theory in other cultural contexts. As Pasifika cultures are still primarily oral cultures, the works of several leading Maori and Pasifika poets that give voice to the changing identities and contemporary challenges within Pacific communities are also included""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For centuries, doctors have struggled to define mental illness--how do you diagnose it, how do you treat it, how do you even know what it is? In search of an answer, in the 1970s a Stanford psychologist named David Rosenhan and seven other people--sane, normal, well-adjusted members of society--went undercover into asylums around America to test the legitimacy of psychiatry's labels. Forced to remain inside until they'd ""proven"" themselves sane, all eight emerged with alarming diagnoses and even more troubling stories of their treatment. Rosenhan's watershed study broke open the field of psychiatry, hastening the closing of institutions and changing mental health diagnosis forever.  But, as Cahalan's explosive new research shows, very little in this saga is exactly as it seems. What really happened behind those closed asylum doors, and what does it mean for our understanding of mental illness today?  ""Breathtaking! Cahalan's brilliant, timely, and important book reshaped my understanding of mental health, psychiatric hospitals, and the history of scientific research. A must-read for anyone who's ever been to therapy, taken a brain-altering drug, or wondered why mental patients were released in droves in the 1980s. And a thrilling, eye-opening read even for those who thought they weren't affected by the psychiatric world.""    --ADA CALHOUN, author of St. Marks Is Dead and Wedding Toasts I'll Never Give  This description comes from the publisher.

But Stephen Hinshaw would have never thought that in his family a profound secret had been kept under lock and key for 18 years. From the moment his father revealed his long history with mental illness and involuntary hospitalizations, Hinshaw knew his life would be changed forever. Hinshaw calls his father's reveal ""psychological birth""--after years of experiencing the ups and downs of his father's illness without knowing it existed, watching him disappear for weeks at a time only to return as the loving father he had always known, everything he experienced as a child began to make sense. He learned as much as possible about his father's illness, and what began as an exploration into his father's past and mental health turned into a full-fledged career as a clinical psychologist. In Another Kind of Madness, Hinshaw explores the burden of living in a family ""loaded"" with mental illness and debunks the ""stigma"" behind it, explaining that in today's society, mental health problems can result in a loss of a driver's license, inability to vote or run for office, ineligibility for jury service, or automatic relinquishment of child custody. With a moving personal narrative and shocking facts about how America views mental health conditions in the 21st century, Another Kind of Madness is a passionate call to arms regarding the importance of destigmatizing mental illness""--   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Working our way to better mental health,Great Britain.

It blights lives, traps people in poverty and prevents the country harnessing the talents and potential of hundreds of thousands of people. Mental ill-health is now the most common reason for claiming health-related benefits and 86 per cent remain on the benefits for more than three months. But as well as having a major impact on individuals and their families, the cost of poor mental health to the country is also very high. A recent review of the health of Britain's working-age population carried out by Dame Carol Black estimated that over £100 billion is lost to the economy through ill-health and associated sickness absence and unemployment, and the Government estimates around one third - £30-40 billion - can be attributed to mental ill-health, in lost production, and National Health Service (NHS) treatment. This first national framework for mental health and employment establishes a cross-government approach to tackling this cost and waste. The framework identifies six key areas where action is vital: action to change attitudes to mental health; action to improve health and well-being at work for the whole population; swift intervention when things go wrong; co-ordinated help tailored to individuals' needs both in and out of work; action to build resilience from early years and throughout working lives; co-ordinated action across government to ensure successful delivery. Action will be directed towards changing attitudes, supporting employers and joining up mental health, employment and other support services in government.

Over one million people with mental health conditions are on welfare benefits and the total number who are out of work may be double that figure. It is known that: appropriate employment actively improves mental health and well-being; people with mental health conditions do pursue successful careers; most people with a mental health condition who are out of work would like to be in paid employment. Yet a combination of prejudice and discrimination, low expectations, and failure to provide the necessary support, continue to deny many the opportunity to work. This review was commissioned to investigate how government could better help fulfil the employment ambitions of this sector of society. It covers the challenges faced by people with a mental health condition and outlines a vision for the future which involves: increasing capacity and dispelling myths; providing more support; effective monitoring and drivers for change. The proposals made can be achieved within existing resources by reviewing priorities, rebalancing resources and replacing traditional services that have proved relatively ineffective or produced poor employment outcomes.

It is a world of heartbreak, violence, and pain, where severely ill men are often lost in a tangle of courts, jails, and bureaucracy. It is also a place of challenges, redemption, and surprising joy, where tough, hardworking doctors and staff fight to care for and keep safe a population that many would like to forget. This is where Dr. Elizabeth Ford, now the Chief of Psychiatry for Correctional Health Services for New York City's Health and Hospitals, found her calling. Dr. Ford shares her stories of caring for these patients, from one of the most hated and alienated inmates at Rikers, who cries when discussing his abusive childhood, to the writer who agrees to treatment in exchange for Dr. Ford's take on the opening chapter of his book, to the twenty-four-year-old schizophrenic whom Dr. Ford later encounters on the streets of Manhattan, happy and healthy after finally finding the right medication. Ford's memoir is marked by explosive crises and episodes of violent psychosis, but also moving stories of compassion and hope in the face of overwhelming dysfunction.

But new research from neuroscien­tists and psychologists suggests that, in fact, the brain reorganizes, improves in important functions, and even helps us adopt a more optimistic outlook in middle age. Growth of white matter and brain connectors allow us to recognize patterns faster, make better judgments, and find unique solutions to problems. Scientists call these traits cognitive expertise and they reach their highest levels in middle age.In her impeccably researched book, science writer Barbara Strauch explores the latest findings that demonstrate, through the use of technology such as brain scans, that the middle-aged brain is more flexible and more capable than previously thought. For the first time, long-term studies show that our view of middle age has been misleading and incomplete. By detailing exactly the normal, healthy brain functions over time, Strauch also explains how its optimal processes can be maintained. Part scientific survey, part how-to guide, The Secret Life of the Grown-Up Brain is a fascinating glimpse at our surprisingly talented middle-aged minds.

But today the field of personality science has moved well beyond the nature vs. nurture debate. In Who Are You, Really? Dr. Brian Little presents a distinctive view of how personality shapes our lives--and why this matters. Little makes the case for a third nature to the human condition--the pursuit of personal projects, idealistic dreams, and creative ventures that shape both people's lives and their personalities. Little uncovers what personality science has been discovering about the role of personal projects, revealing how this new concept can help people better understand themselves and shape their lives"" -- provided by publisher.

"ADJUSTMENT TO CAREGIVING IN OLDER WIVES: VARIATIONS IN SOCIAL SUPPORT, HEALTH, AND PAST MARITAL ADJUSTMENT",Karen Meier Robinson,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264514W,/authors/OL5356784A/Karen_Meier_Robinson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 265,"The purpose of this research was to systematically investigate factors related to caregiver adjustment. Major variables of interest were caregiver health, past marital adjustment, and received social support. In addition, information was gathered on socioeconomic status and attitudes toward seeking support in order to investigate possible relationships with caregiver adjustment.  Subjects were 78 wives who served as primary caregivers to husbands with irreversible memory impairment and 75 significant others of the caregivers who were familiar with the caregiving situation. The mean age of the caregivers was 68 years. The mean length of time the caregivers had been caring for their husbands in the home was 4 years, 10 months. Structured interviews were used to gather data from the caregivers. Parallel interviews were conducted by telephone with the significant others.  A series of three hierarchical multiple regressions were used to predict the three dependent variables of objective burden, subjective burden, and depression. Caregiver health and attitude toward seeking help were significant ($p$.001) predictors of depression and accounted for 27% of the total explained variance (40%). Past marital adjustment was a significant ($p$.001) predictor of subjective burden and accounted for 20% of the total explained variance (22%). Socioeconomic status and attitude toward seeking help were the significant ($p$.001) predictors of objective burden and accounted for 12% of the total variance (17%). Received social support did not predict caregiver adjustment. The finding that caregiver health was significantly related to depression suggests that nurses should assess and intervene to help caregivers maintain physical health.

HEALTH STATUS OF FEMALE CAREGIVERS IN RELATION TO LOCUS-OF-CONTROL AND SELECTED SITUATIONAL VARIABLES,Lorraine Blanche Anderson,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264512W,/authors/OL5356782A/Lorraine_Blanche_Anderson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 389,"In this study the health status of female caregivers to dependents 75 years or older was examined in relation to their locus of control beliefs, the functional status of the dependent, living arrangement, hours of care, and selected demographic factors. Old old people are increasing in the population, so there are more elderly needing caregivers. It is important to examine the health status of caregivers to determine if their health status may be negatively affected. Also, caregivers' health status affects their ability to remain in the caregiving role.  A convenience sample of 51 caregivers was interviewed, using a structured interview, self-report questionnaires, and open-ended questions. Included in the measurement of locus of control were general, situation-specific, desired, and experienced beliefs.  Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to examine relationships between variables. T tests were used to examine differences between groups. The statistical significance level was set at.10.  Results indicated that the more external caregivers were in their general beliefs about locus of control, the angrier they were, and the lower their physical well-being. The more external caregivers were in their situation-specific locus of control beliefs, the less tense, fatigued and angry they were, and the better their health practices. Caregivers who experienced less control than desired were more angry.  The less sociable the caregiver perceived the dependent to be, the more anger the caregiver experienced. Among caregivers, those who were providing more hours of care were significantly more fatigued and more angry than caregivers who were providing fewer hours of care. Caregivers who lived with their dependents were significantly more angry and more fatigued than caregivers who were not living with their dependents. Daughters caring for their mothers were more angry and more fatigued than women caring for people other than their mothers.  It was concluded that caregivers who experienced less control than desired and daughters caring for their mothers may be at risk for physical and psychological health problems.

PREDICTORS OF CAREGIVING BEHAVIORS OF FORMAL CAREGIVERS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED PEOPLE WITH DEMENTING ILLNESSES,Joan Leslie Fopma-Loy,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272518W,/authors/OL5363112A/Joan_Leslie_Fopma-Loy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 243,"This study utilized an attributional theoretical framework to explore factors predicting caregiving behaviors of formal caregivers of residents with dementing illnesses. The stimuli for elicitation of attributions, expectations, feelings, and caregiving behaviors were vignettes describing behavior of a resident. Gender of the story character, type of behavior (agitation and lack of self-care), and caregiver competence (stress, burden, and knowledge) were examined as factors potentially affecting types of attributions made. The ability of attributions to predict expectations and feelings, and the ability of expectations and feelings to predict behaviors were investigated. The effect of gender of the story character on expectations, feelings, and behavior was also explored.  The convenience sample was comprised of 107 female nursing staff members. Instruments included the Formal Caregiver Attributions Inventory (FCAI), The Formal Caregiver Stress Instrument (FCSI) and the Formal Caregiver Burden Scale (FCBS). Reliabilities of instruments were found to be satisfactory. T-tests, correlations, and multiple regressions were used to analyze the data.  Caregiver burden, stress, and knowledge were not found to be predictive of types of attributions made for the stimulus character's behavior. Findings supported the hypothesized relationship between attributions and expectations. Attributions did not predict affective reactions for either the agitated resident or the resident exhibiting a lack of self-care activity. The hypothesized relationship between expectations and caregiving behavior was supported for the resident exhibiting a lack of self-care activity. Caregivers who anticipated increased participation in self-care activity in the future were more likely to demonstrate therapeutic caregiving behaviors than those who anticipated declining self-care activity. Subjects had greater expectations for improved functioning of female stimulus residents than male stimulus residents exhibiting a lack of self-care activity.  Findings support the potential usefulness of increasing formal caregivers' awareness of their attributions for the behaviors of residents, and the possible effects of attributions on expectations and caregiving behaviors. Further theoretical development particularly with regard to factors determining attributional analyses and outcomes is recommended.

INTERPRETATION OF CONFUSION IN THE AGED: CONFLICTING MODELS OF CLINICAL REASONING AMONG NURSES,Marianne Cathleen Mccarthy,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272776W,/authors/OL5363332A/Marianne_Cathleen_Mccarthy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 257,"The purpose of this investigation was to generate a substantive theory of clinical reasoning among nurses who care for confused older patients in the hospital. Analysis was undertaken to discover factors which lead to the failure to detect and manage acute confusional states in this patient population. A Grounded Dimensional Analysis approach to inquiry and analysis was employed.  A purposive sample of 20 registered nurses with at least two years of acute care experience was interviewed. Interviews were semi-structured according to a theoretical sampling technique and were tape-recorded. Data were transcribed and then analyzed according to the techniques of dimensional analysis in which conceptualization emerges from the data to specify and define the context and consequences of phenomena.  Results of the analysis revealed that nurses who work with the elderly in acute care settings have different philosophical orientations towards basic health in aging. These orientations serve as perspectives which influence their thinking and action. Perspectives condition the ways in which older people are judged and are ultimately dealt with in the clinical arena by nurses.  Three philosophical orientations were identified. They were referred to as: (1) Decline Perspective, (2) Vulnerable Perspective, and (3) Healthful Perspective. According to these perspectives, nursing views about aged health vary along a continuum ranging from a notion of aging health as decremental to aging health as intact. Corresponding patterns of clinical reasoning were reflective of these contrasting notions.  The three patterns of clinical nursing reasoning differed relative to the nature of observations made, the meaning attached to these observations, and to the nursing actions taken. Findings from this study suggest that nurses who use the Decline Perspective when making clinical judgments are least likely to identify acute confusional states in older patients. Those nurses who reason from the Healthful Perspective are most apt to differentiate between acute and chronic confusions. Lastly, the outcome of decisions made by nurses who use the Vulnerable Perspective are difficult to predict because of the ambiguity which pervades all aspects of their clinical reasoning.  Since the three reasoning patterns identified are more particular than the general model of clinical judgment traditionally described, the results from this dissertation study provide a more complete understanding of the processes and nuances involved in nursing decision-making related to a specific clinical situation. Predictions about the quality of nursing care provided to older confused patients can be made based upon these findings.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
DEMENTIA CARE: INTERVENTIONS AND FACTORS INFLUENCING CAREGIVING APPROACHES,Lois B.

Naturalistic inquiry (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) was used to guide the descriptive, exploratory design of the study.  Twenty clients with dementia, selected from a dementia-specific adult day care center, were included in the sample, and family and professional caregivers served as informants. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data. The interview guides were developed based on a pilot study in which family and professional caregivers responded to open-ended questions about behavior in dementia, interpretations of behavior, and caregiving practices. Interviews were combined with quantitative measures of agitated behavior and mental status to stratify the data and compare similarities and differences in caregiving approaches. Quantitative data on dimensions of agitation were collected using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Cohen-Mansfield, Marx, & Rosenthal, 1989) and mental status was measured by the Mini-Mental State Exam (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975).  Constant comparative analysis was used to develop and refine coding categories resulting in a taxonomy of caregiving approaches comprised of seven domains. The use of social approaches was reported most frequently followed by psychological, functional, behavioral, environmental, medical, and cognitive approaches. Six factors identified as influencing caregiving approaches were level of client functioning, relationship of the caregiver to the person with dementia, dimensions of agitated behavior, caregivers' interpretations of the causes of agitated behavior, caregivers' interpretations of whether agitated behavior is beyond the control of the person with dementia, and caregivers' perceptions of personal strengths in the person with dementia. Findings led to working hypotheses suggesting that the choice of caregiving approach varies according to differences in client characteristics and differences in the perceptions and interpretations of caregivers. The findings support the application of a social model in dementia care and suggest alternatives to the use of chemical and physical restraints.

PREDICTORS OF RESTRAINT USE IN NURSING HOME RESIDENTS FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE RESTRAINTS,Eileen M. Sullivan-Marx,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280268W,/authors/OL5369425A/Eileen_M._Sullivan-Marx,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 137,"Based on evidence of negative effects and limited efficacy of physical restraint of older adults, efforts to eliminate physical restraint use in nursing homes in the United States coalesced in federal legislation (Nursing Home Reform Law) implemented in 1990. Despite diverse attempts, such as policy mandates, education, or intensive nursing and system efforts, use of physical restraints in U.S. nursing homes in 1992 still exceeded that of other Western countries.  This study was a secondary analysis of an existing data set developed to test the effects of interventions designed to reduce restraint use in nursing homes. The present study examined predictors of restraint use in those nursing home residents who were either continuously or newly restrained following interventions aimed at restraint reduction. Using a one group pre-test post-test design, contextual factors and resident characteristics known to be associated with restraint use were examined to establish predictors of continued and initiated restraint use employing logistic regression analysis.  Of the nursing home residents restrained prior to interventions (N = 201), 135 (67.2%) were still restrained following the interventions. Lower cognitive status (odds ratio:2.4, 95% CI:1.7, 3.3) and fall risk as reason for restraint (odds ratio:3.5, 95% CI:1.5, 8.0) were predictive of continued restraint use. Of the nursing home residents not restrained prior to the interventions (N = 335), 23 (6.9%) were newly restrained. Lower cognitive status (odds ratio:1.5, 95% CI:1.0, 2.1) and a greater ratio of licensed nursing personnel (predominantly licensed practical nurses) to non-licensed nursing personnel (odds ratio:3.7, 95% CI:1.2, 11.9) were predictive of initiation of restraint use.  Key findings of the study suggest that continued restraint use in nursing homes occurs with residents who are severely cognitively impaired and when staff believe the resident to be at risk for falling, despite a lack of objective verification of fall risk. Initiation of restraint use following interventions is a less common event but occurs when a nursing home resident is cognitively impaired and when staff mix has a greater proportion of licensed (particularly licensed practical nurses) than non-licensed nursing personnel.

CAREGIVER BURDEN AND THE CHANGES IN CAREGIVING FOLLOWING NURSING HOME PLACEMENT IN TAIWAN,Shu-Hui Yeh,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280490W,/authors/OL5369636A/Shu-Hui_Yeh,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 125,"As a result of economic and health improvements in the general population, there is an increasing need for long-term care facilities for the elderly in Taiwan. Little is known about the caregiving practice and burden of Chinese family members who place their elderly in nursing homes. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe changes in caregiving practice and perceived burden from initial nursing home placement (Time 1) to 4 months after nursing home placement (Time 2) among Chinese primary caregivers of the elderly. A descriptive correlational design was used to describe and explore the extent of burden and changes in caregiving.  Structured questionnaires and interview questions were used to assess 77 primary family caregivers who live in Taipei City and have placed their elderly in a nursing home for the first time. All questions were translated into Chinese, and ""back translation"" from Chinese to English was completed prior to the interviews. Content validity of Chinese questionnaires was assessed by 5 Chinese researchers. A pilot study was conducted, and Chinese questionnaires were modified based on the pilot work. Correlation, paired t test, multiple regression, and content analysis were used to examine the research questions.  The results indicated the contribution to perceived burden caused by lack of family support, impact on schedule, and impact on health. All three were significantly decreased from Time 1 to Time 2 among the primary caregivers. The overall perceived burden of caregiving was significantly decreased from Time 1 to Time 2. However, the impact on finances and caregivers' self-esteem was not changed significantly. The frequency of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living assistance provided by the primary caregivers decreased after the placement. The primary caregivers reported significant improvement in their physical health, but not emotional health from Time 1 to Time 2. The higher burden of caregiving at Time 2 is predicted by (a) higher burden at Time 1, (b) caregiver's higher educational level, and (c) poor health at Time 2. Seven types of assistance were mentioned by the primary caregivers as needed to help them manage their caregiving practices. Recommendations for nursing practice and future research are also included.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
QUALITY OF LIFE OF ELDERLY WOMEN WITH SPINAL FRACTURES SECONDARY TO OSTEOPOROSIS,Cathy Robin Kessenich,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281340W,/authors/OL5370420A/Cathy_Robin_Kessenich,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 290,"The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of sociodemographic characteristics, bone density, bone fractures, perceived health, pharmacologic agents, and exercise on the quality of life of community dwelling elderly women with spinal fractures due to osteoporosis. Roy's adaptation model and quality of life provided the conceptual framework. Descriptive statistics and regression-based path analysis were used to analyze the data. A nonexperimental causal model was tested with a convenience sample of 105 elderly women with osteoporotic spinal fractures living independently in a rural New England community. Data were collected using an investigator-developed sociodemographic questionnaire, the Cantril Ladder, the Yale Physical Activity Scale, the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire, and a medical record review. Findings revealed that transportation by a friend, spinal fractures, and health perception had direct effects on quality of life. Perception of financial security, participation in a research study, and attitude toward retirement had indirect effects on quality of life through spinal fractures and health perception. Age, religion, marital status, type of residence, level of education, bone density, hip fractures, Colles fractures, pharmacologic agents, and exercise had no effect on quality of life. The variables in the causal model accounted for 63% of the variance ($Rsp2$ =.63) in quality of life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
NURSES' PERCEPTIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF ACUTELY CONFUSED PATIENTS (CONFUSION),Li-Fen Wu,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278779W,/authors/OL5368141A/Li-Fen_Wu,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 209,"Despite its prevalence, incidence, and life-threatening consequences, much remains unknown about acute confusion in acutely ill elders. Moreover, it is difficult to integrate the existing research findings into a comprehensive body of knowledge. The purpose of this study was to provide an analysis of the clinical phenomenon ""acute confusion"" from the perspective of the registered nurses who cared for elderly hospitalized patients. In this study, registered nurses' perception of acute confusion was assessed by understanding how they defined, identified acute confusion and described acutely confused patients. The hybrid model for concept development provided the conceptual framework for this study. From a statewide membership list of the INA registered nurses who worked in medical and/or surgical areas of acute care hospitals, 600 subjects were selected randomly, and mailed a three-part semistructured questionnaire with five open-ended and 121 forced-choice questions constructed by the investigator. Two hundred fourteen subjects returned questionnaires, a response rate of 35.67%.  Subjects defined acute confusion as disorganized thinking, disorientation, behavior (verbal and/or physical) that is unusual for that individual, or inappropriate to the situation, and of sudden onset and short duration. The subjects identified acute confusion primarily by constantly observing the elderly patient's cognitive function and behavior. Also, asking questions and obtaining information from family members or close friends were two additional methods used to identifying acute confusion.  Four dimensions were disclosed by factor analysis to describe acutely confused elderly patients: (1) unusual and/or inappropriate behavior, (2) disorganized thinking, (3) altered sensory and motor function, and (4) disturbed perception. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of each factor was greater than 0.7, and the overall internal consistency was 0.915.  Based on the content above, registered nurses perceived acute confusion as a multidimensional phenomenon reflected by both cognition and behavior disturbances. Suggestions for further research address issues relative to (a) conceptual/theory development, and (b) clinical issues.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The model developed for this study assumed in older adults that spirituality, hope, health and social support variables are essential concepts within which MIL occurs. Furthermore, the absence of a clear MIL may contribute to the presence of depression, and depression is usually present in conjunction with thoughts of suicide.  This study used a comparative survey design to examine relationships between spirituality, hope, health, social support, MIL, depression and suicide. The primary data collection method was quantitative, however, qualitative methods were used to enhance the quantitative data. The sample of 160 older adults included equal numbers of men and women who were depressed and not depressed. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlations, analysis of variance, factor analysis, multiple regression and structural equation analysis.  Study findings showed there were few differences within the demographic variables, based on gender or diagnosis. There were few significant differences when the selected variables were examined for gender. However, there were statistically significant differences for the individual variables based on diagnosis. Findings from the qualitative analysis supported quantitative findings.  The findings supported all but one of the hypotheses: (1) higher levels of MIL were associated with higher levels of spirituality, hope, health and social support, (2) the nondepressed sample had higher levels of MIL, spirituality, hope, health and social support, (3) there was an inverse relationship between MIL and depression and (4) higher levels of MIL and lower levels of depression predicted lower levels of suicidality. Findings did not support the hypothesis that females would have higher levels of MIL, spirituality, hope, health and social support than males. Structural equation analysis supported the hypothesis that spirituality, hope, health and social support moderate the relationships between MIL, depression and suicide behavior. These findings have implications for nursing practice, theory development, and future research.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"EFFECT OF MOVEMENT GROUP THERAPY ON DEPRESSION, MORALE AND SELF-ESTEEM IN AGED WOMEN",Joyce A.

The research questions were: (1) What effect does movement group therapy have on depression, morale, and self-esteem in aged women? (2) What is the relationship between certain demographic variables and depression, morale, and self-esteem?.  A quasi-experimental pre/post test design was used to test the four research hypotheses of the study. The hypotheses summarily stated are: Women who participate in movement group therapy will have lower depression, higher morale, higher behavior-morale, and higher self-esteem than women who do not participate in movement group therapy.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) findings for hypotheses one through four revealed that significant differences (p = $<$0.05) existed among the four study groups for levels of depression, morale, behavior-morale and self-esteem. Significant differences were also found for pre-post test conditions and interaction relative to behavior-morale.  Duncan's range test for mean differences revealed that group E1 differed significantly from group E2 in relation to behavior-morale. Additionally, group E1 was the only group to experience a significant (p = 0.05) change in pre to post test scores. Simple F test findings for differences in rates of gain in behavior-morale revealed that subjects in movement therapy group E1 significantly (p = $<$0.05) improved when compared with the other three groups.  Movement therapy group E1 had the lowest mean pre-post test behavior-morale scale (BMS) scores, but demonstrated a significant rate of gain in mean BMS scores (p = $<$0.05). Group E2 had the highest mean BMS score at pre and post test, although the rate of gain overtime was not significant.  Simple correlation analysis revealed that posttest depression was negatively associated with length of time in nursing home and positively associated with hypnotic/sedative type medicines. Posttest behavior-morale was positively associated with congenital anomalies and negatively associated with: (1) the use of antibiotic type medication, (2) bedbath, and (3) blood pressure reading (p = $<$.05). No significant correlations existed between morale, self-esteem, and the demographic/status variables. This study provided empirical support for theoretical and clinical positions postulating a direct relationship between movement therapy and improvement in psychological well-being among the aged.

"STRESS, SOCIAL SUPPORT, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC HEART DISEASE",Maureen Mccarthy Friedman,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268221W,/authors/OL5359992A/Maureen_Mccarthy_Friedman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 239,"The purpose of this study was to test whether perceived enacted informational, tangible, and emotional support and their adequacy buffered the stress related to heart disease. In addition, the study described the stressors and perceived stress related to heart disease for older women, their role relationships with their support providers, and the degree that support providers served as social comparison targets. A non-experimental descriptive correlational design was employed with a convenience sample of 80 non-institutionalized women 55-92 years of age with chronic heart disease. The three types of perceived enacted support and their adequacy were measured with Krause's (1986) modified version of The Inventory of Socially Supportive Behavior (Barrera et al., 1981). Psychological distress was measured with the Negative Affect scale of the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988). Psychological well-being was measured with the Positive Affect scale of the PANAS and the Satisfaction with Life Test (Diener, 1985). Stressors, perceived stress, and social comparison were measured with two instruments developed by the investigator.  This study did not find support for the buffering hypothesis in this sample of older women with chronic heart disease. A direct effect for perceived enacted emotional support was found on positive affect and satisfaction with life. Positive affect was significantly higher for those subjects with high emotional support and low stress than for those subjects with low emotional support and low stress. Tangible support adequacy had a significant positive effect on satisfaction with life.  Symptoms of the illness and difficulty with household tasks were the most frequent stressors related to chronic heart disease. Married women identified their husbands as their most frequent providers of informational, tangible, and emotional support. Women who were widows, divorced, or separated identified their children as their most common emotional support sources, other professionals as their most common informational support providers, and paid helpers as their most common tangible support sources. The women infrequently compared themselves with their support providers. Lateral comparisons on coping were positively related to positive affect.

A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY OF SURVIVORS OF ADULT CANCER,Barbara Jean Carter,mental_health,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265904W,/authors/OL5358008A/Barbara_Jean_Carter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 448,"It is estimated that 10% of the adult female population will develop breast cancer at some point in the life cycle (American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures, 1988). Five-year survival rates for breast cancer are among the highest of the various types of cancer (Silverberg and Lubera, 1989), yet little is known about the long-term adjustment of survivors.  The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experience of breast cancer survivors. A phenomenological interpretive approach was used to collect and analyze the stories of 25 San Francisco Bay Area women, 40-78 years of age, with 5-26 years survival time. Interviews were transcribed, then analyzed, and organized by paradigm cases, exemplars, and themes.  Informants described ""going through,"" a survival process that involved movement through several phases, sometimes simultaneously. The phases included: (a) interpreting the diagnosis; (b) confronting mortality; (c) reprioritizing; (d) coming to terms; (e) moving on; and (f) flashing back. Phases were interpreted within the context of informants' backgrounds, sources of meaning, and models of understanding illness.  The background ways of being from which informants interpreted experience included: (a) surviving the dynamics of alcoholism; (b) relating spiritually to God; (c) manifesting a pessimistic view of life; (d) controlling events and emotions; and (e) doing or performing. Close human relationships, work, and religion provided informants with common sources of meaning. Informants' models of understanding illness included: (a) personal growth, (b) sin, (c) fate; (d) stress and coping; and (e) medical.  Informants interpreted cancer as a protest about something in their lives that gave them the ""permission to be"" more authentic. They described the emergence of a more authentic Self that was then shaped over time through interactions with others. Many informants emerged from the cancer experience with a clearer sense of Self, gratitude for life, and strength and confidence in their ability to manage life crises.

ANTECEDENTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF PERCEIVED MEMORY ADEQUACY IN ELDERS,Sandra Lynn Cromwell,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278105W,/authors/OL5367548A/Sandra_Lynn_Cromwell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 362,"The purpose of this study was to test one theoretical explanation for elders' perceived current adequacy of everyday remembering, and the antecedent perceptions, values and beliefs, and consequent feelings related to this perception. Fourteen hypotheses, deduced from the theory of subjective forgetfulness in elders (Cromwell, 1991), tested one theoretical explanation for the relationships among: Personal Importance of Remembering, Perceived Seriousness of Forgetting, Perceived Frequency of Forgetting, Belief in a Relationship between Aging and Memory Decline, Belief in a Personal Health Risk for Memory Decline, Perceived Current Adequacy of Everyday Remembering, Distress about Current Forgetting, Concern about Future Forgetting and Self Esteem in elders.  Multiple regression analysis of the data obtained from 202 community based elders, age 65 to 97, supported the assertions that perceiving self to forget frequently negatively influenced elders' judgments of their current memory adequacy and increased their distress about current forgetting. Believing that one had risk factors for memory decline influenced the current distress experienced about forgetting, and the level of concern about future memory. Present concerns about forgetting, in response to perceived frequency of forgetting and perceived risks, influenced in part the degree to which the present situation was viewed as a warning sign of potential progressive future decline. Concerns about memory and forgetting influenced elders' level of self esteem.  Intriguing differences in the relationships among antecedent perceptions, values and beliefs, and consequent feelings about self were discovered between older and younger elders, and between elders who highly valued remembering and those for whom remembering was of lesser importance.  Future research to expand our understanding of the subjective experience of forgetfulness in elders and potential future intervention research to increase perceived memory adequacy and decrease present and future concerns were proposed.

"SATISFACTION WITH RESIDENCY, SENSE OF WELL-BEING, PERCEPTION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND SELECTED DEMOGRAPHICS AS DETERMINANTS OF LONELINESS IN ELDERLY NURSING HOME RESIDENTS",Rita Kay Spinn,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278205W,/authors/OL5367625A/Rita_Kay_Spinn,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 238,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among satisfaction with residency, sense of well-being, social support, demographic variables and loneliness in elderly nursing home residents. An adaptation of Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress appraisal-buffer theory provided the theoretical framework for the study. There were 78 females and 14 males, aged 65 and older in the convenience sample living in three skilled nursing facilities in a mid south suburban area. Instruments included Russell & Cutrona's (1984) UCLA Loneliness Scale, Moos's (1984) Sheltered Care Environment Scale, Dupuy's (1984) Psychological General Well-Being Schedule, and Norbeck's (1980) Social Support Questionnaire. Quantitative data were analyzed using Pearson Product-Moment correlation and hierarchical multiple regression. Results of the analysis showed significant inverse relationships at the.000 level between satisfaction with residency and loneliness; sense of well-being and loneliness; and social support and loneliness. Among the major and demographic predictor variables, psychological general well-being, perception of social support, satisfaction with residency, and ethnicity accounted for 66% of the variance in loneliness (p =.000). Implications and recommendations for nursing practice, education, and research were identified.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"SOCIAL SUPPORT, SELF-WORTH AND HOPE AS SELF-CARE RESOURCES FOR COPING WITH CAREGIVER STRESS (ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE)",Barbara Louise Irvin,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278268W,/authors/OL5367683A/Barbara_Louise_Irvin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 186,"The problem addressed in this study is the lack of knowledge about the ways in which caregivers adapt to the chronic stress of caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this correlational study was to develop and test a mid-range model derived from the theory of Modeling and Role-Modeling (Erickson, Tomlin & Swain, 1983) which explained the relationships among perceived social support, self-worth and hope as self-care resources for coping with caregiver stress in the context of Alzheimer's disease. The study comprised the first phase of testing a larger model of caregiver stress-adaptation and provided useful information related to the model structure and evaluation as well as implications for nursing practice, research and mid-range theory development.  The sample consisted of 107 primary caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease recruited through a variety of sources in the greater central Texas area. Data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed using a path model and regression procedures. Instruments included the Personal Resource Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Miller Hope Scale and the Burden Interview.  Results of the study showed that responses to stressors may be mediated somewhat by self-care resources such as hope, self-worth and perceived social support. There were moderate to strong relationships among the variables in the expected directions. Social support directly explained 19% of the variance in self-worth as well as 34% of the variance in hope. In addition, social support was shown to have an indirect effect on hope through self-worth. Adding self-worth to the regression equation increased the explained variance in hope to 56%. Thus, the proposition that feelings of worthiness result in a sense of hope for the future was supported.  Social support directly explained 18% of the variance in stress. Further, the addition of self-worth to the equation increased explained variance in stress to 23%. Path analysis demonstrated that hope had a direct and positive effect on stress, explaining 15% of the variance. However, empirical testing of the full model showed that hope did not make any significant contribution toward explaining variance in stress after social support and self-worth had entered the equation. A goodness-of-fit test showed that the theoretical model had a moderate fit with the data (Q =.90). Further testing of the model is recommended.

BURDEN AND HUMOR: RELATIONSHIPS TO MENTAL HEALTH IN SPOUSE CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,Martha Davis Buffum,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273691W,/authors/OL5364134A/Martha_Davis_Buffum,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 273,"Depression has been identified as the major mental health problem in spouses caring for their husbands or wives with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since a growing body of literature reports the physiological, immunological, psychological, and social benefits of humor and laughter, this descriptive study was designed to examine the relationships among caregiver burden, use of humor, and mental health in spouses caring for their AD patients at home. The Buffum Caregiver Humor Use Assessment Tool (BCHUAT) was developed for this population, and beginning psychometric evaluation was performed. The sample consisted of 72 spouse caregivers, the majority of whom were white women with middle-range incomes (60% female, 40% male; age 72.7 $pm$ 6.2 years).  Instruments utilized in this cross-sectional mail survey included Medical Outcome Study Mental Health Index, Caregiver Burden Interview, Coping Humor Scale, Demographic Data Sheet, and BCHUAT. Initial support for the reliability and construct validity of the new instrument was demonstrated in this study. Correlation, multiple regression, ANOVA, and chi-square tests were used to analyze the data.  Significant findings include: (1) burden explained 34% (p $<$.001) of variance in mental health; (2) use of humor explained 11% (p $<$.001) of variance in mental health; (3) use of humor is negatively related to burden (p $<$.01); (4) husbands rate their AD patients with higher severity ratings than do wives (p $<$.001); (5) satisfaction with help has a negative association with burden (p $<$.001) and a positive association with mental health (p $<$.001). Compared to non-caregivers, this sample was psychologically distressed, suffering from more anxiety and depression.  The use of humor is positively associated with mental health but it does not significantly mediate the impact that burden has on caregivers' mental health. While no causal inferences can be made from convenience sampling, the study findings suggest that AD caregivers use humor to cope with the devastating symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. Hence, the focus of future nursing research and practice should be the identification of factors related to the reduction of caregiver burden, evaluation of satisfaction with help, and effectiveness of humor intervention in enhancing caregiver outcomes. Further validation of the BCHUAT is warranted with diverse caregiver groups.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
HOSPITAL DISCHARGE PREPARATION FOR HOMEWARD BOUND ELDERLY,Diane Storer Brown,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273579W,/authors/OL5364032A/Diane_Storer_Brown,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 149,"Hospital discharge planning (DCP) for the elderly is a research priority. Within the cost conscious healthcare environment, there is concern about short hospitalizations and responsibility shifts to patients for continued health care. While Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) provide care for many elderly, there is no research on DCP outcomes for elderly HMO patients. The purpose of this study was to explore outcomes of DCP for elderly medical patients, satisfaction, service utilization, and relationships among the hospital environment, patients, and discharge outcomes.  This study utilized a descriptive correlational design within an HMO hospital. A convenience sample of 140 patients age 65 years or older, and returning home were enrolled over one year. Subjects stated satisfaction with instruction and preparation for discharge. Knowledge scores for new regimes ranged from 72% to 95% of the possible score for activities, medications, diet, and treatments. After discharge, 76% stated they were involved in DCP but 86% of their families were not.  Subjects utilized 2121 services or supplies. Prior to hospitalization, 33% used 93 services; 53% required 127 at discharge; and within 30-days of discharge, all subjects used 1901 services. Additional needs were identified by 21%. Within 30 days, 13% were readmitted to the hospital; all had stated they were prepared for discharge.  Patient characteristics significantly explained variance in three outcomes. After multiple regression analyses, the percent of explained variance ranged from 11 to 17 for medication knowledge, arrangements, and services $(p<.01).$ Hospital variables were related to individual outcomes but were not significant in multiple regression analyses. Continuity of care was related to satisfaction $(r=.21,$ $p<.01)$ and the number of advice telephone calls $(r=.17,$ $p<.05).$ RN Workload was related to the number of emergency room visits (r = $-$.23, $p<.01),$ diagnostic tests (r = $-$.17, $p<.05),$ and additional referrals (r =.24, $p<.01).$.  This study reinforced the importance of DCP for elderly patients--the majority were discharged with a regime change and service needs. Medication knowledge scores were low and patient ability to learn instruction was unclear. Patients may have been too ill to learn, their stay too short, or they may not have had the need to learn what health care providers considered essential.

Firms' demand for employment-based mental health benefits,Judith Shinogle,mental_health,First published in 2005,/works/OL5893255W,/authors/OL1453601A/Judith_Shinogle,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Employment-based health insurance is the main source of health coverage for the non-elderly.  Few previous studies have examined the factors that impact employer decision-making in selecting the coverage to offer to their employees and none have examined generosity of mental health coverage.  This paper uses cross-sectional data from a survey of medium to large firms, including information on employee characteristics, to examine the empirical determinants of mental health coverage choices.  We find that the firm's demand for mental health coverage is strongly influenced by employee characteristics.  We also find that certain state and local policy interventions directed at enhancing access to mental health care have impacts on coverage decisions.  Specifically, public provision of mental health lowers mental health coverage generosity and parity legislation increases mental health generosity.  Future research with panel data is warranted to examine the causal effects of these policies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Health and Suffering in America,Robert T. Fancher,mental_health,First published in 2017,/works/OL21348825W,/authors/OL588880A/Robert_T._Fancher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Health and Suffering in America analyzes how we came to see various forms of suffering as ""mental illness,"" and argues that social and historical dynamics, not scientific discovery, gave us this notion. Robert Fancher argues that the beliefs of mental health professionals have less to do with science than with the professions' own values and ideologies. The image we have of mental health care hides vast realms of unexamined assumptions. In effect, the author maintains that ""mental health"" consists of mental health professionals' ideas about how people ought to live and act, not discoveries about human nature. The body of the book consists of detailed analyses and critiques of four infl uential American cultures of therapy: psychoanalysis, behaviorism, cognitive therapy, and biological therapy. Fancher emphasizes how heavily their concepts and methods are determined by their cultures rather than by empirical data. Furthermore, our notions of mental health are not scientifi c discoveries, but moral ideals. Yet mental health workers often fail to understand this. As a result, they misunderstand their own authority and, worse, fail to subject their moral ideals to appropriate moral and cultural criticism. The new introduction by the author explores how the rise of managed health care coalesces with insistence on parity for mental health problems, supported by continuing claims that mental health care is science-based.""--Provided by publisher.

It's by Prof Gijsbert Stoet, Department of Psychology, University of Essex, UK:  ""This is a much-needed introduction book for anyone interested in what makes men think and behave the way they do. It is a critically important and timely contribution to the wider literature on gender-related topics. The authors covers a wide range of relevant topics about boys and men, including child development, education, mental health and wellbeing, and more.  The book helps students and specialists alike to get an overview of the most important topics in the field of male psychology.  The authors have done an especially good job in making the text easy and enjoyable to read. The book is filled with fascinating and carefully referenced facts, spotlight boxes, and discussion points. What is particularly striking about this book is how the authors describe controversial issues with a nuanced tone and with a deep understanding of different viewpoints on approaches to studying and discussing masculinity. This makes the book particularly useful for psychology and social-sciences courses on male psychology and masculinit in the English-speaking world.  This is an essential read for both students and specialists alike.""

Our brains do their best to help us out, but every so often they can be real assholes―having melt downs, getting addicted to things, or shutting down completely at the worst possible moments. Your brain knows it’s not good to do these things, but it can’t help it sometimes―especially if it’s obsessing about trauma it can’t overcome. That’s where this life-changing book comes in.  With humor, patience, science, and lots of good-ole swearing, Dr. Faith explains what’s going on in your skull, and talks you through the process of retraining your brain to respond appropriately to the non-emergencies of everyday life, and to deal effectively with old, or newly acquired, traumas (particularly post-traumatic stress disorder).

THE EFFECT OF AN INTERGENERATIONAL PROGRAM ON CHILDREN'S ATTITUDES AND THE WELL BEING OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS (ELDERLY WELL-BEING),Justine E. Adam,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273667W,/authors/OL5364115A/Justine_E._Adam,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 87,"The present investigation measured children's attitudes toward the elderly. Some fifth and sixth graders from a Long Island school district made visits during the school year to a neighboring nursing home. Children's attitudes toward residents were measured using the semantic differential scale of the CATE (Children's Attitudes Toward the Elderly). The study also examined whether there was an effect on well being of nursing home residents. Well being was considered to be a function of level of depression, life satisfaction and self concept.  Results showed no significant differences in well being of the nursing home residents as an effect of the children's visits. However, upon interview, residents stated that they enjoyed the visits and commented that seeing the children reminded them of their own youth. The children's attitudes were affected. Those children who visited the nursing home had significantly more positive attitudes toward the elderly than children who made no visits. These results suggest that contact with the elderly can break stereotypes and inculcate positive attitudes toward aging and the elderly.

A convenience sample of 38 clients was identified by the nursing home medical director and director of nurses of each nursing home. Twenty clients were authorized by their families to participate in the study. Twenty more were identified as a comparison group, matched for dementia and agitation levels. All clients underwent medical screening to eliminate other possible causes of agitation. All subjects were also examined for level of cognition, level of dependency, and level of agitation. The twenty subjects in the treatment group were then given antidepressants, generally Prozac 10 mg daily. Small amounts of Sinequan or Desyrel were added if there was severe insomnia or anorexia. After 6 weeks, testing was repeated and results compared by t-test, in order to challenge the null hypothesis.  Results failed to support the null hypothesis which states that no significant difference exists between treatment and comparison groups at post-test on measures of agitation. While both groups demonstrated improvement in agitation levels, the improvement in the treatment group was significantly greater than in the comparison group. The difference is thought to be related to the administration of antidepressant medication.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And what is the potential for achieving emotional health through deliberate action, as we do with physical health? Clinical psychologist Camay Woodall, PhD, addresses these and many other complex questions in this work that cogently discusses parameters of emotional health. This book covers historical concepts; examines personality at its developmental stages and beyond; explains that ""normal behavior"" constitutes a wide range, whereas emotional symptoms are narrow and definable; and discusses the common aspects of normality we all share, such as the struggle for realism and the need for social connection, as well as coming to terms with guilt. Covering topics that include anxiety; self-esteem; depression; food (and the abuses of it), sex, love, and intimacy; shame and guilt; and spirituality, this book identifies common sources of dysfunctional personality traits and stresses the importance of individual responsibility in each area. -- from dust jacket.

Today, however, millions of people who are really no more than ""worried well"" are being diagnosed as having a mental disorder and receiving unnecessary treatment. In Saving Normal, Allen Frances, one of the world's most influential psychiatrists, explains why stigmatizing a healthy person as mentally ill leads to unnecessary, harmful medications, the narrowing of horizons, the misallocation of medical resources, and the draining of the budgets of families and the nation. We also shift responsibility for our mental well-being away from our own naturally resilient brains and into the hands of ""Big Pharma,"" who are reaping multi-billion-dollar profits. Frances cautions that the newest edition of the ""bible of psychiatry,"" the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), is turning our current diagnostic inflation into hyperinflation by converting millions of ""normal"" people into ""mental patients."" Saving Normal is a call to all of us to reclaim the full measure of our humanity.""   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

EFFECTS OF TEACHING ON COPING BEHAVIORS OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS,Alston Byefield Brown,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273768W,/authors/OL5364200A/Alston_Byefield_Brown,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 157,"Coping is a complex combination of thoughts and actions used by individuals to deal with real or perceived stress, and one potentially stressful situation is living in a family with a person who has a schizophrenic illness. This study was designed to investigate the effects of teaching on the effective coping behaviors of those family members. The relationship between the number of psychiatric hospitalizations of the persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and the coping behaviors of their family members was also examined.  Participants of this study were 40 family members of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who were admitted to a southeast Texas hospital. Subjects were divided equally into two groups, experimental and control. Subjects in the experimental group received structured teaching regarding schizophrenia, and those in the control group received no instructions.  The Personal Inventory Questionnaire (PIQ) was used to obtain demographic data, while the Folkman and Lazarus Revised Ways of Coping Scales (RWCS) was used as pre- and posttest measures of effective coping behaviors. Analysis of variance with repeated measures and Spearman rank coefficient correlation were used to analyze data from the RWCS. The level of significance was set at $ple.05.$ Findings indicated that (1) structured teaching did not significantly improve effective coping behaviors of family members of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia and (2) no significant relationship existed between the number of psychiatric hospitalizations of the schizophrenic patients and the effective coping behaviors of their family members.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF A PSYCHOEDUCATIONALLY BASED PROGRAM FOR POST-MASTECTOMY WOMEN,Joanie Koppelma Pritzker,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264703W,/authors/OL5356961A/Joanie_Koppelma_Pritzker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 224,"The purpose of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate formatively a psychoeducational treatment program for post-mastectomy women. The study combined the beneficial effect of developing a facilitator manual for a psychoeducational program for post-mastectomy women, ""Coping and Sharing: A Program For Women With Breast Cancer,"" with goal of educating post-mastectomy women about the disease process and facilitating health promoting behaviors. The major program objective was to empower participants to develop ways of meeting their informational and support needs by increasing their ability to use effective coping strategies. Offered in weekly sessions the educational program included knowledge about breast cancer, chemotherapy treatment, nutrition and daily health, body image, sexuality, breast reconstruction, communication and assertiveness skills, and stress reduction methods. The effects of the program and attitude toward sexuality were measured by comparing pre- and post-test scores using correlated t-tests.  The findings of this study were that women who participated in a psychoeducational treatment program demonstrated a significant gain in knowledge of the disease process. The participants also demonstrated a significant gain in perceived assertiveness skills, in coping with isolation and dealing with negative behaviors. The perceived behavioral change in the women who participated in the program indicates a favorable trend in light of the traumatic experience of breast cancer, its treatment modalities and the limited length (6 weeks) of the program.

The LeClair Integrated Conceptual Model was formulated and used as the conceptual framework.  Five questionnaires were utilized for data collection: Participant Information Sheet, Long-Term Complications Questionnaire, Short-Term Complications Questionnaire: Hypoglycemia, Short-Term Complications Questionnaire: Hyperglycemia, and the Herth Hope Scale. The Total Design Method was used for data collection. A convenience sample of 149 Type I diabetic adults, at least 25 years old, five years diabetic, and without additional chronic illnesses, were subjects. Multiple regression was utilized for data analysis.  Significant negative relationships were found between short-term complications and hope, and between long-term complications and hope. Disease longevity was not found to be significantly related to hope. One's perceived severity of all of his/her diabetic complications was more predictive of hope than were the independent variables. The research subjects were found relatively hopeful. The LeClair Integrated Conceptual Model was supportive and shown to be an effective representation of hoping and coping with chronic illness.

"BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL IN CRISIS (HEALTH CARE, CRISIS INTERVENTION)",Anne Louise Bateman,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278256W,/authors/OL5367671A/Anne_Louise_Bateman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 153,"The delivery system of health care to Americans is in crisis. As costs continue to escalate, and as access to services deteriorates, an increasing number of individuals in need of physical and mental health care are experiencing difficulty accessing the necessary services.  Changes in economic resources have resulted in quantitative shifts in mental health service delivery. A greater number of individuals seek mental health services as a result of the stress and anxiety created from a threatened or actual loss of financial stability. This increase in demand for service comes at a time when mental health programs are experiencing a decrease in resources which has resulted in reduced access to services.  The emergency mental health service utilization patterns and client characteristics have changed during the same period of time that the overall mental health care delivery system has undergone transformation. However, the changes in mental health care have not necessarily evolved out of careful rational planning, but rather as a response to chaotic shifts in the mental health system at large. The purpose of this study was to gather data about access to these mental health outpatient services as they related to client diagnostic characteristics, system ability to provide the service needed, and ability of the service to meet the client's perceived need.  The implications of the findings are clear. Access to services during a crisis was dependent upon system response, degree of psychopathology and a supportive environment. Any reform effort must include adequate crisis intervention and social services to meet the need of the changing population. Education for the general population and the professional would enhance understanding of the needs of the mentally ill and service availability.

"LESBIANS' EXPERIENCES WITH ALCOHOL PROBLEMS: A CRITICAL ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF PROBLEMATIZATION, HELPSEEKING AND RECOVERY PATTERNS (HELP-SEEKING)",Joanne M. Hall,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273581W,/authors/OL5364034A/Joanne_M._Hall,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 341,"There is evidence that lesbians have greater incidence of alcohol problems, and are collectively moving away from alcohol use. Discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, class and race complicate recovery for lesbians with alcohol problems. This critical ethnographic study addresses how lesbians identify alcohol problems, seek help and describe health care interactions related to alcohol problems. It also provides descriptions of lesbians' images of recovery and their personal and collective experiences in twelve-step mutual help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  A racially and socioeconomically diverse group of 35 self-identified San Francisco area lesbians recovering from alcohol problems volunteered for participation in indepth interviews. The interview data was examined through narrative analysis, matrix analysis and ethnographic coding. The findings indicate that problematization is ongoing, and includes identification of problems other than alcohol. A conceptual model of the problematization process is developed that emphasizes relationships among alcohol problem construction, interaction, action, validation and reconstruction. Accounts are differentiated on the basis of whether alcohol problems are perceived to be circumscribed or pervasive in the women's lives.  Helpseeking and health care needs are identified, including safety and validation in health care and treatment contexts, and attention to multiple addictive problems, aftereffects of childhood trauma and adolescence as a critical transition for lesbians. Six dimensions of safety in health care interactions are described: client/provider conceptual compatibility, providers' preparedness to interact with lesbians, respect for boundaries, emotional climate, provider persuasiveness strategies and group dynamics. Images used by lesbian participants to describe their recovery experiences include, in order of their prominence, connecting, reclaiming self, empowerment, struggle with compulsivity, personal growth, vocational change, social transition, cycles/celebration, physical transition and conversion. Twelve-step mutual help groups are an important though controversial part of recovery for lesbians; three dialectical tensions are identified: assimilation/differentiation, authority/automony and false consciousness/politicization.  Conclusions and implications for practice and research are guided by the concept of marginalization. Experiences of those living at the periphery of society not only differentiate them from those at the center, but from other marginalized persons, making standardized health care approaches to lesbians and others who are multiply stigmatized inappropriate.

AN INTERPRETIVE STUDY OF THE BULIMIC WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE OF RELATIONSHIPS,Mary Darlene Tantillo,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273021W,/authors/OL5363541A/Mary_Darlene_Tantillo,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 424,"The purpose of this dissertation was to access the meanings of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships in everyday life, in order to reveal a contextual understanding of this experience. Literature review revealed that the bulimic woman's experience of relationships has been conceptualized in terms of two main paradigms: the dominant paradigm of human psychological growth and development, and the newer, feminist relational paradigm. A critical examination of present theoretical understandings and previous research related to the bulimic woman's experience of relationships, revealed certain deficiencies and limitations in our understanding of this experience. In general, there was a dearth of research studies in the professional literature which examined the critical role of meaning and contextual understanding of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships.  The search for a research paradigm which would facilitate the development of a contextual understanding of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships led to the selection of a hermeneutic philosophy and approach to the study phenomenon. Specifically, Ricoeur's hermeneutic philosophy offered a methodological approach to understanding the bulimic woman's experience of relationships. The Ricoeurean hermeneutic approach emphasizes the understanding of contextual meanings which are revealed by a text. The contextual understanding of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships emerged from an interpretation of these contextual meanings. The text utilized in this inquiry was developed from seven dialogic sessions with a bulimic woman. The transcribed interviews contained a description of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships with (a) spouse, (b) mother, (c) father, (d) sister, (e) best friend, and (f) the researcher.  An initial, ""naive"" understanding of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships is presented first. This initial understanding is followed by a structural and semantic analysis of the text, which reveals a more informed, critical, and contextual understanding of the text and the bulimic woman's experience of relationships. This critical, contextual understanding reveals a world of meaning about the experience of relationships which is constitutive of certain human actions and temporal experiences. Specifically, a contextual understanding of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships revealed: (a) a world of paradox, (b) a world of explosions, and (c) a world characterized by ""times of loss, terror, and anxiety."" In addition, this world was one of many metaphors and was actually an extended ""ontological"" metaphor for human existence.  This study concludes with a dialogue between its findings and (a) previous research findings, and (b) the assumptions of the feminist relational paradigm. New insights and understandings which are not congruent with either of the main paradigms are outlined. Implications for nursing research, education, and practice are reviewed with an emphasis on a model of the bulimic woman's experience of relationships which is reciprocal, interactive, contextual, simultaneous, paradoxical, dialectical, and metaphorical in nature.

THE VOICE OF INNER STRENGTH IN WOMEN: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY,Janet Florence Rose,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264458W,/authors/OL5356753A/Janet_Florence_Rose,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 199,"The purpose of this study was to describe the meanings and structures of the lived experience of inner strength for women.  A phenomenological study was designed and implemented. A purposive sample of nine women was selected from Canada and the United States. The participants were able to acknowledge that they had the experience of inner strength, and they were able to articulate their lived experience of the phenomenon.  Data were generated using an unstructured, in-depth, face-to-face interview with the individual participants. The interviews were audiotaped and then transcribed. The focus for the interview was on the meanings and descriptions put forth by the participants of their lived experiences of inner strength. The researcher's prior knowledge and assumptions about the phenomenon were held in abeyance throughout the phases of data generation and analysis. A phenomenological analysis of the data was conducted that included methods adapted from Colaizzi, van Manen and Spiegelberg. Nine essential themes emerged from the data, and a formulated meaning of the structure of inner strength for women was developed.  The following themes represent the findings from this study: (1) quintessencing--recognizing, becoming, accepting, and being one's real self; (2) centering--balancing and focusing self; (3) quiescencing--availing oneself of quiet and calm; (4) apprehending intrication--seeing and understanding the complexities within situations; (5) introspecting--gaining self-awareness; (6) using humor; (7) interrelating--valuing mutuality, intimacy, and authenticity in relationships; (8) having capacity--experiencing depth and resourcefulness; and (9) embracing vulnerability--appreciating and accepting humanness and limitation as opportunities for growth.  The results of this study have implications for nursing theory, research, and practice. New meanings of the nature of inner strength have been generated by including the female perspective. This study also adds depth and breadth to the cumulative knowledge of women and expands the present base of understanding of the phenomenon of inner strength.

A NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF WOMEN'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH WOMEN (SELF-DEVELOPMENT),Aida Janet Sapp,mental_health,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279637W,/authors/OL5368890A/Aida_Janet_Sapp,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 410,"The purpose of this study was to explore significant relationships between women by analyzing the narratives related by women participants who have had or were experiencing enduring relationships with other women.  Using qualitative methods and a purposive sample, 26 adult women of diverse ethnic backgrounds participated in the study. Each woman was referred or self-selected into the study and acknowledged the presence of a significant relationship with another woman. The ages of the women ranged from 22 years to 87 years.  Data were obtained during semi-structured, in-depth, one-on-one interviews between the researcher and each woman in a setting of her choosing. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.  The sensitizing framework for the study included the five phenomena of growth-fostering relationships outlined by Miller and two additional relational concepts proposed by Miller and her colleagues. These added concepts were empathy and mutuality.  Themes derived and analyzed using Polanyi's methods of narrative analysis were: (1) the presence of vitality and energy in the relationship with a recurring reference to a sense of future together; (2) a sense of action in the relationship with a recurring reference to being a teacher or being a student in the relationship; (3) an accurate picture of self and other in the relationship, including cognitive and emotional knowledge; (4) a feeling of increased self worth and respect for the other in the relationship; and (5) a sense of connectedness both for the other woman and people outside the relationship, with a recurring reference to being well known to each other's family members. In addition to these five themes, the phenomenon of time passing in the relationship, the perception of cultural issues in the woman-to-woman relationship, and the experience of feeling personally diminished in the relationship were analyzed from the narratives.  The results of this study have implications for nursing theory, practice, and research. Close bonds between women contribute to the health and well-being of those in enduring relationships. In addition, the self-development of women is greatly enhanced in the context of the relationship.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Gail Annette Kiser Turman,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280574W,/authors/OL5369719A/Gail_Annette_Kiser_Turman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 265,"Purpose. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in women over 40 years of age, significantly contributes to the cause of death in younger women, and is the underlying cause of 250,000 female deaths annually in the United States (Heasley & Hughes, 1985; Wenger, 1992b). Much research has been conducted about every aspect of heart disease; yet, the subjects have been mostly men. The purpose of this study was to describe the woman's experience. The fundamental question was ""What was the experience of women following an acute myocardial infarction?"".  Sample. A purposive sample of seven women who had experienced a documented myocardial infarction comprised the sample. At the time of their infarcts, the women's ages ranged from forty-three to fifty-nine. Five were married, two were divorced. One of the six women who had children had minor children living at home.  Methods. This descriptive study used qualitative methodology. Open ended questions were asked in face to face, taped interviews. The analysis was based on the constant comparative methods of Glaser and Strauss using themes as the unit of analysis. The typed interviews were returned to the participants for data verification.  Findings. Eight themes emerged from these data: (1) ""women don't have heart attacks,"" (2) ""household work is not work,"" (3) ""fear and depression occur after an MI,"" (4) ""women are family caretakers,"" (5) ""alterations in family relationships occur after an MI,"" (6) ""women view recovery holistically,"" (7) ""social support is important"", and (8) ""the MI experience can result in positive outcomes."" Each theme consisted of various components. Moos' theory of stress and coping guided the study.  Implications. This study described selected women's experiences of their acute myocardial infarctions. The woman's definition of self, her role in the family, her perception of the meaning of the illness, and her ability to cognitively appraise the situation and select appropriate adaptive tasks determine the experience of an acute myocardial infarction for a woman. Educational programs and research are needed to facilitate appropriate nursing interventions and counseling for women during this experience.

DETERMINANTS OF CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR PERSONS TRANSITIONING FROM STATE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES TO COMMUNITIES (DISCHARGED MENTAL PATIENTS),Sarah Parcell Farrell,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280345W,/authors/OL5369500A/Sarah_Parcell_Farrell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 157,"When individuals with serious mental illness are discharged to the community, continuous and coordinated care are both desirable and necessary. A lack of continuity places the individual at risk for becoming lost to further services.  This study explores continuity of care for persons discharged from state psychiatric facilities in Virginia to communities. Continuity of care is defined as the successful initiation and maintenance of face-to-face contact by CSB staff with individuals to be discharged from state hospitals, and the subsequent provision of services post-discharge. This study identifies factors that influence continuity of care, examines the degree to which these factors play a role and the relationships between continuity of care and client characteristics.  Predictor variables include characteristics of the population-at-risk: predisposing factors (i.e., age, gender, race), enabling factors (i.e., living situation, catchment area change, and geographic location of the CSB) and need factors (i.e., length of stay, legal status, and primary diagnoses).  Data sources include two large data bases, (1) survey of CSB staff on the outcome of individuals discharged to their area in FY 1992, and (2) demographic information from state mental health authority.  Findings from the survey show that 83% of persons discharged had a record of the discharge at the CSB. In-hospital contact by CSB staff prior to discharge was lower (54%).  Results show that individuals are more likely to receive continuity of care if they are discharged to a CSB in a rural area, have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and do not have a primary diagnosis of substance abuse.  The theoretical framework, based on the Community Support System principles and the notion of vulnerability, leads to important policy and practice implications. For example, the study suggests that new and different programs might be more effective for individuals with substance abuse diagnoses, especially in urban areas.  Recommendations include a mandate for nursing provision of services, or oversight of services to assure continuity of care between service settings.  Future research could improve upon the measurement of the variables, and examine consumer and provider perceptions of continuity of care as an outcome.

"THE DAILY EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WITH ALCOHOLISM TEACHING TALES ABOUT WOMEN'S PROCESS (TREATMENT, RECOVERY)",Katherine Klaich,mental_health,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281520W,/authors/OL5370596A/Katherine_Klaich,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 398,"While only sixty percent of all women in America drink, it is estimated that one in every ten drinking women is an alcoholic or an alcohol abuser. Most of what is known about alcoholism is based upon studies of men. This is a theory building, interpretive study which seeks to (1) describe and interpret the lived experience of a conveniently selected group of women with alcoholism; (2) describe and interpret the environmental context within which these women exist; and (3) identify and describe environmental factors which are supportive or non-supportive of the alcoholic process in these women. The study utilized a feminist, phenomenological (Gademerian hermeneutic) methodology. Thirty-two women were recruited from two different treatment sites. They were interviewed at three different times during their treatment and recovery experience. The women were asked to describe themselves in the present and tell about how they (1) arrived at being treated for alcoholism; (2) experienced treatment; and (3) were doing thirty days after leaving treatment. In addition to the narrative data the women were asked to draw their addict self. Twenty women completed the entire study and formed the sample from which data were analyzed. The women ranged in age from 23-64 years of age. Analysis of data produced a vivid description of the daily experience of women with alcoholism including their sense of self, feelings and social connections. These three themes, self, feelings and connections, were described in depth. Changes in these themes were also described over the time period of the study. Discussion of the implications for treatment and follow-up care of women with alcoholism follows. Feminist interpretation of the data is also given along insights about the unspoken assumptions which shape the nature of the system of treatment available to alcoholics today.

"SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND DEPRESSION IN RURAL WOMEN OF VIRGINIA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY (HEALTH, STRESS, VICTIMIZATION)",Mary Ruth Boyd,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280088W,/authors/OL5369265A/Mary_Ruth_Boyd,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 305,"This study used a stress-vulnerability model to examine risk factors for substance abuse and depression among impoverished, rural women in Virginia. Based on diagnostic interview, three groups of women were identified: a group of substance abusing women (SA), a group of depressed women (D), and a group of healthy controls (C).  Components of the model were examined across groups. Those components included (1) sociodemographic factors, (2) vulnerability factors such as poverty and victimization, (3) stressful life events, and (4) outcome measures such as health and functional status and hopelessness.  There were no differences among the three groups on sociodemographic factors. The SA group and D groups differed from healthy controls in experiencing more victimization, more recent stressful events, and perceptions of greater health and mental health impairment.  The only factor that differentiated the SA women from the D group was the experience of victimization. SA women experienced twice the amount of victimization than women in the D group. Results suggest that the experience of victimization may have had several deleterious consequences for these women. Women who had experienced victimization reported more alcohol and drug related problems and significantly more depressive symptoms than women who were not victimized.  The SA group was examined in depth to determine specific characteristics of rural women who abuse drugs and alcohol. This revealed that the majority of SA women in this sample were polydrug users who began their substance abuse at young ages and progressed to problematic use within a short period of time. These women reported many serious physical and psychosocial problems related to their substance abuse. The only predictor of these problems was positive alcohol expectancies for those who abused alcohol. Escape coping was the only variable significantly correlated with number of drug problems.  Findings from this study have several implications for nursing. Those implications as well as suggestions for further research are discussed.

LIFEWAYS OF HOMELESS CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMUNITY HOUSING PROGRAM,Lin Joan Drury,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280060W,/authors/OL5369242A/Lin_Joan_Drury,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 170,"This study uses a modified ethnonursing approach (Leininger, 1985, 1991) to analyze qualitative data collected during two years of field work with a group of Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill Individuals (HCMI). Leininger's ethnonursing theory was used to promote a holistic view of the lifeways of HCMI individuals who were attempting to leave the streets. The data document the experiences of HCMI individuals who were placed in temporary community housing after discharge from a state mental hospital. Data analysis focuses upon explicating the specific needs of HCMI individuals within the sociocultural environment where those needs exist. This qualitative study explores the personal, cultural, and environmental contexts of life for HCMI individuals and describes the interaction between individuals' needs and community resources.  Individuals in the study group suffered from chronic mental illness, substance abuse, and physical illness. Their needs were expressed through efforts to function in the community. Direct requests for care were infrequent. Physical manifestations and circumstantial evidence symbolized unspoken needs. Unmet needs for care were demonstrated by critical incidents which disrupted community life such as household moves, legal disputes, and bureaucratic problems.  Findings revealed a culturally based pattern of mutual avoidance between HCMI individuals and caregivers which limited delivery of services to the population. Social policy issues underlying caregiver behavior were discussed. Recommendations include development of nurse-managed systems of care delivery, expansion of nurses' educational experiences with underserved populations, and additional qualitative longitudinal research on HCMI populations.

THE CONFLICT OF NURTURANCE FOR WOMEN: IMPLICATIONS FOR SELF-ESTEEM AND DEPRESSION (NURTURANCE CONFLICT),Virginia Joan Duffy,mental_health,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273905W,/authors/OL5364316A/Virginia_Joan_Duffy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 164,"This research explored the relationships between nurturance, self-esteem, and depression in the lives of ten American women. Nurturing behavior has been a societal expectation for women and has been viewed by feminist scholars and others as an important positive factor in the development of women's sense of self and self-esteem (Gilligan 1982, Miller 1976). It is imperative to understand self-esteem in women because of the strong relationship between low self-esteem and depression (Beck, 1967). Women in our society experience depression at rates two to three times higher than men (Lipsitt, 1982; OMH News, 1990). Thus, the relationship between gender and depression is an important area to be explored.  A qualitative study was conducted with 10 women participating in a psychotherapy group who were experiencing low self-esteem and depression. The constant comparative method of Grounded Theory (Chenitz & Swanson, 1986) was used to analyze 52 audiotapes of group discussions. The goal was to explore from these women's own perspective, the relationships between gender, nurturance, self-esteem, and depression.  Data analysis revealed a conflict in the lives of these women. A dark side of nurturing behavior emerged that gave evidence for this conflict. That is, although nurturing of others occasionally resulted in positive feelings, often it competed with personal needs and resulted in diminished self-esteem and depression. These women believed and accepted society's imperatives to nurture. This study suggests that when women's personal feelings conflict with societal demands to nurture, nurturing wins out. In such instances, nurturing behavior has a detrimental effect, often leading to depression. Data revealed that for these women the sense of being forced to choose nurturance over their own needs led to silencing of self-expression, distrust of themselves, and suppression of their self-awareness. Gilligan (1982) says that women often speak ""in a different voice,"" a voice of nurturance. For the women in this study, choosing nurturance over their own needs led to decreased self-esteem and increased depression. Thus, the theory of ""the conflict of nurturance"" emerged as one explanation for the low self-esteem and depression experienced by these women.  This study challenges the view that nurturance is the authentic voice of women and suggests the presence of other voices. The voice of nurturing appears to be socially learned, muffling other voices mistrusted and often hidden even from the participants themselves. The current findings demonstrate ""the conflict of nurturance"" as an important component of depression for these ten women. The findings of this research call for rethinking gender issues as they relate to depression and nurturance and offer new grounds for further research.

The documentation of behaviors of normal subjects is prerequisite to developing interventions with clients needing assistance with the mother-daughter relationship. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among the variables self differentiation, attachment, and two indicators of mental health (dysphoria and positive energy) in mothers and their adult daughters. Subjects ranged in age from 25 to 70 years. The researcher used an ex post facto correlational design. The conceptual framework was derived from Bowen's family theory and Bowlby's attachment theory. Eighty-three mother-daughter dyads responded to questionnaires which elicited data about their psychosocial status, level of attachment to each other, level of differentiation of self, positive energy, and dysphoria. Mental health outcomes were within normal range for mothers and daughters. Paired t-tests revealed similarities in mothers' and daughters' positive energy, dysphoria, and levels of attachment. Mothers scored significantly higher than daughters on differentiation of self, although data from the combined subsets did not reveal a correlation between age and self.

FAMILY SATISFACTION WITH PALLIATIVE CARE: A TEST OF FOUR ALTERNATIVE THEORIES,Linda Joan Kristjanson,mental_health,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268482W,/authors/OL5360192A/Linda_Joan_Kristjanson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 188,"The experience of dealing with end-stage cancer in a family member has been reported to be stressful. One source of stress experienced by family members may be dissatisfaction with care received by the patient and themselves. For health professionals to provide care that promotes family satisfaction, it is essential to measure this phenomenon and understand the elements that contribute to satisfaction.  An examination of the literature revealed four competing explanatory theories of satisfaction, none of which has solid empirical support. Moreover, these theories had not been tested with families or those experiencing cancer care in particular. Therefore, the aim of this research was to test these alternative theories using theoretical and empirical modeling with the expectation that a useful model would be identified to guide clinical practice of families in terminal care situations. The theories tested were: (1) Vroom's Fulfillment Theory, (2) Porter's Discrepancy Theory, (3) Thibaut and Kelley's Social Comparison Theory, and (4) Ajzen and Fishbein's Expectancy Value Theory.  A correlational design with a causal modeling methodology was used. One hundred and nine family members of patients with advanced cancer were obtained from three different palliative care services. Five instruments were used to collect data: (1) FAMCARE Scale, (2) F-Care Needs Scale, (3) F-Care Expectations Scale, (4) F-Care Perceptions Scale, and (5) a short demographic questionnaire. Data analysis included use of descriptive statistics to summarize the sample in terms of demographic variables, reliability and validity testing of the instruments, and theoretical and empirical model testing using multiple regression techniques and residual analysis.  Of the four theories tested, Discrepancy theory was the most credible, accounting for 68 percent of explained variance in family care satisfaction. Empirical modeling resulted in identification of the Family Care Satisfaction Model, which explained 78 percent of the variance in care satisfaction. Implications for theory construction and clinical practice are presented and recommendations for further research offered.  The family constitutes perhaps the most important social context within which health and illness occur. As more families are required to care for dependent or ill members at home, understanding the needs, expectations, and satisfactions with care experienced by families will become increasingly important.

NURSING AS CREATION OF THEATER: IMPROVISING WOMEN'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE,Christine Ann Madsen,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278153W,/authors/OL5367581A/Christine_Ann_Madsen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 158,"Women hospitalized for the treatment of mental health problems in public hospitals with male patients may require nursing care that deeply respects woman-centered experience. This care can model a journey of transformation that moves the nurse and the women beyond some of the borders/barriers of their past experiences.  This investigation is rooted in the creative personality of the nurse scholar. It develops the metaphor of women's healing as theater/play. The nurse in the role of director/choreographer creates a manner of listening to the individual woman patient's story as if she were critiquing her part in a play. The investigation applies radical feminist philosopher Mary Daly's images of a woman's breakthrough into personal freedom as a ""Metapatriarchal Journey"". It expands nurse ethicist Sally Gadow's image of the nurse as explorer, traveling with the person seeking care in the ""uncharted land"" of her experience.  This work attempts to apply a feminist esthetic to nursing women in acute care mental health settings. It focuses on transforming into theater the work involved in both the nursing care on the hospital unit and the writing of the dissertation. The power of women's energy shifts consciousness, using imagination to free the nurse from some traditional barriers of the patriarchal medical/psychiatric system.  Three women patients are presented in their own experience within the theater metaphor that portrays them rehearsing different roles in a play that might be called ""Healing on the Metapatriarchal Journey"". The often brutal reality of the mental health crises in their lives is presented in contrasts as a combination of medical and demographic data from hospital records and scenes of audiotaped conversations with the nurse written as play script. She uses her creativity as the key intervention in directing a journey of mutual healing.  Applications to in-patient care include in-service for nurses and patients on the oppression of traditional female socialization and creative efforts to help the woman patient rediscover her own voice. Applications to nursing education include helping students use imagination and creative writing to hear and value the integrity of the woman's story.

Do you routinely reach for caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, or sugary snacks to get you through the day? Unfortunately, the quick fixes we have become accustomed to don't work long-term, and often contribute further to the underlying problems of fatigue, depression, brain fog, and anxiety.In Natural Highs, two leading authorities in psychology and nutrition present a prescriptive breakthrough program based on nutritional supplements, herbs, and simple mind-body therapies that will help to increase energy, sharpen the mind, elevate mood, relax the body, and beat stress. Their remarkable research shows how to formulate the perfect ""brainfood"" to improve how we think and feel, resulting in a greater sense of connection and joy in everyday life-the natural high.

Sociologists, therapists, and psychiatrists have spent entire careers investigating the ins and outs of family dynamics, yet their findings are inaccessible to ordinary people, hidden in obscure journals to be shared with other experts. Now, David Niven, the international bestselling author of The 100 Simple Secret series has collected the most current and significant data from more than a thousand of the best scientific studies on families and then spelled out the findings in plain English.The advice is based not on one person's unique experiences or opinions, but offers for the first time the research of noted scientists studying average American families. These findings have been boiled down to one hundred essential ways to find and maintain love, joy, and satisfaction in all family relationships. Each statistic is accompanied by a true story about a real family showing the results in action.Don't Forget the Past: Parents who share stories of family history with their children create higher levels of concern for family members and increase the likelihood of their children's happiness.No Price Tag: Once basic necessities are met, the increasing economic status of one's family has zero effect on the likelihood of feeling satisfied with life.Let Every Opinion Be Heard: Senior citizens having trouble living in their own homes are 84 percent more likely to be satisfied with their housing situation if they feel as if their concerns are an important part of selecting a new home or facility.The Greatest Gift: Life satisfaction is 72 percent more likely among those who feel content with their family life.

Odder still, she reveals that she's suffering from a persistent memory problem. Routinely, she ""loses"" parts of her day, finding herself in places she doesn't remember going to or being told about conversations she doesn't remember having. Her problems are so pervasive that she often feels like an impersonator in her own life; she doesn't recognize the people who call themselves her friends, and she can't even remember being intimate with her own husband. Baer recognizes that Karen is on the verge of suicide and, while trying various medications to keep her alive, attempts to discover the root cause of her strange complaints. It's the work of months, and then years, to gain Karen's trust and learn the true extent of the trauma buried in her past. What she eventually reveals is nearly beyond belief, a narrative of a childhood spent grappling with unimaginable horror. How has Karen survived with even a tenuous grasp on sanity?Then Baer receives an envelope in the mail. It's marked with Karen's return address but contains a letter from a little girl who writes that she's seven years old and lives inside of Karen. Soon Baer receives letters from others claiming to be parts of Karen. Under hypnosis, these alternate Karen personalities reveal themselves in shocking variety and with undeniable traits--both physical and psychological. One ""alter"" is a young boy filled with frightening aggression; another an adult male who considers himself Karen's protector; and a third a sassy flirt who seeks dominance over the others. It's only by compartmentalizing her pain, guilt, and fear in this fashion--by ""switching time"" with alternate selves as the situation warrants--that Karen has been able to function since childhood.Realizing that his patient represents an extreme case of multiple personality disorder, Baer faces the daunting task of creating a therapy that will make Karen whole again. Somehow, in fact, he must gain the trust of each of Karen's seventeen ""alters"" and convince them of the necessity of their own annihilation.As powerful as Sybil or The Three Faces of Eve, Switching Time is the first complete account of such therapy to be told from the perspective of the treating physician, a stunningly devoted healer who worked selflessly for decades so that Karen could one day live as a single human being.From the Hardcover edition.

THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THERAPEUTIC USE OF SELF WITH ADDICTED CLIENTS IN EARLY RECOVERY: THE EXPERT NURSES'S PERSPECTIVE,Marion Conti-O'Hare,mental_health,First published in 1995,/works/OL9502009W,/authors/OL3514431A/Marion_Conti-O'Hare,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 222,"The present study aimed to investigate therapeutic use of self, a phenomenon fundamental to the practice of addictions nursing, not previously studied extensively in clinical practice. Since addictions nurses rely heavily upon therapeutic communication, therapeutic use of self represents an important area for inquiry.  Settings such as inpatient substance abuse units provide an arena for examining the nurse's response to maladaptive interpersonal coping styles exhibited by addicted clients in early recovery. This period may present special challenges for nurses who interact with clients because of the difficulty for the latter to cope initially without addicting chemicals.  Critical Incidents, interviews, field notes, and demographic questionnaires were used to elicit descriptions of clinical practice from a purposeful sample of five expert addictions nurses. Giorgi's (1985) phenomenological methodology for data analysis was employed.  Five major themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) collaborating with others to form a therapeutic system, (2) presencing oneself, (3) personal knowing through reflection, (4) empathizing through shared personal trauma and recovery and (5) making a difference through mutual growth and development. Subthemes included risking self, establishing and maintaining boundaries, establishing mutual trust and modeling recovery.  It was concluded that therapeutic use of self with the addicted client in early recovery is holistic, existential and interpersonal in nature, facilitated through the characteristics explicated in the study themes. Discussion of the themes also examined the potential for less than therapeutic outcomes with addicted clients. It was also noted that therapeutic use of self depends upon the nurse's attention to her own growth and development, and that the trauma experienced within dysfunctional family systems has a profound effect upon therapeutic use of self.

PARENTING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES,Barbara Schoen Johnson,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL8075468W,/authors/OL2688419A/Barbara_Schoen_Johnson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 168,"The study was a qualitative approach to the parenting of children with physical disabilities. Participants in the study were mothers of preschool and elementary school-age children with a physical disability of mild to moderate degree of impairment and who were mainstreamed into normal classrooms and usual childhood activities such as sports, Scouts, and neighborhood play.  The participants in the study were asked, by means of a nonscheduled standardized telephone interview, what they were doing well and ""not well"" in parenting their disabled child, what difficult experiences they had encountered, how they were preparing their child for the questions or teasing of other children, what they were doing to encourage their child's social skills, how they were handling discipline and nurturing issues, and how they were teaching their child new skills. In addition, they were asked to give their overall perception of themselves as parents and to comment on anything they wished to add regarding the rearing of a child with a disability which the interviewer had not mentioned.  The parents' responses were taped, transcribed, and then analyzed according to grounded theory methodology. The data concepts collapsed into the categories of goals for the child, communicating to the child, interacting with the child, seeking help for the child and themselves, dealing with their own feelings as parents, parental regrets, and advice for other parents. From these categories emerged the core variable, parental straddling, which occurred on three levels: (a) parents were living in the past, that is, the preoccupation with the child's birth, diagnosis, and developmental milestones, and dealing with the day-to-day present, the additional challenges of parenting a child with disability; (b) parents were dealing simultaneously with the child's and their own feelings and issues; and (c) parents were striving for an ideal position of viewing and treating the child and helping him or her see himself or herself as ""normal"" when the child was not ""normal"" as evidenced by his or her involvement with therapies, doctors, and special education. The core variable, parental straddling, was diagrammed and discussed as a component of parents' coping with rearing a child with a disability.

FAMILY HEALTH IN THE FAMILIES OF THE YOUNG CHRONICALLY MENTALLY ILL,Mary Molewyk Doornbos,mental_health,First published in 1993,/works/OL8417292W,/authors/OL2808812A/Mary_Molewyk_Doornbos,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 194,"Although the family plays a major role in the care of young adults with serious and persistent mental illness, there has been limited research on the impact of these ongoing caregiving responsibilities on the health of the family unit itself. The specific objective of the study was to explore the relationship of family stressors, family coping, family perception of the client's level of health, and time since diagnosis of mental illness to the outcome of family health. In so doing, it also sought to empirically test a middle range theory that was deduced from King's Open System's Model.  A predictive, correlational, theory testing, survey design was used. Eighty-two families were obtained by means of a nonprobability sampling strategy. Families were sought from a community mental health agency, public and private psychiatric hospitals, and support groups. Family stressors was measured by the FILE (McCubbin et al, 1983), family coping by the F-COPES (McCubbin et al, 1981), family perception of the client's level of health by the PES (Ihilevich et al, 1981), and family health by the Cohesion and Adaptability scales of the FACES III (Olson et al, 1985), the Family APGAR (Smilkstein et al, 1982), and the FES Conflict scale (Moos, 1981).  Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, multiple correlation, and multiple regression were used to address the hypotheses and research questions. The results provided empirical support, with some modifications, for the middle range theory of family health in the families of the young chronically mentally ill. In addition, family stressors, family coping, and several demographic variables were found to be significant predictors of family health.  The results of this study contributed to both the science and practice of nursing. The science of nursing was advanced by means of the empirical testing of a middle range theory. This study also constituted an initial step toward the long term goal of theory based and experientially verified nursing care for families who have a young adult with a serious mental illness. Such nursing care will enhance the profession's ability to promote health within these vulnerable family units.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The following variables predicted by Peplau's theory to be related to development of the therapeutic nurse-client relationship were examined: nurses' preconceptions of their clients, clients' preconceptions of their nurses, other interpersonal relationships of clients and nurses, and anxiety of clients and nurses. Variables were measured for both nurses and clients at 0, 3 and 6 months into their relationship.  Preconceptions of both clients and nurses were related to the duration of the orientation phase and development of the therapeutic alliance. There was support for the importance of other interpersonal relationships with clients but not nurses. Anxiety was not found to be significantly related to the development of the therapeutic relationship. Findings therefore support some tenets of Peplau's theory, but not others. This gives direction for future research and theory refinement.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

A variety of highly experienced dramatherapists, educational psychologists and childhood experts discuss the benefits to the children and young people, and also in relation to the involvement of teachers, the multi-disciplinary team and families, This professional book offers a panoramic view to explain how through dramatherapy children and young people develop their communication skills, sociability and their actual desire to learn. Detailed case studies demonstrate individual successes in youngsters experiencing a range of emotional difficulties and psychological needs. These studies include: conquering a fear of maths; violent behaviour transformed into educational achievement; safe expression of feelings for a sexually abused child; and where children are diagnosed with mental health disorders such as ADHD and ODD, where the benefits of dramatherapy with children and families are carefully described and evaluated, suggesting that this therapeutic discipline can achieve positive outcomes. The practical advice and inspirational results included here promote a future direction of integration and collaboration of school staff, multi-disciplinary teams and families. Education and equality are high on the agenda, and the function of dramatherapy is not just as a treatment, but as an economically viable and valuable preventive therapy.

In this breakthrough view of mind, body and spirit, Caroline Myss demonstrates that the seven stages through which everyone must pass in the search for consciousness and spiritual maturity are the same in all traditions and are also the same seven stages for healing.During her many years of research into the power centres of the body, Myss has uncovered strong evidence that each illness we develop corresponds to a very specific pattern of emotional and psychological stress and that certain beliefs and attitudes influence corresponding areas of the human body. For example, fears regarding financial stress affect the health of the lower back; emotional barriers to experiencing love undermine the health of the heart. A strong need to control others or your environment influences the health of the sexual area of your body. Caroline also discusses in depth why people do not heal and the reasons why we often find ourselves in difficult circumstances that never seem to change.

The reaction by parents, teachers, and peers to our own actions often determines our sense of self--how confident we feel and how secure we are about our place in the world. When self-blame and pessimism begin to overtake self-esteem and optimism, the result may be emotional, physical, and spiritual distress. In Guilt Is the Teacher, Love Is the Lesson, Dr. Joan Borysenko, a Harvard Ph.D., explores this mind/body connection as she offers personal and professional advice for journeying toward recovery and self-love. Here at last is an insightful and uplifting approach for turning the teachings of guilt into the lessons of love.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a ""parallel universe"" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl, Interrupted is a clear-sighted, unflinching document that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and recovery.

To date, most research in the field of traumatic stress has focused on neurobiological, psychological and social factors associated with trauma-related psychopathology and deficits in psychosocial functioning. Far less is known about resilience to stress and healthy adaptation to stress and trauma. This book brings together experts from a broad array of scientific fields whose research has focused on adaptive responses to stress. Each of the five sections in the book examines the relevant concepts, spanning from factors that contribute to and promote resilience, to populations and societal systems in which resilience is employed, to specific applications and contexts of resilience and interventions designed to better enhance resilience. This will be suitable for clinicians and researchers who are interested in resilience across the lifespan and in response to a wide variety of stressors""--Provided by publisher.

She is also one of its survivors.  And it is this dual perspective -- as healer and healed -- that makes Jamison's memoir so lucid, learned, and profoundly affecting.Even as she was pursuing her psychiatric training, Jamison found herself succumbing to the exhilarating highs and paralyzing lows that afflicted many of her patients. Though the disorder brought her seemingly boundless energy and mercurial creativity, it also propelled her into spending sprees, episodes of violence, and an attempt at suicide.  Powerfully candid, exceptionally wise, An Unquiet Mind is one of those rare books that has the power to transform lives -- and even save them.From the Trade Paperback edition.

How does one 'learn' to be a mother? Does having babies have anything to do with sex? At a time when mothers are bombarded by prescriptive and contradicting advice on how to behave with their children, The Maternal Lineage highlights various psychological aspects of the mothering experience. International contributors provide clinical examples of frequent and challenging situations that have received scarce attention in psychoanalysis, such as issues of neglect and psychical abuse. The transgenerational repetition from mother to daughter of distressing mothering patterns is evident throughout the book, and may seem inevitable, however clinical examples and theoretical research indicate that, when the support of partner and friends is not enough, the cycle can be brought to an end if the mother receives psychoanalytic-informed professional help. The Maternal Lineage is divided into four parts, covering: - A review of the literature focusing the mother-daughter relationship - Pregnancy and very early issues - Sub-fertility and its effects on a woman's psyche - The psychological aspects of major mothering problems: miscarriages, post-natal depression, adolescent motherhood This timely book will be of value to Psychoanalysts, Psychotherapists and Health professionals - Obstetricians, Psychiatrists, Midwives and Social workers""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Victor, who is two and a half years old, has lost his mother and younger brother in a car accident. He is 'sunny and happy' and does not cry. He is a child in deep crisis and comes for a crisis therapy. In this book we will follow Victor for his fifteen treatment sessions. He shows through play and activities how he is followed and piloted through his grief by his therapist. The healing by play therapy is depicted in words and pictures out of the perspective of both patient and therapist. The crisis therapy will work as the first link into a new future. In spite of the tragic reasons for the meetings, A Big and a Little One is Gone is a documentary story which brings both hope and courage.""--Provided by publisher.

But what exactly do they mean by depression? A chemical imbalance in the brain? A consequence of over-stimulation and overload in the Internet age? Or is depression an inescapable aspect of the human condition? Many millions of people, including children, take prescribed antidepressant drugs, the sales of which generate billions in revenue for the companies that make them. But, as Dr Weil displays in his landmark book Spontaneous Happiness, there is a new field of Integrative Mental Health that is beginning to recognise that drugs are not the sole option for treating such emotional disorders. Spontaneous Happinessis a decisive answer to the deluge of poor information in the popular media about depression - which may soon become the most significant disease of the twentieth century - and the sourcebook for a new paradigm of mental health treatment.

The same can be said of the economic challenges posed by the stress-reactive cycles of boom and bust, driven by addictive greed and compulsive panic. As current research opens up new horizons of stress-cessation, empathic intelligence, peak performance, and shared happiness, it has also encountered Asian methods of self-healing and self-transformation more effective and teachable than any known in the West. Sustainable Happiness is the first book to make Asia's most rigorous and complete system of contemplative living, hidden for centuries in Tibet, accessible to help us all on our shared journey towards sustainable wellbeing, altruism, inspiration and happiness""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Desiring to create a context where black females could both work on their individual efforts for self-actualization while remaining connected to a larger world of collective struggle, hooks articulates the link between self-recovery and political resistance. Both an expression of the joy of self-healing and the need to be ever vigilant in the struggle for equality, Sisters of the Yam continues to speak to the experience of black womanhood.

I am merely a person going through my own mental and emotional health journey, hoping that I can pass on some of the wisdom and tools that I'd been blessed enough to learn along the way. And I truly believe that if we can help heal the hearts and minds of everyone on earth, we will solve every other problem known to man in the process. -- Zachary Levi  Radical Love is the debut memoir from Zachary Levi (Shazam!, American Underdog, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Chuck), which shares his emotional journey through a lifetime of crippling anxiety and depression to find joy, gratitude, and ultimate purpose. Facing the scars of childhood trauma and the voices in his head that told him he would never be enough, Zac recounts the raw yet honest behind-the-scenes story of his family life, career successes, and the personal disappointments that led him to rock bottom and landed him in a therapy center, where he learned to address the underlying issues that preceded his downward spiral.  Radical Love combines witty, touching, and powerful commentary with relatable illustrations to help you on your own path toward mental wellness. With vulnerability and humor, Zac relates the valuable lessons and insights he’s learned so that you can rise from the ashes of trauma and pursue a meaningful life of gratitude.

It explores the use of art to survive abuse, incest, madness and depression, and the often deep-seated impulse toward self-destruction including cutting, eating disorders, and addiction. Here, some of our most compelling cartoonists, novelists, poets, dancers, playwrights, and burlesque performers traverse the pains and passions that can both motivate and destroy women artists, and mark a path for survival. Taken together, these artful reflections offer an honest and hopeful journey through a woman's silent rage, through the power inherent in struggles with destruction, and the ensuing possibilities of transforming that burning force into the external release of art.  With contributions by Nan Goldin, bell hooks, Patricia Smith, Cristy C. Road, Carol Queen, Annie Sprinkle, Elizabeth Stephens, Carolyn Gage, Eileen Myles, Fly, Diane DiMassa, Bonfire Madigan Shive, Inga Muscio, Kate Bornstein, Toni Blackman, Nicole Blackman, Silas Howard, Daphne Gottleib, and Stephanie Howell.

Perversion,Stephanie S. Swales,mental_health,First published in 2012,/works/OL16546750W,/authors/OL7092864A/Stephanie_S._Swales,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Routledge|Language English,"""Lacan's psychoanalytic take on what makes a pervert perverse is not the fact of habitually engaging in specific ""abnormal"" or transgressive sexual acts, but of occupying a particular structural position in relation to the Other. Perversion is one of Lacan's three main ontological diagnostic structures, structures that indicate fundamentally different ways of solving the problems of alienation, separation from the primary caregiver, and castration, or having limits set by the law on one's jouissance. The perverse subject has undergone alienation but disavowed castration, suffering from excessive jouissance and a core belief that the law and social norms are fraudulent at worst and weak at best.In Perversion, Stephanie Swales provides a close reading (a qualitative hermeneutic reading) of what Lacan said about perversion and its substructures (i.e., fetishism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sadism, and masochism). Lacanian theory is carefully explained in accessible language, and perversion is elucidated in terms of its etiology, characteristics, symptoms, and fundamental fantasy. Referring to sex offenders as a sample, she offers clinicians a guide to making differential diagnoses between psychotic, neurotic, and perverse patients, and provides a treatment model for working with perversion versus neurosis. Two detailed qualitative clinical case studies are presented one of a neurotic sex offender and the other of a perverse sex offender highlighting crucial differences in the transference relation and subsequent treatment recommendations for both forensic and private practice contexts.Perversion offers a fresh psychoanalytic approach to the subject and will be of great interest to scholars and clinicians in the fields of psychoanalysis, psychology, forensic science, cultural studies, and philosophy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Morrison, Professor of Clinical Psychology, University of Manchester, UK   Over the past decade our understanding of the experience of psychosis has changed dramatically. As part of this change, a range of psychological models of psychosis and associated interventions have developed.   Staying Well After Psychosis presents an individually based psychological intervention targeting emotional recovery and relapse prevention. This approach considers the cognitive, interpersonal and developmental aspects involved in recovery and vulnerability to the recurrence of psychosis.   Andrew Gumley and Matthias Schwannauer provide a framework for recovery and staying well that focuses on emotional and interpersonal adaptation to psychosis. This practical manual covers, in detail, all aspects of the therapeutic process of Cognitive Interpersonal Therapy, including:    Taking a developmental perspective on help seeking and affect regulation.  Supporting self-reorganisation and adaptation after acute psychosis.  Understanding and treating traumatic reactions to psychosis.  Working with humiliation, entrapment, loss and fear of recurrence appraisals during recovery.  Working with cognitive interpersonal schemata.  Developing coping in an interpersonal context.     Clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and mental health professionals will find this innovative treatment manual to be a valuable resource in their work with adults and adolescents. This book will also be of interest to lecturers and students of clinical psychology and mental health.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Her obsession with her co-worker, Kurt, is just one of many coping mechanisms—like her constant shape and number rituals, or the way scenes from her favorite children’s book bleed into her vision whenever she feels anxious or stressed.  But when Katrina finds a cryptic message from Kurt that implies he’s aware of her surveillance, her tenuous hold on a normal life crumbles. Driven by compulsion, she enacts the most powerful ritual she has to reclaim control—a midnight visit to the Cayatoga Bridge—and arrives just in time to witness Kurt’s suicide. Before he jumps, he slams her with a devastating accusation: his death is all her fault.  Horrified, Katrina combs through the clues she’s collected about Kurt over the last three years, but each revelation uncovers a menacing truth: for every moment she was watching him, he was watching her. And the past she thought she’d left behind? It’s been following her more closely than she ever could have imagined.  A gripping page-turner, as well as a sensitive exploration of mental health, Liar, Dreamer, Thief is an intimate portrayal of life in all its complexities—and the dangers inherent in unveiling people’s most closely guarded secrets.

In 1978, Charles Lachenmeyer was a happily married professor of sociology who lived in the New York suburbs with his wife and nine-year-old son, Nathaniel.  But within a few short years, schizophrenia--a devastating mental illness with no known cure--would cost him everything: his sanity, his career, his family, even the roof over his head.  Upon learning of his father's death in 1995, Nathaniel set out to search for the truth behind his father's haunted, solitary existence.  Rich in imagery and poignant symbolism, The Outsider is a beautifully written memoir of a father's struggle to survive with dignity, and a son's struggle to know the father he lost to schizophrenia long before he finally lost him to death.The Outsider is a recipient of the Kenneth Johnson Memorial Research Library Book Award and is the winner of the 2000 Bell of Hope Award, presented annually by the Mental Health Association of Philadelphia to honor ""significant and far-reaching contributions benefiting those facing the challenge of mental illness.""

With less free playtime and overwhelming pressure to achieve, the kids are the ones who suffer. Investigative journalist Alissa Quart knows the terrain firsthand, having herself negotiated the gifted-child label. With phenomenal research and sharp insight, she takes a damning look at the industry that profits from marketing educational products to enhance giftedness and questions the correlation between rigorous early enrichment and higher achievement. A thoughtful, sometimes critical look at the excessive ambition foisted upon children, Hothouse Kids is essential reading for parents, teachers, and anyone concerned about education.

It emphasizes the need to look inward and listen to the messages which are channelled through our beings, rather than dismiss these experiences as some form of ""disorder"".   Part One considers spirituality as a reflection of the process of change. A brief overview of the contemporary history of spiritual inquiry in the field of mental health is provided.   Part Two considers spirituality as a reflection of the process of meaning making.   Part Three considers spirituality in terms of different forms of journey, including a consideration of the traditional concept of pilgrimage. Part Four considers the potential for healing that lies within even the most terrifying forms of madness. The book then concludes with a suggestion of the power of ""waiting"" and the rewards obtained by the careful, compassionate practice of life.

While we accept that stress or anxiety can damage our health, the idea of ""healing thoughts"" was long ago hijacked by New Age gurus and spiritual healers. Recently, however, serious scientists from a range of fields have been uncovering evidence that our thoughts, emotions, and beliefs can ease pain, heal wounds, fend off infection and heart disease, even slow the progression of AIDS and some cancers. In Cure, award-winning science writer Jo Marchant travels the world to meet the physicians, patients, and researchers on the cutting edge of this new world of medicine. We learn how meditation protects against depression and dementia, how social connections increase life expectancy, and how patients who feel cared for recover from surgery faster. We meet Iraq war veterans who are using a virtual arctic world to treat their burns and children whose ADHD is kept under control with half the normal dose of medication. We watch as a transplant patient uses the smell of lavender to calm his hostile immune system and an Olympic runner shaves vital seconds off his time through mind-power alone. Drawing on the very latest research, Marchant explores the vast potential of the mind's ability to heal, acknowledges its limitations, and explains how we can make use of the findings in our own lives""-- Provided by publisher.

The book you hold in your hands (or perhaps view on your Kindle e-reader) encompasses an array of topics almost unimaginable even 25 years ago. It covers the roles and responsibilities of government and nongovernmental organizations and the integration of behavioral health into public health preparedness and response. There are separate chapters on children, adolescents, older adults, and racially and ethnically diverse populations. Other chapters address secondary trauma in disaster workers and assessing local disaster vulnerability. The list goes on, including dealing with school systems, long-term care, behavioral health in shelters, treatment for disaster survivors, disaster substance abuse services, culturally competent case management, response team training, and building community resilience. A simple perusal of the table of contents serves as an illustration of the way that attention to disaster behavioral health has grown exponentially in research, policy, and practice communities. It was not always so. When I began graduate training in the mid 1980s, to my knowledge disaster mental health was not part of any graduate school curriculum. A small subset of clinical psychologists and other mental health professionals had some training in crisis mental health, but it was optional, and it carried a different and much more specifi c meaning. Crisis mental health in those days typically meant: (1) working with people who were in acute crisis, (2) working with victims of extreme circumstances using models derived from the military and trauma research, and/or (3) community crisis intervention""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Psychiatrists typically receive the most thorough training in its diagnosis, but the diagnosis of psychosis secondary to nonpsychiatric conditions is not often emphasized. An understanding of the underlying cause of psychosis is important for effective management. The Diagnosis of Psychosis bridges the gap between psychiatry and medicine, providing a comprehensive review of primary and secondary causes of psychosis. It covers both common and rare causes in a clinically focused guide. Useful both for teaching and reference, the text covers physical and mental state examination, describes key investigations, and summarizes the non-psychiatric features of medical conditions causing psychosis. Particularly relevant for psychiatrists and trainees in psychiatry, this volume will also assist neurologists and general physicians who encounter psychosis in their practice""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Moving coast to coast, she tries to escape her self-hatred and obsession by never slowing down, unaware that she is caught in downward spiral emotionally, spiritually, and physically. Finally she can no longer deny that she will die if she doesn't get help, overcome her shame, and conquer her addiction. But seeking help only reinforces her negative self-image, and she discovers her race makes her an oddity in the all-white programs for eating disorders. This memoir of her experiences answers many questions about why black women often do not seek traditional therapy for emotional problems.

Raised in an idyllic creative environment, mom and dad cultivating his talent, Issa watches his family's descent into chaos in the drug-crazed late 1980s. Following his father's death, Issa, grief-stricken and vulnerable, travels down a road that leads to psychosis--and to one of the most nightmarish scenarios conceivable. Issa receives the insanity plea and is committed to an insane asylum with no release date. But that is only the beginning of his odyssey. Institutional and sexual sins cause further punishments, culminating in a heated legal battle for freedom. Written with great verve and immediacy,The Hospital Always Wins paints a detailed picture of a broken mental health system but also reveals the power of art, when nurtured in a benign environment, to provide a resource for recovery. Ultimately this is a story about survival and atonement through creativity and courage against almost insurmountable odds""--  ""Issa Ibrahim's memoir details in searing prose his development of severe mental illness leading to the accidental killing of his mother, his acquittal by reason of insanity, and his subsequent commission to a mental hospital for nearly twenty years""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this entertaining and inspiring book, Jedediah Bila chronicles her confusing, chaotic, and ultimately catastrophic love-hate relationship with her cell phone. Taking us through a series of what she calls her McFly Moments (named for the Back to the Future protagonist who sparked her simple life envy and desire to travel back to a seemingly easier time), Jedediah shares her most personal and embarrassing stories of mistakes made and sunsets missed, including the upending, life-altering months swirling in the digitally-enabled double life of her con man ex-boyfriend. Naming her affliction OCTD, (Obsessive Compulsive Tech Disorder) and heeding what she calls 'the seven deadly signs that the tech apocalypse is upon us,' Bila sets off to explore the consequences of too-much-tech, including: public cell-phone conversations as the second-hand smoke of the twenty-first century; Menage-a-Tech relationships; and the fact that we've all been programmed for addiction. Jedediah Bila applies the no-nonsense, common-sense, personal responsibility and accountability approach on which her television viewership, readers, and more than 400,000 social media followers have come to rely, to shout 'Hey! My eyes are up here' and warn us all that if we don't start looking up to make eye contact with each other, our very humanity is at stake""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A range of 50 chapters integrates current research, scholarship, and practice on the risks and protective factors that influence women's health and well-being across the life span. Within and biopsychosocial framework, the Handbook explores mind and body, risks and resilience, research and interventions, cultural diversity, and public policy."" ""This Handbook underscores the importance of gender in the lives of girls and women developmentally across significant phases of the life span. Considering the importance of cultural context, this book illustrates how gender socialization in female development and behavior affects self-evaluation, identity processes, and the social roles that girls and women adopt. Its chapters illustrate how externally induced risks such as poverty, discrimination, and violence present challenges to healthy development. Significantly, the chapters also draw attention to long overlooked and compelling strengths and capacities that provide a firm basis for growth and health.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Presented from a sociological rather than a psychological perspective, this book seeks to provide readers with an extensive but accessible look at its history, the current mental health treatment modalities, the various mental health practitioners, the different conditions known as mental health disorders, as well as strategies for improving the system. Trained both in clinical and applied therapy and sociology, the author aims to provide a balance to the work that other books on mental health often lack. As a result, this book proposes a dual approach to the study of mental health. Dr. Steverson acknowledges that while disorders and treatment modalities require a micro-level (intrapsychic) approach, the overall analysis of the mental health system demands a macro-level (sociological) approach. Due to the recent changes in the American healthcare system and the concerns this has raised, this book is a necessary and important contribution to its field. It also reflects a growing desire from the public to better understand this subject as mental health issues continue to gain visibility in the public eye. Free of psychological jargon and in an accessible format, this book will not only appeal to academics and students, but also to mental health consumers, their families, and people who are interested in advocacy.

As his memory begins to fail, she embarks on a quest to unravel his story, and soon finds herself in a far more consuming place than she had bargained for. Tom Carew was a maverick, a left-handed stutterer, a law unto himself. As a member of an elite SOE unit he was parachuted behind enemy lines to raise guerrilla resistance in France, then Burma, in the Second World War. But his wartime exploits are only the start of it ... Dadland is a manhunt. Keggie takes us on a spellbinding journey, in peace and war, into surprising and shady corners of history, her rackety English childhood, the poignant breakdown of her family, the corridors of dementia and beyond. As Keggie pieces Tom - and herself - back together again, she celebrates the technicolour life of an impossible, irresistible, unstoppable man.

Exploring issues covering psychological, social, and cultural aspects of mental health problems, it looks at epidemiological data that shows increased frequency in different clinical aspects of many psychiatric disorders, the biological and endocrinological concomitants of mental health, and eating disorders, perinatal psychiatric disorders, and the long term effects of abuse - helping readers to appreciate the societal, parental, and personal consequences of mental health problems.  Part one is dedicated to fundamental aspects in women's mental health. It covers topics from women's health as a global issue to different medical psychological theories, giving an overview of gender in mental health. The second examines clinical aspects of women and mental health. In part three, special clinical topics such as PTSD, self-harm, menopause, violence and its management are investigated. Part four focuses on parental psychiatric disorders, clarifying how mental health and behavioural problems in children can be a marker or consequence of maternal distress. The final two parts look at the topics of women and disability, and legislation and policy.   A book of exceptional scope and depth, it will be essential for all those health professionals involved in managing mental health problems in women""--Provided by publisher.

The Roots of the Recovery Movement in Psychiatry,Larry Davidson,mental_health,First published in 2010,/works/OL15186917W,/authors/OL2847362A/Larry_Davidson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24319011M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2010|Publisher  John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.,              John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|Language English","As the global psychiatric community enters a new era of transformation, this book explores lessons learned from previous efforts with the goal of ""getting it right"" this time. In response to the common refrain that we know about and 'do' recovery already, the authors set the recovery movement within the conceptual framework of major thinkers and achievers in the history of psychiatry, such as Philippe Pinel, Dorothea Dix, Adolf Meyer, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Franco Basaglia.    The book reaches beyond the usual boundaries of psychiatry to incorporate lessons from related fields, such as psychology, sociology, social welfare, philosophy, political economic theory, and civil rights. From Jane Addams and the Settlement House movement to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gilles Deleuze, this book identifies the less well-known and less visible dimensions of the recovery concept and movement that underlie concrete clinical practice.    In addition, the authors highlight the limitations of previous efforts to reform and transform mental health practice, such as the de-institutionalization movement begun in the 1950s, in the hope that the field will not have to repeat these same mistakes. Their thoughtful analysis and valuable advice will benefit people in recovery, their loved ones, the practitioners who serve them, and society at large.

"""BRIDGING"" THERAPY IN HOSPITAL- AND COMMUNITY-BASED PSYCHIATRIC NURSING CARE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. (VOLUMES I AND II)",Nelly Ahmed Mahgoub,mental_health,First published in 1988,/works/OL12264854W,/authors/OL5357100A/Nelly_Ahmed_Mahgoub,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 686,"Available from UMI in association with The British Library.  This study presents a detailed account of Bridging Therapy--an innovative intervention aimed at providing relatively comprehensive psychiatric nursing care for mentally ill patients. Starting at hospitalisation, Bridging Therapy continues as planned nursing care based on detailed assessment of the patient's short- and longer-term needs both before and after discharge to the community, delivered where possible by the same nurse, of by members of the same nursing team. Bridging Therapy thus presents a remedial model for current fragmented patterns of nursing care, based on an eclectic approach to psychotherapy and nursing process known as the ""flexible integrative approach"" (FIA).  The study recognises problems caused by lack of patient outcome measures in psychiatric nursing; and approaches this by developing an appropriate assessment instrument, the Behaviour Adjustment Inventory (BAI), which is initially tested in concurrent use with a well-validated psychometric instrument (the GHQ); with a second well-validated instrument (the EPI) acting as an initial screening device. The BAI assesses patients' initial status on admission and subsequent responses to Bridging Therapy on a five-point scale, used in conjunction with detailed clinical criteria of behaviour and attitude change.  Clinical evaluation of patients in the contrasted contexts of Sheffield and Cairo is described. In each context, experimental (Bridging Therapy) and control (non-Bridging Therapy) groups are studied (Sheffield total N = 22: Cairo total N = 18). Assessment of initial condition was carried out on admission to hospital; recovery status on discharge, and at the close of therapeutic follow-up in the community. Results indicate similar levels of recovery for Sheffield and Cairo groups, with a more pronounced tendency to recovery in the experimental (Bridging Therapy) groups; however, this difference does not reach statistical significance.  Psychometric findings are augmented by qualitative descriptions of the implementation process. Two detailed nursing studies from each context are presented. The investigation highlights the complexity of the research problem, including important transcultural considerations; identifies multifactorial issues governing patient care; and supports further research into Bridging Therapy as a potential remedy for current gaps in psychiatric nursing care, both in Britain and Egypt. Relevant materials concerning historical/structural aspects of mental health care and varieties of psychotherapy (Chapters 1 through 3) are included because of their contextual importance both to British and Egyptian workers.

A COMPARISON OF THE WORK OF COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC NURSES AND MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL WORKERS IN SALFORD (ENGLAND),Kate Wooff,mental_health,First published in 1987,/works/OL12264197W,/authors/OL5356509A/Kate_Wooff,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1987|Pages 330,"Available from UMI in association with The British Library. Requires signed TDF.  Case register data are used to describe the basic characteristics of clients who used the community psychiatric nursing, and mental health social work services between 1976 and 1985. These data are placed in the context of psychiatric services as a whole. Observational data are used to describe the day-to-day work undertaken by the two groups of workers.  Although no statistically significant differences in the clinical categories of the clients seen were found, there were significant differences in the ways in which the two groups of workers interacted with their clients. Community psychiatric nurses were found to mainly apply a medical model of care, whilst specialist social workers were found to be mainly concerned to improve the social adjustment of their clients.  There was evidence that the considerable shift away from caring for clients in the 'schizophrenia' clinical category was associated with the community psychiatric nurses' attachment to primary care teams. It was concluded that there were considerable unmet needs for the long-term non-hospital care of this group of clients.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
"A FAMILY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND SOMATIZATION IN GRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS",Karen Marie Kleeman,mental_health,First published in 1983,/works/OL12260999W,/authors/OL5353601A/Karen_Marie_Kleeman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1983|Pages 212,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of a constellation of family variables (family stress, family resources, family coping, sibling position, family of origin history of symptoms, and extended family social support) to selected symptoms: anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Bowen Theory considers the family as an interactive system experiencing stress in varying degrees. Bowen's conceptualizations of family emotional system, chronic anxiety and symptom formation, multigenerational transmission process, sibling position, and extended family were applied to this study.  Two hundred ten (n = 210) volunteer graduate nursing students comprised the convenience sample. Each subject completed: a demographic background sheet; Family Inventory of Life Events (FILE); Family Inventory of Resources for Management (FIRM); Family Crisis Oriented Personal Scales (F-Copes); and Symptom Check List-90 Revised (SCL-90R).  Factor analysis was done on the basis of multicollinearity among the variables of interest and resulted in computations of composite factors for anxiety, depression, and somatization (renamed ""symptom experience"") and for extended family social support.  Regression analysis revealed that family stress, family resources, and family coping combined to explain 17% of the variability in symptom experience (R('2) = .17, p < .01) with family stress being the single best predictor. Extended family social support correlated weakly with symptom experience (r = -.15, p < .05) for those subjects whose parents were alive (n = 154). Family of origin history of symptoms proved to be a more important variable than hypothesized. This variable correlated moderately with symptom experience (r = .33, p < .001), being the best predictor of symptom experience in a regression analysis when compared with sibling position and extended family social support (R('2) = .11, p < .01). Extended family social support proved to be a disappointing variable, perhaps due to the use of non-Bowen tools. T-tests performed on symptom experience according to sibling position failed to show any significant differences. Additional findings included: (1) significant differences on t-testing between subjects whose parents were both alive versus subjects with one or both parents deceased on symptom experience (t = 2.91, p < .005) and family of origin history of symptoms (t = 3.94, p < .001); (2) significant correlations of subject symptom experience with all categories of family of origin history of symptoms (grandparents, r = .34, p < .001; father, r = .23, p < .001; mother, r = .21, p < .005; and siblings, r = .16, p < .05).  These findings were discussed in light of the Bowen Theory as well as other research on family systems, with suggestions for replicative studies and tool development.

His friends are used to his strict routines, like ironing his socks and lighting his fireplace every Sunday (even in the summer). His forlorn mother puts up with his strange ""no touching"" antics, even though all she wants is a hug from her son. Really, the only problem is the four monsters he has for roommates. This ragtag bunch run his life, determined to create chaos in his orderly world.  Then Rebecca, Denis's enigmatic ex-girlfriend from his former life, returns to town. Shocked to meet the new Denis--a broken man, unable to manage even the most basic social interactions--she becomes fixated on bringing back the funny, charismatic man she once loved. As Denis begins to emerge from his sheltered existence and rediscover the person he used to be, the monsters declare all-out war. Denis is finally forced to confront the demons that share his house, and his head.""--Amazon.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Chapters are both evidence-based and practical, weaving in learning objectives, review questions, and varied case examples, all of which will prepare students and professionals for the reality of working with medical cannabis consumers.—Publisher   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

From its origins in the eighteenth century to its wide scope in the early twenty-first, this search for emotional health and welfare has cost billions. In the name of mental health, millions around the world have been tranquilized, institutionalized, psycho-analyzed, sterilized, lobotomized and even euthanized. Yet at the dawn of the new millennium, reported rates of depression and anxiety are unprecedentedly high. Drawing on years of field research, Ian Dowbiggin argues that if the quest for emotional well-being has reached a crisis point in the twenty-first century, it is because mass society is enveloped by cultures of therapism and consumerism, which increasingly advocate bureaucratic and managerial approaches to health and welfare""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Life of the Heroin User: Typical Beginnings, Trajectories and Outcomes is the first book to apply a biographical approach to the lifecycle of the heroin user from birth until death. Chapters address each stage of the user's life, including childhood, routes to use, the development of dependence, problems arising from addiction, death and options for treatment and prevention. Drawing on over two decades of experience in the field of opium research, Shane Darke examines major theoretical approaches to the development of opiate dependence and the efficacy of treatment options for opiate dependence. Key points are presented at the end of each chapter. The most detailed review available of what is likely to happen to the dependent heroin user, this is an important book for clinicians, researchers and students in the fields of drug and alcohol studies and public health""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although many patients and families are aware of the physical challenges that accompany Parkinson's disease, few are prepared to deal with the common behavioral issues that impact their quality of life.Behavior problems in PD are not always catastrophic, but they are common. It is estimated that 65-90% of PD patients experience some level of depression, anxiety, dementia, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, sleep disorders, and other behavioral disorders that affect everyone involved. Written in easy-to-read language, Making the Connection Between Brain and Behavior is the only book that focuses entirely on an area that many doctors overlook, an area that often causes the most problems and can be the most treatable. The self-contained chapters will help readers understand, address, and cope with common behavioral issues, as well as provide guidance on ways to communicate with the healthcare team.

Division|Language English|Pages 336","This book provides a comprehensive review of common adult mental disorders and substance use disorders. The chapters were written by teams of researchers and clinicians, thus providing an integration of empirical findings with clinical experience. Family issues, relapse prevention, the use of self-help groups, and co-morbidity are addressed throughout since many patients have multiple disorders and relapse risk is high. In addition, this book integrates considerable information about treatment adherence, and provides the reader with helpful strategies on ways to enhance patient compliance with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, as well as strategies for increasing motivation to change. A ""recovery"" paradigm is used throughout the book that advocates the importance of helping the patient take an active role in managing his or her disorders.
