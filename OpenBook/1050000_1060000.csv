A common reason for this is the view that Němcová developed a very ""lively and modern narrative style"". At the beginning of the examination of Nemcová's narrative poetry as a scenic poetics was the observation that the author shows in the literary forms of expression she uses - letter, travel sketch, and artistic prose - a pronounced inclination to present conversations between the depicted figures. Characteristic of these conversations as directly quoted figure speech is the stylization of the speech as oral speech, so that in addition to the subject of the conversation statements, the acoustic-tonal effect of the cited voices comes to the fore.  Bis heute bezeichnen viele tschechische Schriftsteller das Werk Němcovás als Vorbild für das eigene künstlerische Arbeiten. Als häufiger Grund hierfür gilt die Auffassung, Němcová habe einen sehr ""lebendigen und modernen Erzählstil"" entwickelt. Am Anfang der Untersuchung von Němcovás Erzählpoetik als einer szenischen Poetik stand die Beobachtung, daß die Autorin in den von ihr verwendeteten literarisehen Ausdrucksformen - Brief, Reiseskizze und künstlerische Prosa - eine ausgeprägte Neigung zur Darstellung von Wechselgesprächen zwischen den dargestellten Figuren zeigt. Kennzeichnend für diese Wechselgespräche als direkt zitierte Figurenrede ist die Stilisierung der Rede als mündliche Rede, so daß neben dem Gegenstand der Gesprächsaussagen auch die akustisch-klangliche Wirkung der zitierten Stimmen in den Vordergrund tritt.

The Revival of the Russian Literary Avantgarde,Irene E. Kolchinsky,poetry,First published in 2001,/works/OL23502218W,/authors/OL1471308A/Irene_E._Kolchinsky,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 206,"This study is devoted to the authors who initiated the revival of the Russian avantgarde tradition, which had been brutally suppressed by the Soviet authorities in the mid- 1930s. The revival of this tradition took place in the literary underground, where writers who endeavored to fulfil this challenging task largely remained until the collapse of the Soviet regime. Most of them emerged from obscurity only at the beginning of the 1990s, which explains why their dramatic and fascinating history has been so little examined by scholars. Although the situation has changed significantly in the last decade, during which some insightful studies have appeared in both Russia and the West, the subject obviously requires more thorough and systematic exploration. This book aims to narrow important gaps in the scholarship on the Russian literary avantgarde during its least investigated period.

M. Iu. Lermontov. His Life and Work,Walter N. Vickery,poetry,First published in 2001,/works/OL23499929W,/authors/OL5770777A/Walter_N._Vickery,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 430,"Displaying his characteristic balance between sympathy and detachment, Vickery has first provided a concise, but richly detailed account of Lermontov's brief and tragic life. His approach is above all sensible - down-to-earth and fair. Lermontov was a romantic, really the only Russian poet who fully fits that designation. Vickery understands very well the romantic ethos, but he is no romantic him self. He treats with tolerant but ironic amusement the adolescent posturing of Lermontov's early Byronism. He is less tolerant of the frequent arrogance and even cruelty in Lermontov's behavior toward those close to him, especially women. On the other hand, Vickery recognizes Lermontov's genuine longing for intimacy and affection and credits his capacity for friendship and generosity. He also effectively traces all these conflicting im pulses in Lermontov's poetry.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why has this ancient craft existed throughout time, continuing even into our fast-paced age of moderncy and technology?

He has the unique ability to show, through his words, how beautifully complicated, yet amazingly simple, life can be. He has an appreciation for the light, happy sides of life, while not fearing to show his darkest depths and pain. Protege of Vagabonds discusses heavenly joy in something as simple as a special meal in Nothing for me, but lobster, please, and juxtaposes it with the melancholy, Browned eyed lifesaver. It also showcases his love for humor in the lyrical, almost ridiculous poem, Lone madrone country club. Chip loves life, all of life's emotions, and everything and everyone who comes with it. Poet, traveler, and somewhat of an anomaly, Chip Thomson, truly embraces a life on his own terms, and tributes his writing to Jimmy Buffett and Don Blanding -- even if he does accelerate the Margaritaville lifestyle a bit. Much of his inspiration comes from some of his favorite songs, including: Jerry Jeff Walker's Contrary of ordinary, Wilie Nelson's On the road again, Edwin McCain's Kitchen song, and Jimmy Buffett's Migration. Each song influences Chip differently and with him, only one thing stays the same, change.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

More accurately, this book presents a range of voices—in some of the multi-sectioned poems, a choir—as Shetty writes through a variety of personae and perspectives, delivering emotionally resonant deep imagery and intellectual precision, profound compassion and ironic wit, in equal parts. In Shetty’s work the natural world impinges on domestic life at every turn, creating an environment transformed through contact as well as the poet’s observation: a spider becomes “a yoyo,/A jiggling asterisk: a footnote:” and even on the bookshelves silverfish “burrow in flaking tomes.” A meditation on “the sick warmth of self-induced pain” finds its antiphone elsewhere in the “strange gawky cackle” of a peacock, “in its beak a fullgrown/Krait, slick hexagonal scales/Panicky and porous.” And running throughout the course of this brilliant career is a weighted humour, whether Shetty is recounting the secrets to a happy life offered by various characters (“external is eternal,” one handsome man concludes, while another urges simply, “Drink. Siesta.”) or mourning the changes at home, where, “with the children gone…MySpace and Facebook/do not twitter/all day long.” This collection provides us with a broad survey of a celebrated poet’s past and present while offering an enticement for his—and our—future.’—John Hennessy, poetry editor of The Common   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Autor de temáticas universales, Jorge Valdés cultiva una poesía apegada a las formas clásicas a través de las cuales ha ido experimentando hasta alcanzar una deslumbrante madurez poética.  La editorial cántabra Quálea Editorial publica en primicia el poemario Otras horas, el último libro del escritor y diplomático mexicano Jorge Valdés Díaz-Vélez (Torreón, México, 1955), autor que cuenta entre sus galardones el prestigioso Premio Internacional de Poesía Miguel Hernández- Comunidad Valenciana 2007. __La obra constituye el quinto título de la colección de poesía de la editorial que, bajo la dirección de los poetas Rafael Fombellida y Carlos Alcorta, continúa con su labor de acercar al público lector las obras y los autores más prestigiosos de la lírica contemporánea internacional. Otras horas supone también una novedad destacada: su inclusión inaugura la presencia de las voces en castellano en una línea editorial que ya había acogido entre sus publicaciones, siempre en ediciones bilingües, el idioma inglés, el italiano y el portugués. El esmerado diseño y acabado del libro como objeto constituyen uno de sus sellos reconocibles y ya cuentan con el reconocimiento crítico y lector, como acredita el reciente galardón recibido al Mejor Diseño de Colección que otorga anualmente la Revista Visual y que pasa por ser uno de los de mayor prestigio a nivel nacional. Este poemario se presenta al público como una nueva consagración lírica de Jorge Valdés Díaz-Vélez, y continúa el camino de excelencia y madurez formal que ya exhibió en sus dos anteriores títulos que le han convertido, por méritos propios, en uno de los nombres de referencia de la poesía en castellano. Autor de temáticas universales, Jorge Valdés cultiva una poesía apegada a las formas clásicas a través de las cuales ha ido experimentando hasta alcanzar una deslumbrante madurez poética. Traducido al francés, italiano, neerlandés, portugués, rumano e inglés, es autor de once libros de poesía; los más recientes son Los Alebrijes (Madrid, Hiperión, 2007), por el que recibió el prestigioso Premio Internacional de Poesía Miguel Hernández-Comunidad Valenciana 2007, Tiempo fuera (1988-2005) (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 2007) y Qualcuno va (Ed. Bilingüe italiano-español, Foggia, Bari, Sentieri Meridiani Edizioni, 2010). Está incluido en las más relevantes antologías de poesía mexicana publicadas en Bélgica, Colombia, España, Inglaterra, Italia y México; entre otras, en La poesía del Siglo XX en México (Madrid, Visor, 2009). Se le han otorgado también el Premio Latinoamericano Plural (1985) y el Premio Nacional de Poesía Aguascalientes (1998). Ha ejercido como diplomático en las embajadas de México en Argentina, Costa Rica, Cuba y España, y en el Consulado General en Miami (Estados Unidos de América), donde ha desempeñado cargos de Consejero Cultural. También ha sido Director del Centro Cultural de México.  En las páginas de Otras horas Jorge Valdés mantiene un pulcro trabajo de cincelado de la palabra al servicio de unos versos medidos, cadenciosos, en los que no sobra una palabra y que se integran en una colección poética que hermana el esplendor de las antiguas formas clásicas del soneto con la economía de los tannkas japoneses, todo en un coherente universo lírico donde se agitan las temáticas universales: los cuatro elementos; las coordenadas de espacio y tiempo; la nostalgia y la esperanza; el recuerdo y el olvido; la música y el silencio; las certezas, las pérdidas, las distancias y el amor, dan fondo y forma a un conjunto de poemas donde la poesía resplandece a la luz de la belleza, el arte y la vida y sus misterios. En justicia cabría considerar la poesía de Jorge Valdés de “transitable”. En un tiempo en que la criptografía, el collage y el puzzle parecen adueñarse de los espacios poéticos españoles, el poeta de Coahuila exhibe una propuesta lírica que dialoga permanentemente con la tradición y con los clásicos de nuestra lengua, logrando un perfecto engarce entre sentido y forma, entre sonido y sustancia, que le ha llevado a ocupar un lugar preeminente en la ya de por sí alta poesía de su país natal, una de las más ricas del idioma. La competencia poética de Jorge Valdés se revela en la prodigalidad y originalidad de sus metáforas, en su grado de adecuación a un universo visual y verbal plenamente contemporáneo, y en su capacidad para renovar referentes simbólicos. Propone pues Valdés un discurso mediante el cual el lector conserva la opción de transitar a través de su experiencia escritora obviando el desengaño de la impermeabilidad, pero expuesto siempre a ser alcanzado por lo inesperado, lo infrecuente, la sorpresa plástica o la profundidad de sentido. Se adentra Jorge Valdés en los senderos de la experiencia totalizando un conjunto poético en el cual su maestría compositiva potencia la intensidad de un discurso articulado en base a poemas que operan a modo bien de conversación reflexiva y culta, con ávida exploración introspectiva y fluidez rítmica, bien a modo de sketches visuales o sensoriales en los cuales la condensación de la tannka abre y libera un núcleo fulgente de sensualidad e inédita emoción. _   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet Ersatz Anatomy is full of presences of all kinds—black walnuts cracked between bricks, dead or foundering alewives, Einstein and Longinus resurrected, Drepung Tehor Monks surfacing unexpectedly in rural Pennsylvania, and the dead Christ crashing into the same world as a transformed and living Caliban.  Sherrill’s poetic gifts are considerable, but it’s his imagination that opens the backdoor to the attic of the world and allows us to crawl in.  As the poet unflinchingly asserts, ‘This is not an apology,’ and with that backhanded blessing we are absolved of any need to ask for forgiveness for the joy and wonder and pain these poems will bring in their reading.  But one note of caution: the poet means it when he says, ‘I’ll show you everything / if you don’t stop me.’”—Todd Davis   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Franz Douskey's insights are uniquely his, his voice direct and his imagination meteoric. Douskey has lived long and large. He has published in Rolling Stone, the Nation, The New York Quarterly, The New Yorker and Las Vegas Life. His readings and travels with such notables as James Dickey, Allen Ginsberg, Ai, Charles Bukowski, and F. D. Reeve are legendary. The poems are rich in wit, irreverence and a furious honesty. Everything is autobiographical. From intimate relationships, political quagmires, baseball and eroticism, Douskey wields an acerbic wit and a delicate command of tone to dive into the contradictions that make us human. From the haunted urban alleys of a turbulent childhood to his rhapsodic journeys through the nocturnal deserts of the Southwest, Douskey revels both in the absurdity of modern civilization and the heart-stopping beauty of the natural world. —Robert Reinhardt   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Douglas Treem's Everything So Seriously the poems and their denizens seek to tear the world a new buttonhole. They are souls in torment. Bodies filled with pain. Hearts being spoken from. A violent psychopath in search of his own death. An actor attempting the opposite of suicide. A sex worker numb to all human connection. An icon. A myth. Those with needs mutated past the possibility of ever being met. United beyond the common threads of flesh and blood by the uniquely human demand to tell their stories and the shared position of having no one on earth to talk to. Except you.

Stenhouse’s ironically titled collection plays against the backdrop of this mythic riddle. Privilege is tied to punishment: two sides of the same seemingly inescapable coin. In these poems, even nature is seen through a lens of power, money, sex and addiction. These themes and others unfold in images both startling and effortless. We see a poet tackling the big questions, unsatisfied with easy answers, longing for clear borders, for definition, for love and redemption—for impunity. Stenhouse writes with clarity, humor, bravery—her fresh wisdom underscores the visceral details that allow us to see the world as if we have just landed on it.

In this, his second full-length book of poems, Fanelli artfully recounts coming-of-age narratives that recall the poet’s encounter with schoolyard bullies while also addressing post-9/11 America, global terrorism, Ferguson, Black Lives Matter, and widening economic inequality. The poems in this book beg for a protest movement or some leader to rise up and address the unraveling American dream and unfettered capitalism. Fanelli also references 1970s punk rock pioneers like The Clash and applies the band's four-chord tracks to current injustices. Other cultural references include Bruce Springsteen, James Dean, The X-Files, and horror movies, often to draw a connection between the poet and his industrial northeastern Pennsylvania hometown or the connection between the poet and his father. Often, the references serve as a way to show that despite differences, there are always some commonalities and shared interests between father and son. At the heart of the book is a questioning of what remains once loved ones depart or relationships dissolve, in particular ways in which past relationships impact the present.

Expertly navigating the back roads, she guides us through a vivid and idiosyncratic landscape, pointing out where all the best secrets are kept. O'Keefe has a wonderful eye for detail, a vision both quirky and deeply human.” — Nina Corwin, Fifth Wednesday Journal  “Making Good Use of August announces Sherry O'Keefe as a strong new voice in the poetry of place. Each poem in this collection while unique, builds a unified narrative image vast and detailed as a mural or tapestry. Our reading experience is as varied as the dramatis personae who inhabit these poems. We vicariously see through O'Keefe and her people the small details remembered from a rural childhood, the bitterness of seduction and regret, and the difficulties and pleasures of navigating this modern life.

[His] metaphorical desert is the arid world of tv and popular culture, of instant physical gratification. His prison is the body which requires constant stimulation. His poetry represents a strong American philosophical response to those realities. The transcendence of the body through the imagination... If this isn't the poetry of prophecy, I don't know what it is. America, the 20th century, we need more of it."" In Selected Poems, 1969-1981, Richard Shelton has brought together the best of his previously published work as well as a selection of new poems. It is the work of a poet who rises above the narrowness of current fashions and schools, the book of a major American poet.

Es sind sind Zeugen eines unangepassten Lebens, sie wettern gegen Chefs, rufen auf zu Streik und Sabotage und sprechen von der Mühsal, mit wenig Geld durch das Leben zu kommen. Er erzählt Autobiographisches nach, lakonisch, kurz, ohne Wertung: seine Kindheit in Winterthur, seine Arbeit für die Gewerkschaft, seine Erfahrungen als Maler, auf dem Bau. Wenn Joe Hill wieder auftaucht, wenn die schwarze Katze der Anarchie durch die Nacht zieht, wenn dem arroganten Vorarbeiter mit Bauschaum der Auspuff verstopft wird, dann sind das die kleinen Momente, die vielleicht nicht den Ausweg aus dem monotonen Arbeitsleben, aber zumindest ein grimmiges Lächeln erlauben. Es sind Gedichte, die den Augenblick festhalten, die Flüchtigkeit des Moments, ohne dass sie sich reimen würden. Es sind Gedichte aus der mündlichen Sprache geschöpft: Erzähltes, Erfahrenes, bei denen ein Unterton von Bitterkeit mitschwingt, eine harte, trockene Kürze, die sich dem Publikum weder aufdrängt, noch anbiedern möchte. Es ist so, wie es ist, dieses Leben.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A history of the cetacean American diaspora,Jenna Le,poetry,First published in 2018,/works/OL19760995W,/authors/OL6973713A/Jenna_Le,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 82,"""Le's furious and steeled voice leaves nothing unturned, propelling these poems through explorations on displacement, womanhood, the body and its endured violences, by confronting a history as tenuous and elusive as the ghosts it conjures. She has created her own version of the Ark, one where the whale, forgotten in the original, is now carried as 'a child of immigrants, like me.' In these tender, earnest yet fierce poems, Le does not reinvent myth, but expands it to include our most damned outsiders. And how lucky we are that, like the great Robert Hayden, she has created a vision where 'Nothing human is foreign...'

Love and its Critics,Michael Bryson,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL23498774W,/authors/OL3581717A/Michael_Bryson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 576,"""This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists.    The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted.      It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.""

Postsymbolistisches Schreiben. Studien zur Poetik des Akmeismus und Osip Mandel'štams,Annette Werberger,poetry,First published in 2005,/works/OL23499913W,/authors/OL5710967A/Annette_Werberger,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 330,"Since Žirmunskij the acmeists have been considered ""overcomers of symbolism"", which has led to many misunderstandings about the acmeist poetics. While the symbolists discovered the ambiguity of the word as the basis of metaphor, the acmeists are more aware of the connection between identity and plurality of the word. They understand the idea of ​​a complete independence of the poetic language from everyday language as an illusion and danger and sustainably pragmatic symbolist understanding of the language. Acmeistic writing tries to referentle to different levels and to create a kind of ""new realism of writing"". In their texts, the acmeists try to regain authenticity and reality through a greater temporal-spatial and cultural contextualization, the inclusion of reality substrates, greater involvement of everyday language, dialogical expressions, taking up a historical design language or a narrative Parlandogestik. - The work also offers a brief view of the reception of acmeism by Brodskij, Celan and Grünbein.  Seit Žirmunskij gelten die Akmeisten als ""Überwinder des Symbolismus"", was zu vielen Missverständnissen über die akmeistische Poetik geführt hat. Während die Symbolisten die Vieldeutigkeit des Wortes als Grundlage der Metaphorik für sich entdeckten, sind sich die Akmeisten stärker des Zusammenhangs von Identität und Pluralität des Wortes bewusst. Sie begreifen die Idee einer völligen Unabhängigkeit der dichterischen Sprache von der Alltagssprache als Illusion und Gefahr und pragmatisieren das symbolistische Sprachverständnis nachhaltig. Akmeistisches Schreiben versucht sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen referentiell zu verankern und eine Art ""neuen Realismus des Schreibens"" zu erschaffen. Die Akmeisten versuchen dabei in ihren Texten, über eine größere zeitlich-räumliche und kulturelle Kontextualisierung, die Aufnahme von Realitätssubstraten, eine stärkere Einbindung der Alltagssprache, dialogische Wendungen, das Aufgreifen einer historischen Formensprache oder eine narrative Parlandogestik wieder Authentizität und Wirklichkeit zu gewinnen. - Die Arbeit bietet zugleich einen kurzen Ausblick auf die Rezeption des Akmeismus durch Brodskij, Celan und Grünbein.

Poststalinizm - Postavangardizm,Gesine Dornblüth,poetry,First published in 1999,/works/OL23500539W,/authors/OL8908843A/Gesine_Dornblüth,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 194,"In examining the subject and his relation to the objects, it can be seen that Andrei Voznesensky's official poetry of the late 1950s and early 1960s contains postmodern elements; indeed, because it is unconsciously postmodern, it far exceeds the original conception of French philosophy from ""postmodernism"" corresponds to the so-called Russian Neoavantgarde. The aim of this work, to comprehensively and closely examine the relationship between subject and object in Voznesensky, and the comparative approach require that one limit oneself to exemplary analyzes. For this purpose, six poems were selected that are meaningful in relation to the subject.  Bei der Untersuchung des Subjekts und seinem Verhältnis zu den Objekten zeigt sich, daß bereits Andrej Voznesenskijs offizielle Lyrik der späten 50er und frühen 60er Jahre postmoderne Elemente enthält, ja daß sie, da sie unbewußt postmodern ist, sogar weit mehr der ursprünglichen Auffassung der französischen Philosophie von ""Postmoderne"" entspricht als die sogenannte russische Neoavantgarde. Die Zielsetzung dieser Arbeit, umfassend und textnah das Verhältnis zwischen Subjekt und Objekt bei Voznesenskij zu untersuchen, und die komparatistische Vorgehensweise erfordern es, sich auf exemplarische Analysen zu beschränken. Dazu wurden sechs Gedichte ausgewählt, die in bezug auf das Subjekt aussagekräftig sind.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Using natural language charged with concision and precise syntax, Greenstreet has created a memorable and lasting first collection.  “A life lived at the peripheries is partially cut open into tiny chapters that are then tugged off-camera between erasure and restoration, as an unexplained house awaits its occupant on the opposite coast. This book collects that distance through which the driver-writer hears her own randomness speak, en route, with explicit acuity and fragmented instruction, as if narrated via a brain-fever collage of loving/warning mentors—M. Curie, Modersohn-Becker, and L. Niedecker, for a start. Entering and underscoring these fugal compressions is the ‘lower limit’ of an ongoing mystery story vernacularized through her car’s CD speakers. The result is a poem intrigue of the highest order. Greenstreet has made a brilliant beginning with this first book.” —Kathleen Fraser  “A beautiful dwelling of ideas. case sensitive suggests that there need be no divide between the associative connections of poetry and the extended thinking of the essay. This is a book full of luminous footnotes, details, and attentive readings. It strings together a series of moments to create something resonate, large, and inclusive.” —Juliana Spahr  from Ahsahta Press   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But hers is a new voice that is at once playful and passionate, energetic and earnest, bold but never banal, engaging and endearing but never disingenuous. We shall hear from her again.""--Peter Hargitai, Author of Mother Tongue  ""Vivian Little has composed innocence's requiem. Through her poetry one can feel the splatter of her tears and the patter of her heart. Blood is shed and penned on paper. A tremolo cry echoes resiliently, innocence refuses to die.""--Victor del Cid  Vivian Little dances among the differences that love creates in contemporary America. Her explicit admissions and truthful tone causes complex characters to fall forth from simple sentences. These mystifyingly musical verses encourage deeper inspection of passionate pages, immersed in sadness, strength and sensuality.  What might be seen as a juvenile affair: kisses, tears, betrayal, loss of virtue, climbs the ladder to maturity with scandalous couplets and piercing intelligence.

Her vibrant imagery combines with streetwise wit, and is merciless in its unwavering penetration of social hypocrisy. Stahl combines a rich sense of history with the legacy of surrealism. Her work has attracted the attention of poets like Paul Blackburn and Allen Ginsberg, as well as J.M. Coetzee who praised her ""poised, wry humor."" Riding with Destiny combines both Whitman's affirmation of a larger self, one that is all-embracing with poetry that takes us to the edge, not merely to taste danger, but to dance the dance of life.

So F.D. Reeve writes in a poem entitled ""Violets in a Pewter Vase."" For nearly fifty years, he has found in nature both a refuge from human imperfection and an exquisite rejoinder to it. Whether that imperfection be the war in Afghanistan, worsening economic inequality, or even the ridiculous pretense of a thoroughly professionalized poetry, Reeve makes of aesthetic perception a kind of subjunctive faith. For a moment one man's skill offers the possibility of redemption, and the alternatives behind experience bloom like those fragile violets in a pewter vase. With its elegant short lyrics and long dramatic poem, which reworks the Daedalus-Icarus myth by situating it on a Caribbean island and which serves as the text for a jazz opera, The Puzzle Master breaks new ground in the music of holistic response. In this his tenth collection, the winner of the Golden Rose Award for lifetime achievement in poetry offers a poetry adequate to our time.

It's a book filled with cripples, the one boy in a working class house who kept a book under his bed, schoolyard superstars, the last white man left standing in Bed Stuy, basement songs of love and desperation, the rhythm of the crowded F train, developmentally disabled men, and one boy with autism. He's the guy who sat in the back of workshop who knew that Springsteen, Thurman Munson and Brian Wilson will always mean more to him than Shakespeare, Ginsburg and Ashbery, but who still wants to write a poem that's better than the ones you were forced to read in school, a poem that will hit you like a punch to the gut, but only if a punch could be somehow tender too.  It's a book about the quiet ones, the ones you don't notice, the ones who never raise their hands to volunteer, shoot up a classroom or do a victory lap after making the game winning play. They don't blame their parents for anything, and they never learned how to walk across a crowded room to talk to a pretty woman or how to ever ask anyone for help. It's how they go through the days trying to find places and people, no sorry, just one person, that can help them feel at home with themselves. It's all about loss, love, loneliness, lust, the power of memory and what's wished for and missed. The Last Lie is about your life. Exactly. Only different. Worse. Better.

His narratives are as much at home on asphalt as they are in bean fields. The natural world is common to the many facets of this collection. Like birds, his poems fly with striking images—as accessible as crank-pot crows, assassin herons, or starlings startled by cannon shot. There's a good deal of wind and spit, flower and piss in a poetry where tornadoes and baseball are not incongruous to a single summer evening. His characters are tough and smart. They revel in a lingering city decadence and messy small town beauty.emphasized text   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is a journey that begins in New York City where he lives and where he distills its concrete landscape with an insightful, unexpected use of language and imagery. His Boswellian eye for detail and accuracy of insight continues as he travels to New England, and onto the beaches of California, Mexico, the Caribbean and then to Greece. Each poem in the collection is a discovery transforming the familiar into an individual, unique experience. These poems are personal confrontations with the world and the ultimate inner discovery of what it means to be human.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Kate Greenstreet would like you to read this book as if you had found it left behind on the empty bus seat next to you—a document not directly addressing the question “Why do we make art,” but one that notices that one does make art, despite conditions, and that one would regardless.  “This is all strangely familiar. To use one of its own images, reading this book is like opening a folding table after closing a door. There are two kinds of hinge, we might say. You feel the grammar in your hands and your shoulders. You begin to see how the table gets you from the eggs to the window. It just stands there. Perhaps this is, as Greenstreet suggests, like a dream you sometimes have. But (and this is the thing) it is also like going for a walk or building some intricate part of a boat. It is not the place of the poet to decide.  “A poem is not a place where a decision is made and this is certainly no time to explain yourself. ‘This is what went on here,’ Wittgenstein taught us, ‘Laugh if you can.’ Greenstreet understands this, and her lines do sometimes make you laugh. But not always. She says, ‘Do a dangerous thing and you’re in danger. That’s how it works.’ She doesn’t tell you to live dangerously; she just tells you how it works. Or let me put it another way: she understands why you want to go to the sea but she does not know whether you will go.  “The whole issue in these pages is one of arrangement. It is about the idea that things have places, ‘pages and pages of places,’ in fact. Greenstreet puts words in these places sometimes. Sometimes not. Is a blank page also an arrangement of words? In what way is a blank page with no marks on it like a human body? Or is it like water? Suppose we had to choose: like a body or like water? Don’t just sit there, this book seems to say, let’s have a look at where things go.  “A poem is made by composition, by putting things together, and when you read this book your hands tingle. The Last 4 Things brings craftsmanship to reverie; it turns dreaming into meaningful work. It is a serious approach to the grammar of our emotions and you do well to read it with your hands.” —Thomas Basbøll  from Ahsahta Press   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The new poetics of climate change,Matthew Griffiths,poetry,First published in 2017,/works/OL19754141W,/authors/OL4597405A/Matthew_Griffiths,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 211,"Climate change is the greatest crisis of our time--and yet too often writing on the subject is separated off as ""environmental"" writing, divorced from culture, society and politics. The New Poetics of Climate Change argues that the reality of global warming presents us with a fundamental challenge to the way we read and write poetry in the modern age. In this important new book, Matthew Griffiths demonstrates the ways in which modernism's radical reinvigorations of literary form over the last century represents an engagement with key intellectual questions that we still need to address if we are to comprehend the scale and complexity of climate change. Through an extended examination of modernist poetry, including the work of T.S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Basil Bunting and David Jones, and their influence on present-day poets such as Michael Symmons Roberts and Jorie Graham, Griffiths explores how modernist modes help us describe and engage with the terrifying dynamics of a warming world and offer a poetics of our climate.

Reflecting their variety of visions and styles, The Oxford Anthology of African-American Poetry aims to offer nothing less than a definitive literary portrait of a people."" ""Here are poems by writers as different as Paul Laurence Dunbar and W. E. B. Du Bois; Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes; Gwendolyn Brooks and Amiri Barakia; Rita Dove and Harryette Mullen; Yusef Komunyakaa and Nathaniel Mackey. Acclaimed as a biographer and editor, Arnold Rampersad groups these poems as meditations on key issues in black culture, including the idea of Africa; the South; slavery; protest, and resistance; the black man, woman, and child; sexuality and love; music and religion; spirituality; death, and transcendence."" ""With their often starkly contrasting visions and styles, these poets illuminate some of the more controversial and intimate aspects of the black American experience. Poetry here is not only or mainly a vehicle of protest but also an exploration of the more complex and tender subtleties of black culture. One section offers tributes to celebrated leaders such as Sojourner Truth and Malcolm X, but many more reflect the heroism compelled by everyday black life. The variety of poetic forms and language captures the brilliant essence of English as mastered by black Americans dedicated to the art of poetry.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

She turns to the familiarity and strangeness of the female body, its surfaces and inner workings, often, although her subjects range from Thomas Jefferson to an Adam and Eve plagued with obsessive-compulsive disorder to the streets of New York’s diamond district. The poems, by turns funny and philosophical, point to how we suffer from desire: the danger, she writes, is that we might love the world “like heaven and be lost.” But they come back to delight in a flawed world especially the palpable beauty of words, and even the erotic shapes of the letterforms that make them up.

In the twelfth century, Martinian studies flourished again and Guibert of Gembloux (d. 1213) was an outstanding collector of ancient and modern material about his favourite patron, which he used as a basis for various works of his own. In the centre of this biographical and didactical project Guibert placed two rhythmical poems, which he dedicated to the life of Martin (Libellus panegericus) and an impressive series of his venerators (Libellus de specialibus piissimi patroni veneratoribus).

Confluence,Samantha DeFlitch,poetry,First published in 2021,/works/OL32108141W,/authors/OL11648688A/Samantha_DeFlitch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Broadstone|Language English|Pages 56,"""The confluence in the title of this debut collection from Samantha DeFlitch describes the meeting of three rivers, the Monongahela and Allegheny which come together at Pittsburgh to form the Ohio. The three sections of her book are named for these rivers, and there are many poems of place here, the author's home turf, its backroads and bridges, state lines, amusement parks, a town called Zelienople, even Pittsburgh itself, depicted most provocatively as a city of ""accidental lesbians."" But as a gas station attendant says when she answers where she is from, ""Nobody lives in Pittsburgh,"" an observation that shifts the register from the physical to the psyche, and to a different sort of confluence, the way in which we are all products of everything that has come before and come together to form our lives. DeFlitch depicts this in the construction of her poems. There are many recurring images and motifs, of oranges and blackbirds, dogs, pierogis, gas stations, concern over the aging of parents, of aging herself, of a ""boy named John"" who ""put a bullet in his head"" because he didn't want to grow old --and of folding chairs that turn up everywhere, such a brilliantly efficient exemplar of the temporary. She repeats words, lines, even nearly entire poems, and in this manner her poems resemble merging waters, full of ripples, eddies, swirls, back currents of detritus, endlessly forming and reforming over time and space""--Amazon.

Born in France, raised in Florida, Kercheval now divides her time between the U.S. and Uruguay. The poems hurtle across literary and linguistic borders toward a lyricism that slows down experience to create a new form of elegiac memoir. Against the backdrops of Paris, Montevideo, and Florida, the poems explore citizenship and homelessness, motherhood and self, family and freedom, turning over and over again the very meaning of the word home, as the poems, like the poet, make the fraught journey back and forth between America and France. As Kercheval wonders in her poem ""The Red Balloon,"" ""is leaving / ever painless? Is returning?""""-- Page [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

THE WELL STRING is not only a poetry collection, but a novel in poems - focusing on one fictional family over a span of more than 100 years. Novelist Silas House, in the book's foreword, calls THE WELL STRING ""a journey of wonders,"" ""a powerful book,"" and ""a gift."" House adds, ""Many of the characters in THE WELL STRING are so haunting that we might never forget them,"" noting that Smith also ""captures the natural world, which she knows has 'always the song of the Redbird, like a silver drop.'"" Novelist Lee Smith describes THE WELL STRING as ""highly charged with intensity and originality, yet oddly familiar somehow, as if it has actually happened to us."" Poet and novelist Ron Rash calls the book ""vividly rendered ... excellent"" and ""utterly convincing,"" concluding that ""THE WELL STRING is a significant contribution to Appalachian Literature.""--MotesBooks.com.

These poems focus on art and music, truth and falsehood, love and betrayal, which are forces that constantly engage the human spirit. The poems explore the homonyms insight, incite, and in sight. Insight is a heavy burden of discerning the true nature and complexity of situations and their effects. Language and truth must be one with each other or we truly have no way to live together in freedom. Our current prevailing culture pushes upon us lies and deceit. It attacks the very basis of a person's worth by trying to make people believe they have no will, no discipline, and no hope unless it comes from politicians. Writers have a duty to use their talent to expose deceit and to present truth based on fact through their insight. The writing of poetry has been a revolutionary act of truth telling for thousands of years.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He writes in a variety of forms--sonnets, sestinas, rondeaux, free verse, and syllabics--with humor, music, clarity, and irony about his lifelong struggle with himself and an unforgiving God.

Il lutto attraversa le pagine in modo asincrono […] perché pezzo per pezzo lo ritroviamo dentro di noi, mentre pezzo per pezzo, diceva Freud, ci rendiamo conto che non è più con noi […]. Viaggio nostalgico della solitudine, il “no proprio no”, l’ “anziché” della desolazione, la poesia di Luigi Maria Sicca alla fine si rivela a se stessa.    Dalla Introduzione di Sarantis Thanopulos  ma il tempo qui narrato e il cadenzare ritmico della narrazione lasciano scivolare queste poesie una dopo l’altra, una dentro l’altra in una sorta di metro musicale in cui il significante non rimanda necessariamente a un significato, se non come può accadere appunto nella musica strumentale, nella musica senza parole, come Hanslik ci ha definitivamente insegnato, in “Il bello musicale”. Questo voglio qui sottolineare ascoltando i versi scritti da Luigi Maria Sicca.    Dalla Prefazione di Francesco D’Errico  Ad tempo taci anche per capire quando il silenzio deve coprire la parola, darci la forza di consumare il dolore, negarci quello che di dolce la malinconia ci regala, ritmicamente avanzare per tentare, invano, di afferrare brandelli di verità. In queste pause silenziose, a volte nervose, a volte affrante, a volte ironiche, Sicca ci fa immaginare dei mondi, orizzonti d’attesa che spesso vengono spezzati da tempeste o da semplici gesti quotidiani. A volte sembra quasi di ascoltare il rimbombo delle eterne parole di Agamennone sulla vergogna […], perché i superstiti che lasciamo sono più numerosi dei caduti.

Earthbound,Dee LeRoy,poetry,First published in 2014,/works/OL27715785W?edition=ia%3Aearthboundpoems0000lero,/authors/OL10347673A/Dee_LeRoy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37812764M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Mudstone Press|Language English|Pages 127,"With her first collection, LeRoy delivers luminous, art-inspired poems that expertly balance the concepts of nature and the human struggle. LeRoy, a retired science writer, could easily be an art historian, given her facility with the Impressionists and Dutch masters. Many of these free-verse poems have the concentrated color and frozen action of a still-life. 'The Yellow Fields of Gennevilliers' compares two Gustave Caillebotte paintings, while 'Wheat Field with Crows' juxtaposes past and present as Vincent van Gogh's grief foreshadows an ill friend's demise. 'The Lady and the Unicorn', a close reading of a Parisian tapestry, recalls author Tracy Chevalier's literary approach to history. Permeated with color and light, many poems are like mood studies: 'September' features ""sapphire sky"" and ""afternoon's blue""; 'The Old House' exhibits shades of gray, a recurrent hue. LeRoy chooses alliteration and assonance over rhyme. Repeated consonant sounds create soothing rhythms, as in ""unsuspecting sea"" and ""fiddleheads unfurl: / fanfare"". The poems are carefully organized to bleed into each other thematically. For instance, in 'Evidence for Strings', physics - specifically string theory - cedes to talk of music and stringed instruments; the next poem, 'Violin', then follows seamlessly. Likewise, the striking intersection of beauty and violence in 'Planting Tulips' - ""a battlefield so strewn / with brightly turbaned heads / it was compared to a bed of tulips"" - leads to the war-themed 'Verdun'. The author's knowledge of plants comes through in her delicate description of chicory ""this asterisk of color"", and in 'Saguaro', a poem inventively written from a cactus' perspective. One stanza of 'Ginkgo' resembles a haiku, making it germane to its Asian setting. LeRoy masters the confluence of art and science, joining writers such as Ruth Padel, Andrea Barrett and A.S. Byatt. Almost equally valuable, however, are her subtle relationship poems, such as 'Firewater', in which a collision of life-giving but destructive forces symbolizes the challenges of marriage. Five final poems about medical crises and death ease into a superb finale: ""sorrowed by so much lost / hungry for what remains."" A stunning poetic debut.

Twentieth-Century Russian Poetry,,poetry,,/works/OL20931313W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 512,"""The canon of Russian poetry has been reshaped since the fall of the Soviet Union. A multi-authored study of changing cultural memory and identity, this revisionary work charts Russia?s shifting relationship to its own literature in the face of social upheaval. Literary canon and national identity are inextricably tied together, the composition of a canon being the attempt to single out those literary works that best express a nation?s culture. This process is, of course, fluid and subject to significant shifts, particularly at times of epochal change. This volume explores changes in the canon of twentieth-century Russian poetry from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union to the end of Putin?s second term as Russian President in 2008. In the wake of major institutional changes, such as the abolition of state censorship and the introduction of a market economy, the way was open for wholesale reinterpretation of twentieth-century poets such as Iosif Brodskii, Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandel?shtam, their works and their lives. In the last twenty years many critics have discussed the possibility of various coexisting canons rooted in official and non-official literature and suggested replacing the term """"Soviet literature"""" with a new definition ? """"Russian literature of the Soviet period"""".    Contributions to this volume explore the multiple factors involved in reshaping the canon, understood as a body of literary texts given exemplary or representative status as """"classics"""". Among factors which may influence the composition of the canon are educational institutions, competing views of scholars and critics, including figures outside Russia, and the self-canonising activity of poets themselves. Canon revision further reflects contemporary concerns with the destabilising effects of emigration and the internet, and the desire to reconnect with pre-revolutionary cultural traditions through a narrative of the past which foregrounds continuity. Despite persistent nostalgic yearnings in some quarters for a single canon, the current situation is defiantly diverse, balancing both the Soviet literary tradition and the parallel contemporaneous literary worlds of the emigration and the underground.    Required reading for students, teachers and lovers of Russian literature, Twentieth-Century Russian Poetry brings our understanding of post-Soviet Russia up to date.""

Love and its Critics,Arpi Movsesian,poetry,,/works/OL20931321W,/authors/OL8012027A/Arpi_Movsesian,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 576,"""This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton?s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin?amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur?s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself ? in short, the very things it resists.    The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted.      It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.""

Great Upheaval & Other Legends A Collection Of Longpoems,Bill Hotchkiss,poetry,First published in 1990,/works/OL5905797W,/authors/OL1457755A/Bill_Hotchkiss,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11405374M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1990|Publisher  Castle Peak Editions|Pages 150,"From the Afterword:  In Hotchkiss's brief ""Author's Notes,"" the poet indicates that his purpose ""is neither to preach the grim gospel of realistic ecology nor to indict humanity yet one more time…"" (147). Nevertheless, a message is conveyed in the best way possible, through the spirit in the works themselves, … Hotchkiss's daemon. Percy Shelley's Preface to ""Prometheus Unbound"" contains the same sort of disclaimer but with an amplification I suspect applies to Hotchkiss's work as well:        Didactic poetry is my abhorrence; nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse. My purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarize the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence; aware that until the mind can love, and admire, and trust, and hope, and endure, reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust, although they would bear the harvest of his happiness. In unrestrained diversity, Hotchkiss's poems nurture this excellent purpose. As root, trunk, and waving tree top are one, so are the diverse forms of the actions of visionary existence in these poems. They have a common shape, and their roots are intertwined in a universal psyche. Looking to a diversity of what has been, Hotchkiss, like the ""lone figure"" at the conclusion of ""Great Upheaval,"" walks through the pages of this book at the ocean's edge"" of our existence, seeming to whistle ""a tuneless composition that he is apparently inventing as he strolls"" (24). Like the seed sown by poetic predecessors,        He that sows seed, words       He sows: and the words       Are clean and sweet       In the wind, in sunlight       And ocean and earth…. (21-22) Bill Hotchkiss is a child of Nature and of books, and the blossoms of their seed reside everywhere in the garden of his poetry. Now again they seed the wind, which to the casual reader at first may seem a tuneless composition. But with time and being listened to, his words in the wind will be heard as the songs of important vision they are, songs that ""Are clean and sweet …"" of yesterdays, today, and todays to come—but as they are and as they ought to be.
