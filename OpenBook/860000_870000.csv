Music beyond Airports,Monty Adkins,music,First published in 2019,/works/OL23499196W,/authors/OL8908451A/Monty_Adkins,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  University of Huddersfield Press|Pages 254,"This collection of essays has been assembled and developed from papers given at the Ambient@40 International Conference held in February 2018 at the University of Huddersfield. The original premise of the conference was not merely to celebrate Eno’s work and the landmark release of Music for Airports in 1978, but to consider the development of the genre, how it has permeated our wider musical culture, and what the role of such music is today given the societal changes that have occurred since the release of that album.  In the context of the conference, ambient was considered from the perspectives of aesthetic, influence, appropriation, process, strategy and activity. A detailed consideration of each of these topics could fill many volumes. With that in mind, this book does not seek to provide an in-depth analysis of each of these topics or a comprehensive history of the last 40 years of ambient music. Rather it provides a series of provocations, observations and reflections that each open up seams for further discussion. As such, this book should be read as a starting point for future research, one that seeks to critically interrogate the very meaning of ‘ambient’, how it creates its effect, and how the genre can remain vital and relevant in twenty-first century music-making.

The essays in this volume combine contributions on historical and present-day questions about the relationship between politics and musical creativity. The first part concentrates on musical identity and political reality, discussing ideological values in musical discourses.The second part deals with (musical) constructions, drawing on diverse national connections within our own and foreign identity.

Eduard Hanslick - Sämtliche Schriften. Historisch-kritische Ausgabe : Band I/6,Eduard Hanslik,music,First published in 2008,/works/OL23501148W,/authors/OL8012543A/Eduard_Hanslik,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Böhlau|Pages 536,"The present sixth volume of the new historic-critical complete edition of Eduard Hanslick´s works contains texts of the years 1862 to 1863, which are for the most part contributions from the Vienna ""Presse"". Some articles were published shortly after in national music journals such as the ""Niederrheinische Musik-Zeitung"" or the Berlin music journal ""Echo"". Hanslick revised som of them later for his well-known anthologies (""Die moderne Oper"", aus dem Konzertsaal. Geschichte des Konzertwesens in Wien, II2). As before these texts were provided with lists of variant readings, which are printed subsequent to the respective article. The principles of publication were not changed. Minor variations are: different spelling, change from spaced writing to normal distance of characters or vice versa, smaller modification of the wording, updating or additions. Major changes mainly consist in leaving out large parts of the text or rearranging text passages from different sources to particular subjects. The fundamental change in Hanslick´s occupation as a critic as can be seen exactly from the 1860s, that is his stronger attention to reviewing the performance cannot be substantiated by his own editions so well because he often left out parts related to the concert. From that point of view this edition provides not only a better survey of the Vienna concert life in these years than Hanslick´s own edition but it also notes down in a much more precise way his changed approach to writing. Most of the texts, however, are completely unknown today.  The main essay in the comment part deals with the music-aesthetic consequences of the phenomenon of boredom, the typical syndrome of the 19th century, which Hanslick´s reviews shed some light on. It becomes clear that there are more criteria in Hanslick that are important for an assessment of a work than those laid down in ""Vom Musikalisch-Schönen"".  An important position in Hanslick´s life as a music critik take his trips to music festivals or world expositions. His travel diaries are still very informative and shown an open-minded cosmopolitan. Hanslick´s report on the bustle of the 1862 word exposition in London from an initially neutral attitude of an observer seems in a certain way to turn into a surrealistic inferno of the arising modern age and confirms unconsciously what Walter Benjamin realized first and formulated in his ""Passagenwerk"". This matter is dealt with a particular length in the notes, which as before briefly characterize, annotate or analyse for its aesthetic relevance every single text. Added to the annotations is an excerpt from a letter by August Wilhelm Ambros, which illustrates some aspects from Hanslick´s aesthetic of boredom from a different point of view.  Der vorliegende sechste Band der neuen historisch-kritischen Gesamtausgabe der Schriften von Eduard Hanslick enthält Texte der Jahre 1862 bis 1863. Es sind überwiegend Beiträge aus der Wiener ""Presse"". Manche Artikel erschienen kurz darauf in überregionalen Musikzeitschriften wie der ""Niederrheinischen Musik-Zeitung"" oder der Berliner-Musikzeitung ""Echo"". Einen Teil überarbeitete Hanslick später für seine bekannten Sammelbände (""Die moderne Oper"", ""Aus dem Concertsaal. Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien, II""). Für diese Texte wurden wie bisher Lesartenverzeichnisse erstellt, die im Anschluss an die jeweiligen Zeitungsartikel abgedruckt sind. Die Editionsprinzipien blieben gleich. Geringfügige Varianten sind: andere Schreibweise, Wechsel von Sperrdruck zu normalem Zeichenabstand oder umgekehrt, kleinere Formulierungsänderungen, Aktualisierungen oder Hinzufügungen. Gravierende Änderungen bestehen hauptsächlich im Wegfall großer Textpartien oder der Neumontage von Textpassagen aus verschiedenen Quellen zu bestimmten Themen. Die grundsätzliche Änderung in Hanslicks Kritikertätigkeit, wie sie gerade ab den 1860-er Jahren festzustellen ist, nämlich seine stärkere Zuwendung zur Leistungskritik, kann man seinen eigenen Editionen nicht so gut belegen, weil er oft aufführungsbezogene Teile weggelassen hat. Insofern gibt diese Ausgabe nicht nur einen besseren Überblick über das Wiener Konzertleben dieser Jahre als Hanslicks eigene Edition, sondern verzeichnet viel genauer seine geänderte Schreibhaltung. Die meisten Texte jedoch sind heute gänzlich unbekannt.  Der Hauptessay im Kommentarteil beschäftigt sich mit den musikästhetischen Konsequenzen aus dem Phänomen der Langeweile, dem typischen Krankheitsbild des 19. Jahrhunderts, zu dem Hanslicks Kritiken manche Erhellung bringen. Es wird deutlich, dass es bei Hanslick noch andere wichtige Kriterien für eine Werkbewertung gilbt als die in ""Vom Musikalisch-Schönen"" festgelegten.  Eine wichtige Stellung in Hanslicks Leben als Musikkritiker nehmen seine Reisen zu Musikfesten oder zu Weltausstellungen ein. Seine Reiseberichte sind immer noch sehr informativ und zeigen einen weltoffenen Kosmopoliten. Hanslicks Referat über den Betrieb auf der Londoner Weltausstellung 1862 aus einer zunächst neutralen Beobachterhaltung gerät zu einem surrealistisch anmutenden Inferno der aufkommenden Moderne und bestätigt unbewußt Erkenntnisse, die Walter Benjamin zuerst in seinem ""Passagenwerk"" formulierte. Dies wird in den Erläuterungen, die wie bisher knapp die einzelnen Texte charakterisieren, kommentieren oder auf ästhetische Relevanz in befragen, besonders ausführlich behandelt. Dem Kommentarteil ist ein Auszug aus einem Brief von August Wilhelm Ambros beigefügt, der einige Sachverhalte aus Hanslicks Ästhetik der Langeweile aus einer anderen Perspektive beleuchtet.  Der Band schließt mit einem wissenschaftlichen Apparat (Verzeichnis der emedierten Druckfehler, Abkürzungsverzeichnis, Literaturverzeichnis und Personenindex).

Elektrische Klangmaschinen,Peter Donhauser,music,First published in 2007,/works/OL23501073W,/authors/OL5765905A/Peter_Donhauser,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Böhlau|Pages 348,"The publication deals with the time of pioneers in building ""electrical musical instruments"" in German speaking countries. It is based on a research project funded by the Austrian National Bank's ""Jubilaeumsfonds"" (project number 9382), where the popularisation of these instruments was in focus. Starting with the first attempts the development in the respective region is examined for the time between 1920 and 1945 using carefully investigated documents. After a short description of the roots going back to the 19th century the documentation continues with a critical evaluation of the constructions and their presentation in the 1920ties (especially Joerg Mager and Lev Termen and the reaction of experts and the public). Electro-optic and electromagnetic sound generation was invented in that time as well but appeared later on. There are examples for both principles in Austria and Germany reaching back to the 1920ties. A representative survey of press reports show the different estimations of the usability of electrical musical instruments by technicians, musicians and the public. The following decade is treated in several parts due to the political development in Germany. The first two years are mainly marked by the invention of the Trautonium, the Neo-Bechstein-piano, the Elektrochord and the Hellertion. This was the time when Berlin turned out as a centre for ""electrical music"", especially by activities of the ""Rundfunkversuchsstelle"" (radio research institute) at the University of Music and the Heinrich-Hertz-Institute. The first major public presentations at the Berlin Radio Shows took place in this time as well. After the year 1933 not only the political situation changed but the cultural preconditions for the usage of electrical instruments as well. The political convergence with the NS regime and the goodwill of the ""ministry of public enlightenment and propaganda"" played an important role. It turned out by the following development that the Trautonium, the electric organs by Vierling and the Hellertion by Bruno Helberger were used for official occasions. Vierling's ""Grosstonorgel"" was used during the Olympic games, on the other hand the development of Edwin Welte's light-tone organ was stopped for he was married with a Jewish woman. The work of Oskar Sala plays an important role in the area of conflict between technology, politics and music. As no detailed documentation of the work of Joerg Mager (who claimed to be the leading person in electro-music research) is available till now, this will be discussed in a separate chapter. A short description of the consequences after 1945 is followed by a detailed appendix: data of concerts, sound recordings, technical documentations and more than 600 patents. The book is based on extensive and original material, as it turned out by studying of secondary literature that many details are based on not provable sources. The facts are carefully documented using footnotes, the book is meant as a fundamental collection of sources for further scientific research.  Die Publikation handelt von der Pionierzeit der ""elektrischen Instrumente"" im deutschsprachigen Raum. Sie beruht im Wesentlichen auf einem Forschungsauftrag des Jubiläumsfonds der Österreichischen Nationalbank (Projekt Nr. 9382), bei dem vor allem die Popularisierung dieser Instrumente im Vordergrund stand. Von den ersten Versuchen ausgehend, wird anhand von sorgfältig recherchierten Originaldokumenten die Entwicklung im untersuchten geographischen Raum vorzugsweise im Zeitintervall von 1920 bis 1945 behandelt. Nach einer kurzen Darstellung der ins 19. Jh. zurückreichenden Wurzeln beginnt die Untersuchung mit einer kritischen Wertung der Konstruktionen und deren Präsentation in den 1920er Jahren (insbesondere Jörg Mager, Lev Termen und den Reaktionen der Fachwelt und der Öffentlichkeit). Dazu kommen Konstruktionen, die zwar in dieser Zeit entstanden, jedoch erst später in Erscheinung traten: die elektro-optische und elektromagnetische Tonerzeugung. Für beide Prinzipien gibt es Beispiele in Österreich und Deutschland, die in die 1920er Jahre zurückreichen. Eine repräsentative Presseschau zeigt die unterschiedliche Auffassung der Verwertbarkeit der elektrischen Instrumente vom Standpunkt der Techniker, der Musiker und der Öffentlichkeit. Das folgende Jahrzehnt wird der politischen Entwicklung wegen in mehreren Teilen behandelt. Die ersten zwei Jahre waren vor allem von der Erfindung des Trautoniums, des Neo-Bechstein-Flügels, des Elektrochords und des Hellertions geprägt. In dieser Zeit entwickelte sich Berlin (insbesondere durch das Heinrich Hertz Institut und die Rundfunkversuchsstelle) zu einem Zentrum der ""elektrischen Musik"". Auch die ersten großen öffentlichen Präsentationen auf den Berliner Funkausstellungen fanden 1931 und 1932 statt. Nach 1933 veränderte sich jedoch nicht nur die politische Lage, sondern auch die kulturpolitischen Voraussetzungen für die Verwendung elektrischer Instrumente. Die politische Nähe zum NS Regime und das Wohlwollen des Propagandaministeriums spielten eine wesentliche Rolle. Die Entwicklung zeigte, dass das Trautonium, die Orgelkonstruktionen von Oskar Vierling und das Hellertion Bruno Helbergers im offiziellen Musikbetrieb weiter verwendet wurden. Vierlings ""Großtonorgel"" wurde bei offiziellen Anlässen eingesetzt, hingegen wurde die Entwicklung der Lichttonorgel Edwin Weltes gestoppt, weil er mit einer Jüdin verheiratet war. Oskar Salas Arbeit spielt im Spannungsfeld zwischen Technik, Politik und Musik eine wichtige Rolle. Nachdem bislang keine ausführliche Dokumentation der Arbeit Jörg Magers (der für sich eine besondere Rolle in Anspruch nahm) verfügbar war, ist diesem Thema ein eigenes Kapitel gewidmet. Einer kurzen Darstellung der Folgewirkungen nach 1945 folgt ein ausführlicher Anhang, der das ermittelte Material offenlegt: Aufführungsdaten, Tondokumente, technische Dokumentationen und über 600 Patente werden aufgelistet. Die Arbeit beruht auf umfangreichem Originalmaterial, da es sich beim Studium der Sekundärliteratur zeigte, dass viele Details auf nicht weiter nachvollziehbaren Quellen beruhen. Die Fakten sind sorgfältig in Fußnoten dokumentiert, das Buch versteht sich daher auch als grundlegende Quellensammlung für weiterführende wissenschaftliche Arbeit.

Musikalische Repertoires in Zentraleuropa,Björn Renko Tammen,music,First published in 2014,/works/OL23502145W,/authors/OL8012602A/Björn_Renko_Tammen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Böhlau|Pages 422,"With famous music manuscripts such as the St Emmeram codex or the Trent codices and the rise of a musical elite with singer-composers around Dufay and Binchois, the years around 1430 belong to a crucial period in late-medieval music history. The present volume comprises 13 case studies on polyphonic as well as monophonic repertories with a particular focus on the city of Vienna. For the first time, the ‘simultaneity’ of ‘non-simultaneous’ phenomena is scrutinized for Central Europe and for the cultural exchange with neighbouring territories of the Holy Roman Empire, of England, Bohemia and Northern Italy.Due to its specific urban profile and the geographical position, late-medieval Vienna offers an excellent starting point for the study of musical repertories in Central Europe and their appropriation as cultural practice in the first half of the fifteenth century. The ‘simultaneity’ of ‘non-simultaneous’ phenomena is closely connected to the coexistence of different patterns of music patronage within court and nobility, the university, a variety of ecclesiastical institutions (among them the collegiate church of All Saints, later St Stephen’s Cathedral), and diverse strands of upper- and middle-class citizens on the one hand, cultural exchange with neighbouring territories of the Holy Roman Empire, of England, Bohemia and Northern Italy on the other. Manifold strands of polyphonic and monophonic repertories (both sacred and profane), compositional techniques, regionally bound stylistic peculiarities, strategems of music patronage, institutional (or even personal) collectionism, furthermore aspects of music iconography and the role of music within the history of ideas are scrutinized in thirteen chapters, which are conceived as case-studies, plus a detailed thematical introduction. In sum, this is an invaluable contribution to a better understanding of a crucial period of late-medieval music history.  Mit berühmten Repertoire-Handschriften wie dem Mensuralcodex St. Emmeram oder den Trienter Codices und der Entstehung einer musikalischen Elite um Sängerkomponisten wie Dufay und Binchois gehören die Jahrzehnte um 1430 zu einer Schlüsselphase der abendländischen Musikgeschichte. Der Band vereint 13 Fallstudien zur polyphonen Kunstmusik sowie zum einstimmigen Lied, wobei ein besonderer Fokus auf den Verhältnissen in Wien liegt. Erstmals wird so die Gleichzeitigkeit ungleichzeitiger Phänomene für Zentraleuropa beleuchtet – auch hinsichtlich der Wechselwirkungen mit England, Böhmen, Oberitalien und dem franko-flämischen Raum.

Vielmehr ist der Musikskandal ein kultureller Störfall und ein ästhetisches Ereignis. Er überschreitet nicht nur die künstlerischen und moralischen Grenzen des guten Tons, sondern greift zudem gesellschaftliche Normen auf und an. Anna Schürmer analysiert diese Verschränkung und nutzt das interdisziplinäre Potential, das der klingende Eklat als konfliktiver Seismograf sozialer Problem- wie ästhetischer Experimentierfelder bereithält. An der Schnittstelle von Geschichts- und Musikwissenschaften fokussiert die medienkulturwissenschaftlich inspirierte Studie den prismatischen Gegenstand des klingenden Eklats vor dem akustischen Hintergrund nicht nur der musikalischen Moderne.; Sound éclats push good sound (and good manners) to the limit; they serve as seismographs of social problems as well as aesthetic experiments, sounding out the acoustic dimensions of modern day.

In the main part then the meaning of music in Pasternak's poetry is to be examined in a double sense - on technical-stylistic and on motivic level, where in the first area in addition to the formative means of poetry (such as metric, rhyming and stanza forms) and certain methods of special coupling be analyzed by sound and meaning. The second part of the main part, in addition to the ""real"" music history in Pasternak's poetry (such as the mention of composer names and musical instruments), includes the study of literary leitmotifs associated with music, such as birds, wind, water, sound and silence  Thema dieser Abhandlung ist die Untersuchung der Bezüge zwischen Musik und Dichtung in der Lyrik Pasternaks. Im Hauptteil soll sodann die Bedeutung der Musik in Pasternaks Lyrik in doppeltem Sinne untersucht werden - auf verstechnisch-stilistischer und auf motivischer Ebene, wobei im ersten Bereich neben den Formmitteln der Lyrik (wie Metrik, Reim- und Strophenformen) auch bestimmte Verfahren der besonderen Koppelung von Laut und Bedeutung analysiert werden. Der zweite Bereich des Hauptteils umfaßt neben der ""realen"" Musikgeschichte in Pasternaks Lyrik (etwa der Erwähnung von Komponistennamen und Musikinstrumenten) vor allem die Untersuchung literarischer Leitmotive, die mit der Musik in Verbindung stehen, wie insbesondere Vögel, Wind, Wasser, Klang und Stille.

"Eduard Hanslick : Sämtliche Schriften, Historisch-kritische AusgabeBand I, 7",Dietmar Strauß,music,First published in 2011,/works/OL23501656W,/authors/OL8012984A/Dietmar_Strauß,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Böhlau|Pages 610,"The present seventh volume of the new historical-critical complete edition of Eduard Hanslick's works contains texts of the years 1864 to 1865, which are for the most part contributions from the Vienna ""Presse"" and the ""Neue Freie Presse"", which Hanslick changed to when it was founded in 1864.     In terms of content the texts offer a wide range. Apart from topical reviews there are basic essays on musical aesthetics, thoughts on the Italian opera in Vienna, historico-cultural accounts as well as basic reflections about the concert life in Vienna at that time. In particular Hanslick's research on the history of music in Vienna, which leads to ""Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien"" published by Wilhelm Braumüller in 1869, shows in various single essays and a huge coherent series in ""Oesterreichische Revue"".    Some articles were published shortly after in national music journals such as the ""Niederrheinische Musik-Zeitung"" or the Berlin music journal ""Echo"". Later Hanslick revised some of them for his well-known anthologies (""Die moderne Oper"", ""Aus dem Concertsaal. Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien, II""). As before these texts were provided with lists of readings, which are printed subsequent to the respective article. The principles of publication did not change. Minor variations are: different spelling, change from spaced writing to normal distance of characters or vice versa, slight modifications of the wording, updating or additions. Major changes mainly consist in leaving out large parts of the text or rearranging text passages from different sources regarding particular subjects. The basic change in Hanslick's occupation as a critic that is his stronger attention to reviewing the performance, - as can be seen from the 1860s in particular - cannot be substantiated so well by his own editions, because he often left out parts related to the concert. From that point of view this edition not only provides a better overview of the Vienna concert life in these years than Hanslick's own edition but it also notes down in a much more precise way his changed approach to writing. Most of the texts, however, are completely unknown today.  The essay in the comment part deals with Hanslick's change to the ""Neue Freie Presse"" and the importance of the latter for the circle of its authors.    As before the notes characterize every single text briefly and analyse them according to their aesthetic relevance.     The volume ends with a scientific apparatus (list of emended printing errors, list of abbreviations, bibliography and index of names).  Der vorliegende siebte Band der neuen historisch-kritischen Gesamtausgabe der Schriften von Eduard Hanslick enthält Texte der Jahre 1864 bis 1865. Es sind überwiegend Beiträge aus der Wiener ""Presse"" und der ""Neuen Freien Presse"", zu der Hanslick mit der Gründung im Jahr 1864 wechselte.     Inhaltlich sind die Texte weit gestreut. Neben Tageskritiken stehen grundsätzliche musikästhetische Essays, Gedanken zur italienischen Oper in Wien, kulturhistorische Darstellungen, aber auch grundsätzliche Reflexionen zum aktuellen Wiener Konzertleben. Insbesondere seine Forschungen zur Wiener Musikgeschichte, die zu der 1869 bei Wilhelm Braumüller erschienenen ""Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien"" führen, sind in dieser Zeit mit verschiedenen Einzelessays und einer großen zusammenhängenden Reihe in der ""Oesterreichischen Revue"" dokumentiert.    Manche Artikel erschienen kurz darauf in überregionalen Musikzeitschriften wie der ""Niederrheinischen Musik-Zeitung"" oder der Berliner Musikzeitung ""Echo"". Einen Teil überarbeitete Hanslick später für seine bekannten Sammelbände (""Die moderne Oper"", ""Aus dem Concertsaal. Geschichte des Concertwesens in Wien, II""). Für diese Texte wurden wie bisher Lesartenverzeichnisse erstellt, die im Anschluss an die jeweiligen Zeitungsartikel abgedruckt sind. Die Editionsprinzipien blieben gleich. Geringfügigere Varianten sind: andere Schreibweise, Wechsel von Sperrdruck zu normalem Zeichenabstand oder umgekehrt, kleinere Formulierungsänderungen, Aktualisierungen oder Hinzufügungen. Gravierende Änderungen bestehen hauptsächlich im Wegfall großer Textpartien oder der Neumontage von Textpassagen aus verschiedenen Quellen zu bestimmten Themen. Die grundsätzliche Änderung in Hanslicks Kritikertätigkeit, wie sie gerade ab den 1860-er Jahren festzustellen ist, nämlich seine stärkere Zuwendung zur Leistungskritik, kann man an seinen eigenen Editionen nicht so gut belegen, weil er oft aufführungsbezogene Teile weggelassen hat. Insofern gibt diese Ausgabe nicht nur einen besseren Überblick über das Wiener Konzertleben dieser Jahre als Hanslicks eigene Edition, sondern verzeichnet viel genauer seine geänderte Schreibhaltung. Die meisten Texte jedoch sind heute gänzlich unbekannt.    Der Essay im Kommentarteil beschäftigt sich mit Hanslicks Wechsel zur ""Neuen Freien Presse"", ihrer Bedeutung im Umfeld ihrer Autoren. Die Erläuterungen kommentieren wie bisher die einzelnen Texte knapp und befragen sie auf ihre ästhetische Relevanz hin.    Der Band schließt mit einem wissenschaftlichen Apparat (Verzeichnis der emendierten Druckfehler, Abkürzungsverzeichnis, Literaturverzeichnis und Personenindex).

Noise in and as music,,music,,/works/OL20931806W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  University of Huddersfield Press|Language English|Pages 238,"One hundred years after Luigi Russolo?s ?The Art of Noises,? this book exposes a cross-section of the current motivations, activities, thoughts, and reflections of composers, performers, and artists who work with noise in all of its many forms. The book?s focus is the practice of noise and its relationship to music, and in particular the role of noise as musical material?as form, as sound, as notation or interface, as a medium for listening, as provocation, as data. Its contributors are first and foremost practitioners, which inevitably turns attention toward how and why noise is made and its potential role in listening and perceiving. Contributors include Peter Ablinger, Sebastian Berweck, Aaron Cassidy, Marko Ciciliani, Nick Collins, Aaron Einbond, Matthias Haenisch, Alec Hall, Martin Iddon, Bryan Jacobs, Phil Julian, Michael Maierhof, Joan Arnau Pàmies, and James Whitehead (JLIAT).  The book also features a collection of short responses to a two-question ?interview???what is noise (music) to you?? and ?why do you make it???by some of the leading musicians working with noise today. Their work spans a wide range of artistic practice, including instrumental, vocal, and electronic music; improvisation; notated composition; theater; sound installation; DIY; and software development. Interview subjects include Eryck Abecassis, Franck Bedrossian, Antoine Chessex, Ryan Jordan, Alice Kemp (Germseed), George Lewis, Lasse Marhaug, Maja Solveig Kjelstrup Ratkje, Diemo Schwarz, Ben Thigpen, Kasper Toeplitz, and Pierre Alexandre Tremblay.

Die Texte des vorliegenden Bandes fassen einige der Freien Referate zusammen, die beim 15. Internationalen Kongress der Gesellschaft für Musikforschung ?Music | Musics. Structures and Processes? vom 5.?8. September 2012 in Göttingen gehalten worden sind. Mit Beiträgen von Merle Fahrholz, Axel Fischer und Matthias Kornemann, Melanie von Goldbeck, Christine Hoppe, Martin Knust und Ingela Tägil, Marie Winkelmüller und Christhard Zimpel.

Reflexion - Improvisation - Multimedialität Band 2 - Kompositionsstrategien in der Musik des 20. und 21. Jahrhunderts,Christian Storch,music,,/works/OL20932206W,/authors/OL7465225A/Christian_Storch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language German,"Die Musik des 20. und bisherigen 21. Jahrhunderts ist geprägt von einer nie dagewesenen Komplexität kompositorischer Ansätze, die mit dem Aufbrechen der herkömmlichen Dur-Moll-Tonalität begann und mit den multimedialen Möglichkeiten des neuen Jahrhunderts noch lange nicht zu Ende ist. Auch die vor allem nach 1950 eingetretene fundamentale Wandlung ästhetischer Positionen aufgrund gesellschaftlicher Umbrüche hat ihre Spuren in der Musik hinterlassen. Der Begriff der Musik entwickelte sich im Laufe des 20. Jahrhunderts zu einem vielschichtigen Topos pluraler Musiken, basierend u.a. auf neuen kompositorischen Mitteln, interkulturellen Begegnungen, unterschiedlichen medialen Zugängen und nicht zuletzt einem Wandel ästhetischer Rezeptionsmechanismen. Im vorliegenden Band werden Referate zu diesem Themenkomplex aus der Rubrik ?Freie Referate? des 15. Internationalen Kongresses der Gesellschaft für Musikforschung, der vom 4.?8. September 2012 in Göttingen unter dem Motto ?Musik | Musiken. Strukturen und Prozesse? stattfand, zusammengefasst. Das Panorama reicht dabei von Fragen nach einer kompositorischen Spätstilistik, kulturellen Austauschprozessen, musikalischen Grenzerfahrungen und intermedialen Exotismen bis hin zu multimedialen Klanginstallationen und Musiktheaterkompositionen und dem damit verbundenen Aufbrechen tradierter Gattungsgefüge.

Through readings of Nancy Huston, Maryse Condé, J. M. Coetzee, Assia Djebar, Julio Cortázar, and other late twentieth-century novelists, the book shows how writers deploy musical strategies to expand the possibilities of the novel in response to the demands of transnational citizenship. The book transcends disciplinary boundaries, to reveal the entanglement of musical and narrative forms in ethical, historical, and political questions.  Critics from Mikhail Bakhtin to Edward Said established musical forms as an indispensable framework for understanding the novel. This study argues that the turn to music in late twentieth century fiction is linked to new questions of authority and representation, as writers seek to democratize the novel, to bring marginalized voices into fiction, to articulate increasingly hybrid subjectivities, and to negotiate the conflicting histories of the diverse groups that make up today's multicultural societies. The book traces the influence of four musical concepts on theory and the contemporary novel: polyphony, or the art of combining multiple, equal voices; counterpoint, the carefully regulated setting of one voice against another; variations, the virtuosic exploration of a given theme; and opera, the dramatic setting of a story to a musical score. Borrowed Forms is both a vital reference for all those seeking to understand the influence of music on 20th-century literary theory, and a rigorous and interdisciplinary framework for considering the transnational novel.

OPEN MUSIC THEORY,Mark Gotham,music,First published in 2021,/works/OL27776375W,/authors/OL10365502A/Mark_Gotham,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37936336M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2021-07-01|Publisher  VIVA Open Publishing|Language English,"Open Music Theory Version 2 (OMT2) is an open educational resource intended to serve as the primary text and workbook for undergraduate music theory curricula. As an open and natively-online resource, OMT2 is substantially different from other commercially-published music theory textbooks, though it still provides the same content that teachers expect from a music theory text.OMT2 has been designed inclusively. For us, this means broadening our topics beyond the standard harmony and atonal theory topics to include fundamentals, musical form, jazz, pop, and orchestration. And within those traditional sections of harmony and atonal theory, the authors have deliberately chosen composers who represent diverse genders and races. The book is accessible. And perhaps most importantly, the book is completely free and always will be.The text of the book is augmented with several different media: video lessons, audio, interactive notated scores with playback, and small quizzes are embedded directly into each chapter for easy access.OMT2 introduces a full workbook to accompany the text. Almost every chapter offers at least one worksheet on that topic. Some chapters, especially in the Fundamentals section, also collect additional assignments that can be found on other websites.Version 2 of this textbook is collaboratively authored and edited by Mark Gotham, Kyle Gullings, Chelsey Hamm, Bryn Hughes, Brian Jarvis, Megan Lavengood, and John Peterson. <i>Open Music Theory</i> is a natively-online open educational resource intended to serve as the primary text and workbook for undergraduate music theory curricula. <i>OMT2</i> provides not only the material for a complete traditional core undergraduate music theory sequence (fundamentals, diatonic harmony, chromatic harmony, form, 20th-century techniques), but also several other units for instructors who have diversified their curriculum, such as jazz, popular music, counterpoint, and orchestration. This version also introduces a complete workbook  of assignments.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Walter Scott operas,Jerome Mitchell,music,First published in 1977,/works/OL2984368W?edition=ia%3Awalterscottopera0000mitc,/authors/OL456892A/Jerome_Mitchell,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21337681M-M.jpg,Pages 402,"The Walter Scott Operas is a study of the approximately 50 operas that are based on the works of Sir Walter Scott, who, except for Shakespeare, inspired more operas than any other writer. Professor Mitchell's scholarly method is literary-historical (rather than ""critical"") and unabashedly antiquarian. He shows what happened to a Scott novel when it was turned into an opera and how that opera compared and contrasted with others based on the same novel -- all this leading to a fresh slant on Scott's characters and the structure of his novels. The Scott operas are all products of the nineteenth century, and indeed span the century from Rossini's La Donna del Lago (1819) to several done in the 1890s. The operas vary in style from typical early nineteenth-century romantic opera and opera comique to the Wagner-influenced works of the latter part of the century. Each discussion of an opera begins with a brief account of its performance history, but the major part of the discussion is concerned with what ""happened"" to the novel (poem, novella, or historical work) when it was transformed into an opera. What did the librettist do to the original story -- how did he reshape it -- to make it something the operatic composer could felicitously handle? The concluding chapter brings together for final discussion the elements in Scott's works that are conducive to good opera -- the pictorial element; the theme of ""opposing fanaticism,"" often brought vividly to life in one or more major scenes of drama; the well-drawn characters, from both high and low life; the theatrical direct discourse, including soliloquies. In addition, the concluding chapter tries to determine what influence the Scott operas have had on others now in the standard repertoire. Many parallels can be observed because of the use of certain operatic conventions that are part of the common stock of virtually all librettists and composers. Other parallels, however, are directly traceable to the Scott operas. - Jacket flap.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here is its story from the inside -- a story filled with drama, humor, danger, compassion, and, of course, glorious music. A player who studies and performs the exalted string-quartet repertoire has opted for a very special life. Arnold Steinhardt, tracing his own development as a student, orchestra player, and budding young soloist, gives a touching account of how he and his intrepid colleagues were converted to chamber music despite the daunting odds against success. And he reveals, as no one has before, the intensely difficult process by which -- on the battlefield of daily three-hour rehearsals -- four individualists master and then overcome the confining demands of ensemble playing. - Back cover.

First Avenue,Chris Riemenschneider,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19726858W,/authors/OL7528908A/Chris_Riemenschneider,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 263,"One of the longest running clubs in American rock 'n' roll, First Avenue in Minneapolis finally gets the rock-star treatment it deserves in print. This book chronicles the club's storied past, beginning with its impressive inaugural show in April 1970 (Joe Cocker's ""Mad Dogs & Englishmen"" tour) and through its oft-maligned disco era of the late 1970s. In the 1980s, it earned global attention as the hub of Prince's ""Purple Rain"" and the incubator for widely revered, wild-eyed indie-rock bands such as the Replacements, Hüsker Dü, Soul Asylum, and Babes in Toyland. The Ramones and R.E.M., Chrissie Hynde and Lauryn Hill, Wilco and the Wu-Tang Clan, and hundreds more played the hallowed halls of First Avenue and 7th Street Entry, and all are immortalized in this volume. First Avenue survived corporate competitors, bankruptcy, and a bitter ownership battle to become one of the most successful independent clubs in the country and ground zero to Minneapolis's thriving community of hip-hop and indie-rock acts. Amidst all that history, the book is interlaced with anecdotes, quotes, and occasionally cloudy memories from musicians, employees, and regulars--many of whom are as unique as the club itself. Chock full of concert photos and memorabilia collected from professional photographers and average fans alike, the book is a lavish celebration of a rock 'n' roll landmark.

Austrians allegedly are also stuck in the past (see Chapter 1 ). This would    explain Kruder and Dorfmeister’s penchant for making capital from our pleasure    of listening to melodies we already know, if not for the fact that they gained fame    not from capitalising on Vienna’s music history but remixing songs coming from    the Anglo-American centre of popular music, such as those by Depeche Mode,    Madonna and David Holmes. Theirs is thus an interesting case of colonisation,    which includes self-colonisation and reverse colonisation: taking something from    the centre, reworking it and returning to the centre an improved version. Depending    on the perspective, their productions can be seen as proof of the hegemony of    the centre or a sign that the periphery can not only resist the centre’s power but    also penetrate it on its own terms. Equally, they can be seen as a sign of the end of    authenticity and originality in popular music (and art at large) in the postmodern    era or a need to rework these concepts to fit the art of creative recycling.

Modernist music was condemned as degenerate by the Nazis and forcibly replaced by socialist realism under the Soviets. Sympathetic philosophers and critics have interpreted it as a vital intellectual defence against totalitarianism, yet some American critics consider it elitist, undemocratic, and even unnatural. Drawing extensively on the philosophy of Heidegger and Badiou, Quilting Points proposes a new dialectical theory of faithful, reactive, and obscure subjective responses to musical modernism, which embraces all the music of Western modernity.

She's the drummer. In comes Jimmy Destri from Blondie. He thinks the Student Teachers are terrific! And then he falls in love with Laura. He pulls her into the glamorous life of Blondie and introduces her to David Bowie. Bowie takes an interest in Laura's band, attends their rehearsals, and sets them up to open for Iggy Pop at the Palladium on Halloween 1979. It's the beginning of amazing success in rock 'n' roll!

Part chronicle of an extraordinary life and part spiritual and philosophical discourse, The Tao of Wu is a nonfiction Siddhartha for the hip-hop generation —an engaging, seeking book that will enlighten, entertain, and inspire.The legions of Wu-Tang fans are accustomed to this heady mix—their obsession with the band's puzzlelike lyrics and elaborate mythology has propelled the group through fifteen years of dazzling, multiplatform success. In his 2005 bestseller The Wu-Tang Manual, the RZA provided the barest glimpse of how that mythology worked. In The Tao of Wu, he takes us deep inside the complex sense of wisdom and spirituality that has been at the core of his commercial and creative success.The book is built around major moments in the RZA's life when he was faced with a dramatic turning point, either bad (a potential prison sentence) or good (a record deal that could pull his family out of poverty), and the lessons he took from each experience. His points of view are always surprising and provocative, and reveal a profound, genuine, and abiding wisdom—consistently tempered with humor and peppered with unique, colloquial phraseology. It is a spiritual memoir as the world has never seen before, and will never see again.   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

Tens of millions of young people quickly signed on, Time magazine put Fanning on its cover, and his company, Napster, became a household name. It did not take long for the music industry to declare war, one that has now engulfed the biggest entertainment and technology companies on the planet.  For All the Rave, top cyberculture journalist Joseph Menn gained unprecedented access to Fanning, other key Napster and music executives, reams of internal e-mails, unpublished court records, and other resources. The result is the definitive account of the Napster saga, for the first time revealing secret take-over and settlement talks, the unseen role of Shawnâ€™s uncle in controlling Napster, and hidden agendas and infighting from Napsterâ€™s trenches to the top ranks of the German media giant Bertelsmann.  All the Rave is a riveting account of genius and greed, visionary leaps and disastrous business decisions, and the clash of the hacker and investor cultures with that of the copyright establishment. Napster left a generation of music fans feeling that paying the recording industry close to twenty dollars for a CD was a foolish and unnecessary extravagance, which provoked a still-growing backlash against digital media consumers that might leave them with less control than ever. Here is the inside story of the young visionary and the company that made it happen. --Goodreads Synopsis   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Riley offers a new, deeper understanding of the Beatles by closely considering each song and album they recorded in an exploration as rigorous as it is soulful. He tirelessly sifts through the Beatles discography, making clear that the legendary four were more than mere teen idols: They were brilliant innovators who mastered an extremely detailed art. Since the first publication of Tell Me Why in 1988, much new primary source material has appeared—Paul McCartney's authorized biography, the Anthology CDs and videos, the complete Parlophone-sequenced albums on CD, the Live at the BBCsessions, and the global smash 1. Riley incorporates all the new material in an update that makes this a crucial book for Beatles fans.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

As Details magazine said when it named Rollins the 1994 Man of the Year: ""through two decades of rage and discipline, Henry Rollins has transformed himself from an L.A. punk rocker into a universal soldier.  His enemies: slackers and hypocrites.  His mission: to steel your soul and rock your world.""Rollins was frontman for the seminal punk band Black Flag, and since 1987 has led the Rollins Band, whose ninth album, Come In and Burn, was just released by DreamWorks.As a spoken-word artist, he regularly performs at colleges and theaters worldwide and has released eight spoken-word audiotapes.  His album Get in the Van won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album for 1995.  As an actor, he has appeared in The Chase, Johnny Mnemonic, Heat, and David Lynch's forthcoming film, Lost Highway.  From his days as front man for the band Black Flag and the current Rollins Band to his books and spoken-word audiotapes, Henry Rollins is the music, the attitude, and the voice that takes no prisoners.  In his twelve books, he has led us on a hallucinatory journey through the decades--and his mind--with poems, essays, short stories, diary entries, and rants that exist at ""the frayed edges where reality ends and imagination begins"" (Publishers Weekly).  For the first time, the best of his legendary, no-holds-barred writings are available.  This collection includes new photos and works from such seminal Rollins books as:High Adventure in the Great OutdoorsArt to Choke HeartsBang!Black Coffee BluesGet in the VanDo I Come Here Often?SolipsistPlus never before released stories and more...From the Trade Paperback edition.

Ze hebben met elkaar gemeen dat ze muziek laten klinken en dat ze historische figuren uit de Vlaamse geschiedenis (politieke iconen of schilders) als hoofdrolspelers opvoeren. Deze muziektheaterwerken werden onderworpen aan een tekstuele analyse, zowel op inhoudelijk, stilistisch als structureel niveau. Daarbij werd in het bijzonder aandacht geschonken aan de representatie van de historische figuren in de werken. De teksten van de muziektheaterwerken werden zoveel mogelijk in verband gebracht met hun historische context, in dit geval de Vlaamse, nationaal-didactische poëtica van de negentiende eeuw. Behalve de muziektheaterwerken (zangspelen) werden ook 12 'zuivere' muziekstukken (cantaten, liederen, ouverturen), waarin eveneens historische figuren centraal staan, bij het onderzoek betrokken.

Music beyond Airports,Monty Adkins,music,,/works/OL20926827W,/authors/OL8050193A/Monty_Adkins,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  University of Huddersfield Press|Language English|Pages 254,"This collection of essays has been assembled and developed from papers given at the Ambient@40 International Conference held in February 2018 at the University of Huddersfield. The original premise of the conference was not merely to celebrate Eno?s work and the landmark release of Music for Airports in 1978, but to consider the development of the genre, how it has permeated our wider musical culture, and what the role of such music is today given the societal changes that have occurred since the release of that album.  In the context of the conference, ambient was considered from the perspectives of aesthetic, influence, appropriation, process, strategy and activity. A detailed consideration of each of these topics could fill many volumes. With that in mind, this book does not seek to provide an in-depth analysis of each of these topics or a comprehensive history of the last 40 years of ambient music. Rather it provides a series of provocations, observations and reflections that each open up seams for further discussion. As such, this book should be read as a starting point for future research, one that seeks to critically interrogate the very meaning of ?ambient?, how it creates its effect, and how the genre can remain vital and relevant in twenty-first century music-making.

As the first volume in English to discuss and contextualise the topic of tone production on Early Modern lute instruments from a broad, interdisciplinary approach, it represents a unique and significant contribution to research on Early Music performance, particularly performance on lute instruments. At a lute-centred level, this book challenges many preconceptions about tone production by addressing the motivations behind certain choices made in and embraced by the Early Music community. It is therefore an essential ?desk reference? for both researchers and performers. At a meta-level, Informed Play offers a general perspective of how self-expressive acts, physical and social causes and effects can be perceived biologically to better understand historical music performance as a social practice and phenomenon.

""It offers to voodooists, as well as to all those who are interested in this religion, 1763 voodoo songs classified alphabetically from A to Z""    (Max Gesner Beauvoir, National Art)  Le Grand Recueil Sacré or Repertoire des Chansons du Vodou Haitien"". The Grand Sacred Collection contains words in Creole and in French and other words in language still spoken in the territories where our grandparents originate such as Benin, Tongo, Ghana... It is possible to access to an undetstanding of the culture of the Haitian people by travelling through the music described in the some five hundred pages that make up this masterful work. 1763 songs are transcribed in this work. It is a selection among an imposing number of songs and dance in the many Lakou of the country, where the 401 lwa parade. Songs for all occasions, songs that tell of rebellion like misery, songs that express struggles, hope, sadness, praise to the lwa, victories as well as defeats. In a word, it is committed and sacred music. All the rites and the ""Nations"", 21 in total, are served in this collection. From Rada to Nago, passing by Guedé, Pétro, Bizango, Makaya, Mahi and others. Most of the songs are addressed to God or dal with questions around the Supreme Being, the creator and conservator of the universe.

Ambos tipos de actividad cuentan en una alta proporción, con el material grabado que facilitará realizarlas.    Como complemento, texto y cassettes incluyen un Repertorio adicional (que el maestro podrá obviamente enriquecer), y un capítulo informativo sobre los conceptos musicales básicos y vocabulario que deben manejarse y desarrollar estos cursos. El repertorio en general incluye canciones tradicionales, infantiles, algunas latinoamericanas y varias originales.    1er. curso: Es, igual que el 2do., de carácter fuertemente participativo. Predominan la actividad rítmica (con el lenguaje hablado, elementos percusivos y movimiento corporal), la entonación de melodías sencillas y un contacto sensibilizador con la materia sonora. Se inicia la representación gráfica del sonido.    2do. curso: Las melodías para entonar por imitación adquieren mayor interés, y se intensifica el desarrollo del sentido rítmico. La representación de las alturas del sonido sigue en un nivel gráfico, pero se accede a los elementos más simples de la escritura rítmica convencional.    3er, curso: Pequeñas partituras de carácter gráfico, alternan con la interpretación o audición de fragmentos rítmicos y melódicos escritos en notación musical. Se realiza una aproximación más organizada a! mundo de los instrumentos, y comienza el estímulo a sencillas experiencias creativas.

"Music, Moving & Learning in Early Childhood: A Manual of Songs, Lesson Plans & Basic Theory for Teachers, Students and Parents of Young Children",Paula Melville-Clark,music,First published in 2008,/works/OL15177142W,/authors/OL6815127A/Paula_Melville-Clark,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24308939M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Electronic & Database Publishing, Inc.,              Music & Movement Education Aus|Language English|Pages 128","In her book, 'Music, Moving & Learning in Early Childhood,' well-known music educator Paula Melville-Clark presents a much needed resource for those involved in teaching music in early childhood. The book is written for educators, music specialists, parents and for anyone who has an interest in the potential of music and movement in the early years. Beautifully presented with photos, illustrations and colorful graphics, the book consists of three easy to use sections designed to make music teaching in the early years enjoyable and achievable.  The first section of the book covers the fundamental theory and practice of music and movement. It deals with the basic concepts that the adult should understand in order to teach music through movement effectively including chapters on understanding the elements of music, the elements of movement, the link between music and movement and understanding the voice. This section also discusses the developing child with information on general child development, music and multiple intelligence, the stages of motor and musical development and the sensory systems of learning. The learning environments in which children can be musically engaged are examined and the content and planning of guided music and movement sessions are discussed.  The second section of the book contains 32 sequential lesson plans for 3 – 5 year olds participating in guided music and movement sessions, enough for a whole year of planning. Colorfully and concisely presented, the lesson plans are easily adaptable for younger or older children and are an invaluable resource for novice or experienced teachers. The third section contains a music book that includes over 60 songs and chants composed by the author. These songs have been written specifically to support a movement and music approach while also tapping into the areas of development and intelligence. For those who do not read music or play an instrument, a CD is available by separate purchase from the publisher.  By providing a firm foundation and practical guide to the subject this book enables and encourages its readers to success. Student or novice teachers will find the skills and understanding necessary to become proficient in guiding young children’s musical experience and thought. More experienced teachers will find a plethora of new ideas, songs and activities to inspire their teaching. This is the book early childhood educators in Australia asked for. It’s a ‘must have’ for libraries, university teaching courses, kindergartens, early child care centers and families with young children.

This is her extraordinary story - full of rage, frustration, new love & cautious triumph - adapting to a life irretrievably changed.'Who are you when your brain is not you?'Jane Lapotaire is one of the lucky ones. Many people do not survive, let alone live intelligently and well again once they have suffered cerebral haemorrhage. In the long haul back to life - 'nearly dying was the easy bit' - she's learned much, some of it very hard lessons. Some friendships became casualties; family relations had to be redefined; and her work as an actress took a severe battering. The stress of living is felt that much more keenly when 'sometimes I still feel as if I am walking around with my brain outside my body. A brain still all too available for smashing by noise, physical jostling, or any form of harshness'. But she has survived and now believes it herself when people say how lucky she is.This is a very moving, darkly funny, honest book about what happens when the 'you' you've known all your life is no longer the same you.

Raised without her mother, she was a gospel prodigy who gave birth to two sons in her teens and left them and her native Detroit for New York, where she struggled to find her true voice. She found fame, fortune, and that remarkable voice in 1967 with ""Respect"" and a rapid-fire string of hits. Aretha turned the industry on its head by refueling pop with heavy soul. The Queen of Soul had survived, and arrived. In Respect, David Ritz uses exclusive interviews with her closest family, friends and associates to write movingly of Aretha's path and the extraordinary highs and deep lows she encountered along the way. Just as she was reestablishing her divadom in the 1980s with hist life ""Freeway of Love,"" personal tragedy--the deaths of her father, sisters and brother--threw her into isolation. Whenever it seems the Queen has relinquished her reign, she appears in scenes of ever greater drama and national significance. In 1998, when an ailing Luciano Pavarotti could not appear at the Grammy Awards, she came out of the shadows and stunned the world with a version of ""Nessun Dorma"" that was pure pop soul. From the moving elegies she performed at the funerals of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks to her dramatic performance at President Obama's first inauguration, Aretha has become our nation's voice. Again and again, Aretha Franklin stubbornly finds a way to triumph over troubles, conquering them even as they continue to build. Her hold on her crown is tenacious, and in Respect, David Ritz gives us the decisive and definitive study of one of the greatest talents in all of American culture.--Dust jacket flap.

"Die antike Konzeption des Liebesbegriffes in der deutschen und russischen Literatur und Musik im 19. Jahrhundert anhand der Werke von E. T. A. Hoffmann, A. Puschkin, R. Schumann und P. Tschaikowski",Julia Lukjanov,music,First published in 2010,/works/OL20933729W,/authors/OL8013035A/Julia_Lukjanov,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|Language German|Pages 245,"This work examines the expression of Love in an interdisciplinary approach to literature and music in Germany and Russia during the Romantic Period. The starting point is Socrates? classical discourse about Love and his definition of it, which Plato recorded in his Symposium. This will be applied to and examined in the Romantic Period, first in German and Russian literature and later in Music. What changes occur in the reception of this term? What differences or possible parallels can be determined in the two cultures and mentalities that are different at first sight? What is the influence of the respective artists on these changes? The results will be applied to the individual works of the writers A. Pushkin and E.T.A. Hoffmann as well as the musical settings of these works by the composers P. Tchaikovsky and R. Schumann. This examination, which is based primarily on literature and literary criticism, places the concept of Love in the foreground, even above the person or the work of the respective artist. Therefore, the primary goal of this work is to follow the reception of Plato?s ?theory of love? during the Romantic Period. The concepts of one?s own inconstancy, the development of beauty, and the path of love correspond with the metacognitive philosophy of the Romantics. The subject of love has particular significance today because of the media?s frequent discussions about the crisis of moral values. Love is transmedial. It transcends the subjective lives of humans, the objective external conditions, culture and mentality, literature and music; and it remains a desire, an ambition, an idea. Love is active and bridges every boundary as a communicational code or as nature?s utmost attempt to lead an individual out of himself and to another.

Son oeuvre met en lumière un important chapitre de l'histoire de la théorie musicale occidentale : celle du solfège (avant le mot) et du premier essai connu d'écriture musicale sur lignes que l'on peut déchiffrer avec sûreté.    Accompagnée de sa première traduction en langue française et d'un substantiel commentaire musicologique, cette édition critique de la Mvsica hucbaldienne complète l'édition de tous les grands traités latins de musique des IXe et Xe siècles.    Le musicien trouvera également dans ce livre, transcrits en notation moderne d'après l'ensemble de la tradition manuscrite la plus fiable, les plus anciens exemples de trope, de séquence (prosule) et d'office liturgique (historia) dont l'auteur est connu avec certitude.

Music beyond Airports,,music,,/works/OL20926826W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  University of Huddersfield Press|Language English|Pages 254,"This collection of essays has been assembled and developed from papers given at the Ambient@40 International Conference held in February 2018 at the University of Huddersfield. The original premise of the conference was not merely to celebrate Eno?s work and the landmark release of Music for Airports in 1978, but to consider the development of the genre, how it has permeated our wider musical culture, and what the role of such music is today given the societal changes that have occurred since the release of that album.  In the context of the conference, ambient was considered from the perspectives of aesthetic, influence, appropriation, process, strategy and activity. A detailed consideration of each of these topics could fill many volumes. With that in mind, this book does not seek to provide an in-depth analysis of each of these topics or a comprehensive history of the last 40 years of ambient music. Rather it provides a series of provocations, observations and reflections that each open up seams for further discussion. As such, this book should be read as a starting point for future research, one that seeks to critically interrogate the very meaning of ?ambient?, how it creates its effect, and how the genre can remain vital and relevant in twenty-first century music-making.

I assess the potential of Steiner's comments on the suitability of the interval of the fifth to guide the composition of music for young children. The five short pieces are representative of stages on the compositional journey I have undertaken during the doctoral process and show an emergent and evolving response to the interval of the fifth. The doctorate comprises a live performance of the pieces using harp and voice, plus an exegesis. A corpus of additional pieces composed during the doctoral period is included as an appendix.

In ""Kesa and Morito"" set in medieval Japan, two lovers sing of the ecstasy and torment of their illicit affair and their determination to end it that night. Neither knows the other's intent. ""R. Shomon"" set in 1951, New York City, follows the investigation of a crime of passion and the witnesses' contradicting versions of the event. An innocent bystander, a cunning thief, a flirtatious wife, a psychic, even the ghost of thte murdered man are all caught in a web of deceit, where everyone's truth may be a lie. ""Gloryday"" set in present-day New York City, introduces a priest during a crisis of faith after a terrible tragedy strikes the city. Disillusioned and angry, he plays a practical joke and posts an anonymous letter in Central Park, declaring that Christ will appear, rising from the pond. At first, the joke is embraced by an unstable CPA, who has chosen to live in the wilds of the park. Soon others begin to believe in the miracle, including a drug-addicted actress and a bitter reporter--even the priest's atheist aunt. On the day of the miracle, a storm blows through the Park, and only the priest sees his lie become a truth.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
