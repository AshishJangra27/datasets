T,Susan A. Barnett,photography,First published in 2014,/works/OL19999282W,/authors/OL7600366A/Susan_A._Barnett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English,"""With over 200 images of t-shirt 'messages', T: A Typology of T-shirts looks at those individuals who stand out in a crowd through their choice of the message on their back.  These photographs are not just about the T-shirt. With their combination of pictures and words these messages reveal much about the identity of the wearer. They tell us who they are, who they want to be and what they want us to know about them - their hopes, ideals, political views and personal mantras. Consequently the book is also a revealing and intriguing insight into the concerns and obsessions of our twenty-first century society.  By photographing from the back, Barnett challenges the time-honoured tradition of the portrait being of the face and tests whether body type, dress and demeanour can tell us just as much as any facial expression might. Begun in 2009, the project has taken Barnett to cities and tourist spots throughout the United States and Europe to record the ever-changing messages... The book includes texts by leading art critc, Marvin Heiferman, and by Harold Koda, Head Curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this metropolis of 14 million people, Valiasr Street represents the center of cultural life and is a major commercial center and nightlife area. Jörg Winde's photographic anecdotes, supplemented by short texts, depict the people who live and work along the street. The photographs reflect an attentiveness and closeness to the subjects and bear witness to the contradictory lives of people in Iran today. The close-ups of faces of people from a variety of backgrounds reveal how they openly and trustingly faced the photographer. Overviews and details in the surroundings provide us with deeper stories about the lives of these people. Large- format street views of urban traffic chaos against the scenic backdrop of the mighty, snow- covered Alborz Mountains complement the portraits. Mahmoud Dowlatabadi, the famous Iranian writer and observer of social conditions and the human psyche, contributes a personally- narrated essay for the volume. As well, Charotte Wiedemann, a journalist and author of books on Islamic culture, provides a knowledgeable and exciting historical account of Teheran, intertwined with her personal impressions.

It is self-defined as a project in documentary photography; it is a collaborative international exchange among institutions and artists; it is an educational initiative; it has resulted in art. As someone whose knowledge of Cuba comes, in part, from direct experience of the place and more from photographs of it, it has been my pleasure to take part in this effort, adding some historical context as well as a personal perspective. Towards, the end of this project, in the beginning of 2020, I took part in a symposium about it in Havana just before we all locked down. Now, a year later, I am writing for the catalogue. It's dark March in Cambridge; Cuba and the person I was when I went there seem very far away.

Photo Rhine Ruhr will examine the relationships between the different photographic positions that have developed in the cities of the Rhineland as well as the Ruhr and at the regions? art academies since the 1960s. This unique approach is due to the fact that such a rich photography scene was able to develop in western Germany, which has repeatedly produced new and innovative artistic positions with sometimes very different photographic approaches over the past 70 years. According to the thesis, on the one hand this is due to the density of art academies and trade schools that developed in the Rhine and Ruhr regions after the Second World War. On the other hand, it is also a result of artistic socialization through an intensive art-historical discourse, parallel artistic developments within the visual arts, and the engagement with positions of international art that were shown at the major institutions in Düsseldorf, Essen, Cologne, Krefeld, and Mönchengladbach.00Exhibition: Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany (21.03. - 14.06.2020).

Forschungspraktisch gesehen, so die unter Historikern nach wie vor verbreitete Meinung, seien die Bilder damit wertlos: Kein Kontext - folglich auch keine nach wissenschaftlichen Kriterien verwertbare Quelle. Doch stimmt das wirklich? Gibt es nicht doch Möglichkeiten, mit Fotografien zu arbeiten, etwas aus ihnen herauszulesen, obgleich eigentlich keinerlei Informationen zur Bildquelle erkennbar sind? Die Kommission Fotografie der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Volkskunde widmete sich mit ihrem Kooperationspartner, den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, in der 8. Tagung unter dem Thema 'Eine Fotografie. Über die transdisziplinären Möglichkeiten der Bildforschung' dem Blick und der Analyse einzelner Fotografien. Dem Ziel, Licht in das Dunkel jener Bilder zu bringen, über die ausser der visuellen Information keine weiteren Daten und Fakten überliefert sind, konnte mit den Beiträgen ein Stück näher gekommen werden""--Back cover.

The centerpiece of this stunning book is 'Homage', a series of 32 images that recreate the iconic works of photographers whose work inspired and influenced Miller, from Edward Curtis to Diane Arbus to Irving Penn to Annie Leibovitz. Malkovich's astonishing ability to channel others combines with Miller's technical mastery to produce images that transcend and amplify the originals, while creating something new and exciting in themselves. Bracketed by Miller's brilliant portraits of Malkovich as Malkovich, along with still work from a series of short films that the two made together, The Malkovich sessions is a marvellous record of friendship and inspiration.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For him, although it holds true that photography essentially entails making an image, it is hardly about making a representation of reality. Photography is about what something looks like after it has been photographed. In his ?reconstructed reality?, Tholens composes pieces of visible reality through images that are mirrored, repeated, and distorted. The collection of works in this book seem to place the viewer at a rational and emotional distance from a recognisable reality, thereby initiating a potentially complicated visual and associative play, with implications for meaning, cognition, and emotion within photography.

A childhood in 51 pictures,Kuba Rose,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32066231W,/authors/OL11632661A/Kuba_Rose,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  2066 Publishing|Language Swedish|Pages 112,"In 51 photographs Kuba Rose depicts his American cousin J's childhood from when he was born until his high school graduation. I's also a story about how J and his father carry on through a difficult divorce. How can a childhood be summarized in a series of images? How can memories even be depicted through photographs? And how do we know that memories are really memories and not memories of a photograph? These are questions that photographer Kuba Rose has been dwelling when photographing his only cousin and uncle. 'I know it's impossible to give a full picture of another person, especially only through photographs. But I've been fascinated by how my cousin and my uncle have carried on together all these years. After spending so much time together, they have grown very close to each other. My uncle even quit working to take care of his son. And after long periods of not feeling well, my cousin is now a young man who is doing well in life.' Included in the book is also an essay by literature scholar and editor Daniel Pedersen - To Develop a Childhood. He uses the works of Marcel Proust to try to understand how our memory works: 'So what can you do if you want to try and remember your childhood and how it was without the use of a memory medium: without photographs, films or conversations? Perhaps that is an almost impossible feat. What Proust reminds us of is the way in which chance opens up the path to remembrance'   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here, ""Breaking Point"" is about people waiting for their papers. After my project ""Exiles"" (2016-2017) in Lesbos and Agios Efstratios, I traveled regularly on the island Chios and then Leros, Athens and Oenofyta, between 2017 and 2019.0In Chios I quickly met Edmond and Feras. Both of my age and forced to live in Vial camp since a few months already, we were spending a lot of time together, and they explained to me the conditions on the island, the process to follow, and their hopes for the future. I met Mustapha at the same time and he directly introduced me to Soumaya, Sally, Razan and their family. They arrived at the same time than Edmond and Feras and were rehoused in a temporary apartment. Often invited at their place, I followed their file processing, the positive answer for Athens, the school enrollment and their concerns for the future. Following my project in Lesbos, I witnessed the situation getting worse for people arriving in Greece. Going there regularly, I saw my contacts loosing hope and having to face a system seeking to discourage them from staying or going further. 'Breaking Point' comes from the time I spent with Feras, lively talks with Edmond, afternoons spent with Mariam and her sisters, explanations from Mustapha, empty days and some full along Diallo and Sylla, difficult times, wonderings in Athens, exchanges inside Oenofyta camp with Nazar and in Vial with Sadam, and from the time granted by so many people. I see the publication of this book as a necessary achievement and allowing me to pay tribute to their resilience.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In 2000 he had to give up his profession as a taxi driver for health reasons. His life preserver was a colleague who told him that he was offering all kinds of darkroom attributes for sale. Michael made an offer, acquired the items and set up a dark room in the attic. There he developed the rolls of film that he filled with images from the city in the 1980s. There are now more than 50,000. Around the turn of the century, he exchanged his analogue camera for a digital one that gave his passion wings. Michael developed his own style in which he combined the raw edges of the city with beauty and an eye for the human condition. 'Each photo tells a story that you can fill in and complete it yourself. What preceded it? What happened next? - That makes the appearance of an image complete, because you are invited to come up with an imaginative frame for it yourself.' Exhibition: Beautiful Distress Foundation, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (14.04.-01.05.2021)  Straatfotograaf Michel van Oostende selecteerde uit zijn omvangrijke oeuvre aan straatfoto?s van Amsterdam de meest aangrijpende en vertederende beelden voor zijn fotoboek 'Amsterdam Street Photography'.00In 2000 moest hij zijn beroep als taxichauffeur om gezondheidsredenen opgeven. Zijn reddingsboei was een collega die hem vertelde dat hij allerlei attributen voor een donkere kamer te koop aanbod. Michael deed een bod, verwierf de spullen en richtte op zolder een donkere kamer in. Daar ontwikkelde hij de filmrolletjes die hij in de jaren ?80 volschoot met beelden uit de stad. Het zijn er inmiddels ruim vijftigduizend. Rond de eeuwwisseling verruilde hij zijn analoge camera voor een digitale variant waarmee hij zijn passie vleugels gaf.00Michael ontwikkelde een eigen stijl waarbij hij de rauwe randen van de stad combineerde met schoonheid en oog voor la condition humaine.00?Elke foto vertelt een verhaal dat je zelf kunt in- en aanvullen.

The print is large and probably aspires to be a billboard when it grows up. Next to it, a freshly manicured, white woman's hand with a translucent liquid dripping from it. Honey? Runny honey. Too much? Yes. Looking might arouse the viewer. Does that feel right, though? 'Too Familiar To Ignore, Too Different To Tolerate' by Christian Tunge is comprised of large photographic prints hyper-rich in detail and saturated in symbolism and references to contemporary pop culture and global politics. The same-titled book, launching in conjunction with this exhibition published on the artist?s own imprint, Heavy Books, informs the show with an even deeper dive into said references. Specific attention is given to examining the behavior of honey bees and the structure within the beehive to consider our human condition. Many poignant parallels can be drawn but it is perhaps more interesting to examine our own behavior in reaction to the work ? both on a personal and private level but also collectively while experiencing it in the gallery. The work confronts us with subjects and themes, which are hard to ignore and asks us, in turn, if we can tolerate our own response.

Il s'agit du premier livre qui traite de l'histoire de la photographie au Luxembourg depuis ses débuts vers le milieu des années 1840 jusqu'à la veille de la Première Guerre mondiale. Cette histoire culmine entre 1878 et 1910 avec l'atelier et l'imprimerie photographique de Charles Bernhœft, le plus grand établissement de ce genre qui ait jamais existé au grand-duché. Une description détaillée des procédés de tirage utilisés par le photographe luxembourgeois et des techniques d'impression de la photographie au XIXe siècle complètent cette étude et font de ce livre un ouvrage de référence incontournable.

Cependant, l'histoire de la photographie ne peut procéder par simple accumulation de ses objets. Il s'avère donc nécessaire de fédérer les approches et les thématiques, les régimes d'historicités et les courants théoriques. À travers quatorze articles de jeunes chercheurs de l'école doctorale d'histoire de l'art de l'université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne, cet ouvrage se propose d'explorer la notion d'expérience photographique, des questions statutaires soulevées par les premiers projets muséaux du Second Empire aux implications philosophiques des expérimentations photographiques les plus contemporaines.

As the title implies, the book is the revised and expanded imprint of the original title ""BLUE and other shapes"" from 2019. The original book certainly met with an enthusiastic response and in this second edition, the text is extended, giving greater depth and more explanation. Many photographs speak for themselves, others don't, and these need a helping hand. Since the first edition, the climate debate has intensified, and global temperatures have continued to rise unabated. The pandemic has swept across many different societies such that we ought to see new norms and lifestyle patterns emerging. New generations with new forthcoming technologies can be expected to introduce a new set of lifestyles and awareness rather than the one we have seen the back of. This book is an inspiration to that movement. Sustainability is one of the themes running through the essays that make up the narrative. Sustainability in broadest sense where the human, aesthetic side of sustainable quality is also brought into the picture. The book is about the human spirit as it is interpreted through the materials and substance of our built environment. The design of ""BLUE and other shapes 2"" introduces an original way of using images as a photographic debate about the future of our built environment. In many ways, this new style can be compared to a physical version of an online platform.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Het leidde tot de herontdekking van het verrassend veelzijdige en omvangrijke oeuvre van Maria Austria, een van de belangrijkste fotografen van Nederland in de 20ste eeuw. Zij was een veelgevraagd theaterfotografe, maar ook een briljant reportage-, straat- en portretfotograaf. Ze werd geboren in Wenen maar woonde en werkte tussen 1937 en 1975 in Amsterdam. 0Tijdens haar leven waren Austria's foto's zeer gewild. Ze verschenen regelmatig in dag- en weekbladen, tijdschriften, programmaboeken en jaaroverzichten. In tegenstelling tot haar vakbroeders heeft zij geen fotoboeken met eigen werk nagelaten. Er verschenen weliswaar twee thematische bundels in 1976 en 2001, maar dit boek is het eerste breed opgezette overzichtswerk van haar fotografie, met een groot aantal historische fotoreportages die tot nu toe weinig of niet bekend waren, zoals haar reportage over Het Achterhuis, over Terugkerende joden uit Westerbork, over De Watersnoodramp, het Joodse kinderkamp Ilaniah, Nijmegen in verval, Josephine Baker en twee Isräel-reportages.

They are miniature still lifes of seemingly insignificant subjects that coalesce in their diurnal sequence to form the world theater of daily life.

The past and future can have no influence on its power and immortality. Annelies de Mey has respect for the absoluteness of the mountain. She believes in the moment of encounter and waits for the moon, the sun and the snow. 'Black Mountain Conversations' offers the possibility to look at and experience the book in three different ways. If we flip the book backwards, we only see the soft, blue sky. If we flip the book from front to back we only see the Black Mountain. But if we just leaf through the book, the images of the mountain and the sky alternate each other. We experience the interaction between the enclosed landscape and the open sight of the sky.

'When I met Sophie, I was not only fascinated by her powerful, sculptural body but I was also drawn to her face which is sweet, feminine and tender. I felt that Sophie had a lot to say through her bodybuilding practice. It is, or at the time was, a reconstruction of herself in both an allegorical and a physical sense' Sophie embodies many of the qualities that the photographer seeks to convey through her work: the architectural nature of the bodybuilder's form encapsulates both the subject and object dynamic that so intrigues Vivier, while simultaneously blurring the boundaries between preconceived notions of femininity and masculinity. 'I felt that by reshaping herself with a very intimate, strong and personal motivation to feel good and comfortable with her own image, Sophie was reshaping the criteria of what the feminine body is supposed to be.'

The book is designed in such a way that the index and source list can be viewed while reading by opening the cover flaps. The numbers in the flaps refer to the numbers in the photos.

On each page is a silver line that divides the page into two columns, as Moengo was originally divided by population group. The color bronze has been used to symbolize bauxite, which was mined in Moengo, and the color silver to symbolize aluminum extracted from the bauxite.

Usos de la fotografía VII,Julio Grinblatt,photography,First published in 2020,/works/OL32316703W,/authors/OL11724887A/Julio_Grinblatt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Arta Ediciones|Language Spanish|Pages 251,"ulio Grinblatt gave an appointment for three weeks to meet him with his photographic archive of more than 900 photos to artists, galleries, museum directors, curators, writers and other personalities of Culture. Upon entering, the participant stays in front of a wooden table, where he faces several stacks and stacks of photos, carefully washes in inside transparent protectors. For file manipulation the artist requires the placement of white gloves of cotton. This action gives rise to the book Uses of Photography VII: Photos, which is part from a collection of the artist, called Uses of the photograph. The visual script is made up of 83 black and white photos. Each of the portraits are carefully copied to achieve great fidelity to the work of the artist. Includes two essays by Verónica Tell and Mónica Giron. Julio Grinblatt (b. 1960 in Buenos Aires, Argentina; lives Brooklyn, NY) has exhibited his work in solo and group exhibitions nationally and internationally for the past two decades, including in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Belgium, Finland, Belgium, Italy, and the United States. In 2001, Grinblatt mounted the solo exhibition Uses of Photography at the Museo de Arte Moderno de Buenos Aires (MAMBA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He has participated in group exhibitions at museums, such as MoMA PS1, El Museo del Barrio (both New York); Institute of Contemporary Art (Philadelphia, PA); Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art (Gainesville, FL); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid, Spain); Museum of Fine Arts (Brussels, Belgium); Amos Anderson Art Museum (Helsinki, Finland); and Museo de Arte Zapopan (Guadalajara, Mexico), among others.

Hij specialiseerde zich in architectuurfotografie, in de meest brede zin. Zijn artistiek werk focust voornamelijk op opvallende omgevingssituaties in het druk bebouwde Vlaanderen. Waar hij in vroeger werk met een rationele kijk naar gebouwen en locaties keek en een objectieve getuigenis vastlegde op de gevoelige plaat, zie je in zijn recenter werk een meer soepele benadering terugkomen. De foto's bevatten poëtische en licht ironische elementen die de relatie tussen natuur en gebouw duidelijker aantoont. In zijn eerste monografie toont Niels Donckers een selectie van zijn beste werk uit de periode 1994-2017.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A photographic art outside the academies' is the first presentation of the earliest Danish art photography, pictorialism: an ambiguous, evocative, intimate symbolist world of images created in the period 1890 to 1920. The book is the result of several years of research into an overlooked period of Danish photographic history. Pictorialism is described as photography's' second birth 'by virtue of the photographers' serious, artistically conscious preoccupation with the medium. It was a generation of artistically ambitious photographers with high ideals and passion for photography. In an international environment, they arranged exhibitions at home and abroad, and in the photographic amateur clubs, they educated themselves and sought out the latest knowledge about the technology and aesthetics of the medium. 'The Pictorialists. A photographic art outside the academies' uncovers an overlooked chapter in Danish photographic history and presents the pictorialists' serious and conscious work with photography, their thoughts on its uniqueness and artistic potential - in their own words. The book reproduces 45 representative examples of pictorialists' photographs, and it concludes with an essay by graphic artist and photographer Eli Ponsaing on photography as graphics and art. Tove Thage (b. 1950), master of arts and master's degree, photography historian and author of books and essays on Danish photography and art history based on source studies in Danish collections and archives.  Pictorialisterne. En fotografisk kunst uden for akademierne' er den første præsentation af det tidligste danske kunstfotografi, pictorialismen: en flertydig, stemningsfuld, intim symbolistisk billedverden skabt i perioden 1890 til 1920. Bogen er resultat af flere års forskning i en overset periode af dansk fotografihistorie. Pictorialismen betegnes som fotografiets 'anden fødsel' i kraft af fotografernes seriøse, kunstnerisk bevidste beskæftigelse med mediet. Det var en generation af kunstnerisk ambitiøse fotografer med høje idealer og passion for fotografi. I et internationalt miljø arrangerede de udstillinger i ind- og udland, og i de fotografiske amatørklubber skolede de sig selv og opsøgte den nyeste viden om mediets teknologi og æstetik. 'Pictorialisterne. En fotografisk kunst uden for akademierne' afdækker et overset kapitel i den danske fotografihistorie og fremlægger pictorialisternes seriøse og bevidste arbejde med fotografiet, deres tanker om dets egenart og kunstneriske potentiale - med deres egne ord. I bogen gengives 45 repræsentative eksempler på pictorialisternes fotografier, og den afsluttes med et essay af grafiker og fotograf Eli Ponsaing om fotografi som grafik og kunst.

The Kaliningrad?oblast? was a military area with heavily restricted access until 1991 and since the end of the USSR has been a Russian exclave isolated between the EU members Poland and Lithuania. On the simplest improvised stands old women offer what they harvest with their hands from their gardens, nearby fields and forests to supplement their feeble pensions. The pictures live from the aura of simplicity and plainness of the presentation of goods on the ground, on wooden boxes, newspapers or simple camping tables. Lia Darje?s pictures show what is on offer in a classic, almost timeless impression: Potatoes, apples, berries, owers, garlic tubers, homemade marmalade, and most exceptionally a piece of meat. Her still lives are complimented by a few portraits of market women and traders. With the pictures of Tempora Morte in her first photobook Lia Darjes aims to develop a relationship of the classical still life genre with contemporary documentary photography.

He is wary of presenting trophies, and despite similar moods, themes and coloring, new surprising motifs emerge, which are difficult to categorize in geographical and cultural terms. The starting point of his interest is mankind, even though it is seldom the focal point of his pictures. Unverzart photographs wonderfully poetically, operating on a fine line between narration and a void. He invites viewers to see for themselves and to pass on the stories. In this documentation of his travels over the past ten years he once again succeeds in revealing things that cannot be seen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

'Haven' tells the coming of age story of a boy in a rapidly changing environment, based on memories of surroundings that no longer exist. Sem Langendijk (NL) witnessed the unrooting effects of gentrification during his upbringing in the periphery of a large city. After the neighbourhood transformed into a waterfront, Langendijk realised he no longer identified with this area. He lost his connection to the place he lived in for nearly thirty years. This body of work is the result of a long-term research project into shifting demographics, waterfront development and the dynamics of gentrification. Due to social inequality and urbanisation, people are continuously driven to relocate, particularly within post-industrial cities. Haven brings together the environments of different port cities in a documentary fiction, highlighting the transformation of disused docklands and the communities that reside there. A second chapter contains the background research, providing context for the personal testimony that makes up the first part.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Upon closer examination, the viewer becomes aware that all images are taken through a train window. The photographer's journey, which takes him from Ukraine to Oslo through present-day Europe, is inspired by train journeys taken by relatives in 1945 and 1978, leading them to death or freedom. At this point in all three journeys, each family member turned 45. The book's narrative challenges the issue of forced immigration within the boundaries of Europe's past and present. Eight months after the author's return in 2013, a new conflict erupted in the Donetsk region, leading to an ongoing war.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Att skriva med ljus,Johan Gardfors,photography,First published in 2020,/works/OL32066150W,/authors/OL11632597A/Johan_Gardfors,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Makadam|Language Swedish|Pages 320,"The birth of photography in the 19th century was a decisive event in the history of visual arts - a media-technological revolution that also changed the conditions for literary creation. The continued collaboration of literature and photography left deep traces in the field of artistic production during the 20th and 2000s. Some of its expressions and effects are discussed in 'Writing with light', where Swedish, Danish and Norwegian authors move from the photographer Nadar's memoirs to the filmmaker Wim Wender's photo texts with hits by, among others, Gertrude Stein, André Breton, Ivar Lo-Johansson, Asger Jorn and Elias Canetti  Fotografins födelse på 1800-talet var en avgörande händelse i de visuella konsternas historia - en medieteknologisk omvälvning som förändrade förutsättningarna också för litterärt skapande. Litteraturens och fotografins fortsatta samverkan kom att sätta djupa spår i fältet för konstnärlig produktion under 1900- och 2000-talen. Några av dess uttryck och effekter diskuteras i 'Att skriva med ljus?, där svenska, danska och norska författare rör sig från fotografen Nadars memoarer till filmskaparen Wim Wenders fototexter med nedslag hos bland andra Gertrude Stein, André Breton, Ivar Lo-Johansson, Asger Jorn och Elias Canetti   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For their part, some artists have privileged the photography-writing relationship by exploiting that link in different ways. Both means coexist by generating particular forms of creation: they cross their own borders and give rise to a new space of creation and significance. This international colloquium, organized by RETINA.

The connection with Ireland was nourished by the solitude of the Irish peatlands, the beauty of the wild coasts and the Irish themselves - who are generally praised for their kindness. Many Irish in the countryside are still cutting turf and use it as fuel. During one of her walks, she met a family loading sods of turf on a trailer. She asked if she could take a picture and they willingly stopped to pose. This photo turned out to be the birth of her photo project. In 2019, Bo went back for a year, to photograph the process of peat extraction. 'Peat' tells the story of the importance and the beauty of Irish peatlands and the transience of ancient Irish peat cutting traditions   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wer ab den späten 1960er Jahren vor Cora Pongracz' Kamera stand, gehört in vielen Fällen heute noch zum Who is Who der künstlerischen und literarischen Avantgarde. Cora Pongracz ist aber nicht nur Dokumentaristin, ihre Portraits zeugen von künstlerischer Reflexion und der Suche nach einer neuen Position als Fotografin. Ab Mitte der 1970er Jahre arbeitete sie an konzeptuellen Serien. Um die Vielschichtigkeit einer Persönlichkeit zu vermitteln, machte sie nicht nur Einzelportraits, sondern übersetzte das Umfeld des Portraitierten in assoziative Fotoserien. Hier reiht sich Pongracz in den damals aktuellen Diskurs über Identität, Pose und Performativität ein ? Aspekte, die den zeitgenössischen Kunstdiskurs bis heute prägen.

Since 2006, he has worked almost exclusively with Milk Studios on photography and film projects. With the advantage of a base of operations at the Milk Studios in New York City and Los Angeles, Comte has found the freedom to work outside of and transcend the limitations of the traditional ""fashion photographer"" role, working in fashion, portraiture, reportage and now motion pictures. ""Whether Michel has a Hollywood celebrity or an orphan from the Third World in front of his lens,"" said Tina Brown, former editor-in-chief of the New Yorker, ""he takes both their pictures with the same sincerity and devotion."" Published on the occasion of the 20-year anniversary of Milk Studios, this deluxe clothbound volume was designed by creative director Mike Meiré, whose own 25-year career working at the nexus of culture and design is the stuff of legend.

The scope of his accomplishments as a photojournalist is nothing short of remarkable: he has photographed every U.S. president since Eisenhower, as well as Robert F. Kennedy on the night he was assassinated, and Martin Luther King Jr. at his funeral; he has shot stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Mick Jagger, Dolly Parton, Michael Jackson, Greta Garbo, and Truman Capote; he covered both the rise and fall of the Berlin wall, the IRA hunger strikes, the Freedom March through Mississippi, the Watts riots, 9/11, and conflicts in Kuwait, Bosnia, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Israel; and, on the eve of his 80th birthday, Benson is still at it, crisscrossing the globe on assignment for Conde Nast. The Harry Benson Book is a visual celebration of Benson's incomparable career. Organized into chapters on celebrity, art, fashion, sports, politics, and photojournalism, The Harry Benson Book features a distinctive mix of iconic images alongside never-before-published photographs of Sir Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Billy Graham, Bobby Fischer, Muhammad Ali, the Beatles, Sonny Liston, Chuck Berry, O.J. Simpson, Yogi Berra, Sophia Loren, Kate Moss, Gloria Swanson, James Brown, Fred Astaire, Johnny Carson, Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Clint Eastwood, Woody Allen, Spike Lee, Alfred Hitchcock, Federico Fellini, Joseph Papp, Andy Warhol, Liza Minelli, Barbra Streisand, Halston, Giorgio Armani, Valentino, Diana Vreeland, and countless others. With unique access to the most elusive, alluring, and enduring legends of our time, Benson's magnum opus is an unsurpassed masterpiece of contemporary photojournalism and portraiture.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this book, author Larry Gates (of Aberdeen, South Dakota) ""dives in"" to the topic of underwater photography and teaches the skills beginning photographers need to explore saltwater and freshwater environments. Beginning with a look at the equipment used, Gates explains how to keep your camera water-tight, choose lenses and accessories, and assemble your system. You'll learn which lenses are best for photographing large versus small creatures, reef scenes, wrecks, divers, and more. You'll also learn how to work with a strobe, ensure sharp focus, and increase the odds of getting images with vibrant color. Finally, Gates provides strategies for managing your workflow and doing basic image editing after the dive.""--Amazon.com.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jean-Yves Camus's photographic essay relates a story of the earth. It visually and freely recounts events from the past, events that are prehistoric (literally, before the time of stories and the language of things) and antediluvian (again literally, before the great rains of the flood from other stories). It is a story of soil, flora and climate. In this sense it is an elementary story, an initial and primordial story (if not of origins, at least well before death) related to the elements: air, water, fire and earth, like four elements of vocabulary from the lexicon of this visual discourse.

Sarah Moon: Now and Then,Sarah Moon,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL15451440W,/authors/OL189586A/Sarah_Moon,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28838013M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Kehrer Verlag Heidelberg, Klaus Kehrer|Language English|Pages 160","The photographer known by her artist's name Sarah Moon (b. 1941) grew up in England and France. Having worked as a model in Paris for some years, she began taking photographs in 1968. Her first campaign shots for Cacharel were followed by countless commercial works for Dior, Chanel, Comme des Garcons, and Christian Lacroix. Additionally, Moon photographed fashion editorials for magazines, and shot short movies and documentaries as well as the feature film Mississippi One. She was the first woman to ever shoot for the renowned Pirelli calendar. Recent works include photographs and a short film for Dior homme.  Looking at Moon's frequently blurred black-and-whites or her pale color photographs—often taken on Polaroid film—one is beckoned into a realm of dreams, myths, and fears. Simultaneously, her works allude to heavenly ideals, unknown landscapes, and enchanted cities. Her portraits of girls and women, especially in her fashion images, appear to grant a glimpse into timelessness.  Sarah Moon's works have been exhibited in museums and galleries around the globe, including at the Center of Photography, New York, the Maison Européene de la Photographie, Paris, the Kyoto Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Royal College of Art, London.  The book was published on the occasion of the most comprehensive retrospective exhibition in the House of Photography of the Deichtorhallen Hamburg, Germany. It has an embossed cardboard cover with linen spine, a separate image leaf is shrinkwrapped onto the cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Albania, a photographic journey",Loïc Chauvin - Christian Raby,photography,First published in 2011,/works/OL15690987W,/authors/OL6891815A/Loïc_Chauvin_-_Christian_Raby,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Ecrits de lumière,"This is the first retrospective of the Albanian history of photography which represents a dozen photographers. The hundreds of photographs selected for this book is the result of research that has been conducted over the course of many years. This research has unearthed several thousand photographs from different photographic Albanian archives, both known and unknown.  Albania remains largely unrepresented in the global history of photography. This country possesses a photographic legacy, which, though unique among the Balkans, has gone unnoticed, both inside and outside its borders. Most images presented in this book have never before been the subject of exhibition or publication.  The history of Albanian photography began with an Italian, Pietro Marubi, a Garibaldian who, fleeing repression, found refuge in Albania. He settled in Shkodra and after taking his first photograph in 1858, opened the first photographic studio in Albania. Three generations then followed.  Beggars, artisans, intellectuals, politicians, and even the court of King Zog...the entire Albanian society was striking a tireless pose tirelessly in front of the camera lens. Over the course of almost a century, the Marubi have accumulated over 120 000 negatives. In 1995, Loic Chauvin dedicated his first book, published by Arthaud, to this dynasty of photographers.  But Albanian photography cannot be resumed by only one family of photographers. Dozens of other artists have been working in Albania from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century. The photographic collections show the political, cultural, social and religious Albania at the turn of the period; from the end of the Ottoman Empire to the hard-won independence.  It may be noted specifically that, in a country where three confessions coexist, funeral pictures became a true rite of photography.  This book aims to explore this photographic richness that has been ignored to date and provide a different image of Albania than what has been conveyed by the usual clichés.

The study is based on a hope of finding form and structure or at least acceptance of the transience of everything. At the same time, the image worlds challenge photography in its traditional form, as the subject is often subject and object at the same time. Emma Krantz has consistently through her art been objects in her visual worlds while she assumes the role of director in the space in front of the camera lens  Boken är en pågående undersökning av tillvaron. Metodiskt vrider och vänder fotografen på den genom skapandet av olika bildvärldar. Undersökningen bottnar i en förhoppning om att hitta form och struktur eller åtminstone acceptans inför allts förgänglighet. Bildvärldarna utmanar samtidigt fotografiet i dess traditionella form då motivet ofta är subjekt och objekt samtidigt.

Dabei verknüpft sich die allgemeine Wahrnehmung eines Landes eng mit den Persönlichkeiten seiner politischen Wu·rdentra·ger:innen. So berichten die Medien gerne mithilfe ikonenhafter Motive: groß und pompös, manchmal auch gewalttätig und brutal ? je nach aktueller gesellschaftspolitischer Situation. Hinzu mischt sich das kollektive Gedächtnis aus geschichtlichen Geschehnissen, durchsetzt mit individuellen subjektiven Assoziationen.0Fernab dieser staatstragenden Bildgewalt findet die tatsächliche, von der Bevölkerung oft unbeachtete Arbeit in den oft wenig repräsentativen Amtsstuben der Beamt:innen und Staatsangestellt:innen statt: ein in seiner Gesamtheit kaum greifbarer Apparat.0Mit seinem Buch richtet der Fotograf Lukas Ratius den Fokus auf die Bandbreite und Kleinteiligkeit der administrativen und politischen Institutionen des Bundeslandes Saarland. Daraus entstanden ist eine fragmentarische Darstellung staatlicher Abläufe, mit der Ratius lustvoll und gekonnt die Erwartungshaltungen seiner Betrachter:innen unterwandert.

It is about love and despair in a place where life, at times, can be very uncertain.0The book is a personal depiction of a claustrophobic environment with the cityscape as framework, captured in the cities of Saint Petersburg and Moscow over the last ten years. Through ninety-five photographs in contrast monochromes and dusty colours the book unfolds the night as a motif. Here we meet bulldogs, street fights and abandoned roads alongside loving glances, intimate moments and faded buildings, all quietly standing still, waiting for the night to die down and the light to rise again. Through disquieting atmospheres and raw sensitivity Unsettled City shows us how the people of the night alternately love and fear both the city and each other. With this book M.H.

Those feelings together created a very specific way of looking at his surroundings. He started finding images that represented familiarity in this unfamiliar place. 'I examined my own identity and in this study I began to mirror myself and my origin in the city and the people I met. Suddenly, a parked car became an iceberg, a stranger to a close relation and a shop window to my uncle's living room. I found pictures that represented me and my culture in these unknown places. In my need for nature, I found a different nature, a nature of the city with its own laws, paths, landscapes and people' -Inuuteq Storch.

They do not require any text. Adding words to images is tricky, as words tend to evoke different images or even examples as justification and, consequently, explain the image in question based on a different framework. It is probably no coincidence that these photographs do not have titles, a code at most, enjoy the protection of a wide white framework and uniform colour treatment and have the rhythm of a series that comprises a project.These projects do, however, have titles. They have the ambition to totalise something, not externally, not an encyclopaedic or scientific series or quasi-infinitive total of a collection, but a totality determined by the photograph and the process of photography itself. The cultural landscape, the built-up environment with all of its demarcations and flight lines, forms the perfect subject matter.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ltd.|Language English,"Tadaima' by Annemarieke van Drimmelen (b. 1978, Dutch) is an intimate portrait in respect to the heartache and its beauty of a journey homeward. At age ten Annemarieke acquired a camera for the first time, her mother's, merely after her passing. By picking up the camera she was adept to perceive her mother slightly better by photographing small moments; her father's hands, light reflecting on the water- it was her way of keeping a diary. In recent years she felt it essential to revisit this approach of spirit, by capturing moments during travels through Arizona, California, Paris and Amsterdam. The memory of her mother is piercing in the pictures but also cacti with wooden supports so they won't fall, of walls, and stones, some from Georgia O'Keefe's collection, a towel on a beach, a friend's old chair, women, men, seen as close-up as photographically possible. A narrative of recognisable familial warmth intertwining with herself becoming a mother for the first time. Blue was her mother's favourite color. A very dark blue. By hand printing cyanotypes (or blue prints; a technique invented in 1800's, by Anna Atkins, a British botanist also considered the first woman photographer) for Tadaima, Annemarieke endeavoured to attain as close to her mother?s blue as she can remember. 'Tadaima' is loosely translated from Japanese as 'I just came home'. The book contains a preface by Annemarieke van Drimmelen, written expressly to her late mother.

Stijn van der Linden's photobook is an exploration of how spaces become spaces and how photography can influence this process. It is an artistic experiment that examines concave city corners and tries to systemize corners using certain codes and diagrams related to their physical appearances. Do corners create their own places by connecting certain colours, materials and objects? or is it all a matter of people's perception? 'an essay on the concave city corner' is a poetic and faux-scientific look on hidden and vague locations in the city.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Different historical time periods and materials meet in Søndergaard's photographs. By combining images of contemporary women wearing historical dresses and head covers, girls in modern garments wearing 18th century gold embroidered bonnets, and evocative interiors of uninhabited Danish manor houses, Søndergaard creates a universe, which is neither past nor present, fact nor fiction.0This second edition features a new cover, a modified layout and three new pictures in addition to all of the photos from the first edition of the book which was awarded 'The Most Beautiful German Book' (Die schönsten deutschen Bücher) by Stiftung Buchkunst with the words: The paper, print quality and the impeccable bookbinding transmit the contemplative mood of the images, which captures the viewer and then leaves you alone. Condensed time. Timelessness. A magical book. The new edition also contains the extensive essay from the first edition by the internationally renowned cultural theorist Mieke Bal, who deals extensively with Trine Søndergaard's work.

A moment in a life story, or the essence of a life? A portrait of the sitter, or a portrait of the photographer? Unmistakable truth, or staged imposture? And when the portrait in full face is accompanied by a portrait in profile, the subject we see in the picture is perhaps more properly an object? A suspect object of public control, or an interesting object of scientific research? Often, portraits appear in series. Are these still photographs of individuals, or are they meant to visualize typical features? Features of a period, a social group, an exotic culture, perhaps a race? Are such series descriptive or normative? Does the photographic medium contribute to the canonization of certain groups, and stigmatization of others? The photographic portrait conveys presence as well as absence. The photographic portrait compels us to ask whether we are still here in our bodies, or perhaps rather there in our pictures. Whatever the answer, the split between me and my picture prompts a reflexivity which is distinctive of Modernity, and that Modernity largely owes to photography. In the present anthology, taking their starting points in various examples of Norwegian photographic portraiture, a number of scholars discuss the position of photographic portraits between fact and fiction: Trond Bjorli, Marthe T.

It perches on the top tip of Africa, its soul in the Maghreb, its eyes set on Europe, for centuries a cultural crossroads. Four photographers encounter differing facets of an ever-moving city, capturing moments in the medina, the seaside forests, in stark new suburbs. They tell the story of a city steeped in the past, tossed by change, and reaching uncertainly for the future, but most of all of a city that somehow, in a way you can never quite define, gets a hold of you   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Det har han gjort i hele sin karriere, hvor han blandt andre har haft en lang række skuespillere, musikere, kunstnere, politikere, sportsfolk og andre kendte foran sit kamera. Men i hans hænder bliver fotografier af mennesker til langt mere end blot registreringer af smilende personer - de bliver til fortællinger. Hans tilgang er, at billedet skal ville modtageren noget. Vi skal ganske enkelt kunne mærke, at den fotograferede er til stede. Det er det, han stræber efter og har haft succes med i sin snart 40 år lange karriere, og hvis det bliver lidt skørt og har et strejf af humor, gør det absolut ikke noget. Det nærvær gør i sig selv billederne til små kunstværker, der kalder på modtagerens opmærksomhed og fortæller en historie. I bogen 'Fjæs', der er efterfølgeren til 'Surface' fra 2007, har han samlet en række af pletskuddene fra de seneste 15 år. Bogen er på 200 sider og har forord af Kristian Ditlev Jensen.

Whatever they depict, is how he found them. He always defines the framing at the time of recording the image, nothing is cropped when he prints the pictures. He also does not worry himself with dating and naming the subject. His photos just have to speak for themselves. The examples depicted in this book, made during the second half of his life, also do this. His photographic eye is unmistakably similar to that of photographers like Moholy-Nagy, Kertesz and Wols in the nineteen twenties and thirties. His viewpoint, however, is distinguished by a unique ambience and sensitivity. The darkness is striking in many of his pieces, equally as striking as the absence of people. Once in a while they do appear in the images, but they then merge into the other objects and are often no more than shadows. Baumgärtner's photos are enigmatic. Where do the stairs begin in the darkness, what could that bright light be in a shed, what is going on behind that strikingly large window? There is always particular attention for what seems to be scattered over a surface. Whoever is familiar with Klaus Baumgärtner's whole oeuvre will come across phenomena in his photos that are reminiscent of his quirky untitled plastic objects.

Upon returning to Australia, Hutchinson set about reinterpreting and expanding the scope of resulting photographs in a bid to respond to the impact of climate change on the Arctic region and address our responsibilities not just as Australians, but as global citizens.

In de vroege jaren '80 schikte Evers objecten tot kleine stillevens en maakte hij installaties. Hij experimenteerde daarbij net zolang met vormen, texturen en schaduwen tot een sterke compositie ontstond, die hij met zijn technische camera registreerde en na de sessie vernietigde. Nadat Evers - van meet af aan veeleer scheppend kunstenaar dan volbloed fotograaf - in 1992 digitaal ging werken, deed zich ook inhoudelijk een verschuiving voor: van spannende objets trouvés naar eigenzinnige stadsbeelden en collages met een soms nadrukkelijk symbolische lading. Het werk van Winfred Evers kreeg een plaats in prominente tijdschriften en is opgenomen in belangrijke collecties in binnen- en buitenland.

He was fascinated with an image that appeared each month in a science magazine depicting an extreme close up of an everyday object. The form the abstraction took, and that it was an everyday object most people did not recognize, rather than what is was, interested him.0At boarding school, he found an old enlarger in a cellar in the art building, he dusted it down and got it working. Even at that time, he liked taking abstract images, but was misadvised that the strength of photography was in depicting reality and if he wanted to focus on the abstract, he should look at other media such as painting and drawing. After years concentrating on his university studies, work and raising a family his interest in photography never waned, and within the last couple of years Grant began devoting much of his time to his passion in photography.

Her photos breathe the atmosphere of the works of the old Dutch masters through similar her themes and lighting. Although beauty is the starting point for Jenny's work, her photographs are more than just aesthetic. The longer you look, the more layers unfold before your eyes. Her work is modern and draws attention to current issues. Jenny made a contemporary translation of the iconic painting 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' by Vermeer, photographing a black model in the same setting. The reason for this work was her realisation that it?s hard to find any black models in museums. She also made a series of portraits of women with old-fashioned millstone collars. If we look more closely, however, we suddenly see that the collars are not made of fabric, but of money notes, cigarettes and sanitary towels, for example. 00In the photo book 'On Beauty' we are invited and challenged to look at the world through the eyes of Jenny Boot. The book is a beautiful summary of the photographer's work over the years.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Walking together resonates with the phenomenological minutiae of street life and for the entire duration of the Walk Piece, participants refrain from verbal exchange and picture taking. Participating in a Walk Piece and/or your personal experience of reading this book are the only valid materializations of David Bergé's ephemeral works. 'A Walk in High Resolution' deals with corporeality, sleeping, awakening, and walking through the interiors and fissures of urban infrastructures. Almost touching neighboring bodies, reliving experiences in cities by being absorbed in space that is at once personal, reflective, consumptive, and the other, we walk through cities.

The Finnish photographic artist Lauri Eriksson uses this medium to capture images of woodlands in and around Helsinki. During the pandemic, the natural scenery found right next door ? in vanishing islands of plant life squeezed between housing blocks and urban sprawl ? filled the artist with a powerful nostalgia and sense of the sublime that resides in every fragment of nature. The Polaroid was declared dead long ago, but its power of expressivity remains undiminished. It has proved itself a highly versatile medium of contemporary art with an evocative power to invoke the fleeting nature of life today. In the pixel-perfect digital age, the blurry imprecision and analogue softness of Polaroids add a poignant human voice to the dialogue between the past and the future.00Lauri Eriksson has held solo exhibitions both in Finland and abroad. He has been experimenting with Polaroids since the 1990s. This marks his fourth book of photography, featuring a pick of his finest works from the past few years.

Drawing on a series of darkroom contact prints titled Spatial misalignments which were conceived by shining light through the pages of three long-out-of-print editions of The Reader's Digest Great World Atlas. Sydney-based photographer and artist Izabela Pluta's debut book bears witness to the turbulence, mutability and power structures that both prop up and undermine the static dogmas of the global map. In these richly and elusively detailed images, the world as we knew it blurs and collapses in on itself, flow and miasma gently erasing the borders and demarcations? the strategic fictions and mythologies to which we've anchored our semantics of place. Underscored by a collaborative text work by Melbourne poet Lisa Gorton and an experimental essay by Art Gallery of NSW Senior Curator of Contemporary Australian Art Isobel Parker Philip, Figures of slippage and oscillation reappraises our philosophical and conceptual grappling with geography and cartography. Here, the fog of arbitrariness bankrupts the law and lore of our oceans and lands; the echo of violence, migration and climatic shift belies our borders. In the process, Pluta whispers to the fragility of our geological, environmental and societal condition. As the oceans wash through our now quaint delineations, she archives our loss.

Shot at one of the city's detention centres between 1991 and 1993, the archive contained over 15,000 black-and-white negatives of confiscated objects, contraband, and evidence. Without any further information or context, we are left to wonder about their unidentified owners and the events to which they bear witness. Reproduced here in their original form as negatives, every item is preserved like an artefact, a fossil for our examination. The utilitarian function of the negatives thus allows compassion to arise from memory.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After 25 years of roaming the world, camera on shoulder, he gathered a photographic archive that reflects his regret feelings of staying emotionally distant from his family and his social and cultural roots. ""Itaka Archive by Gonzalo Olmos is the product of the meticulous selection of photographic images that narrate a personal life story, continuously accompanied by feelings of rootedness, rootlessness, nostalgia and liminality. The latter understood as that state of ambiguity, in time and space, of transformation, of not really belonging anywhere, but of rather being on a threshold."". The book includes essays by Peruvian curator Carlo Trivelli, anthropologist Valeria Biffi and Gonzalo Olmos himself. It is an evocative visual journey into the past, a process of exploration very introspective in the construction of the identity and subjectivity of the photographer.

Inventions are good, but if the point of escape into the unknown is the known, even better. Certainly nothing is more readily available than one?s own family. It is a matrix we will never leave, and if we escape it, we inevitably escape in relation to it. Diana worked with the image material her family generated on many formal and technical layers, visually formulating such larger questions as: who sees whom in which way, and smaller questions, such as: What is one doing when the camera is turned off? To what extent is a skin really our last boundary, and what happens when one dies? Diana exploits every possible representation of (her) family, and transforms it with a sharp eye into an art that is entirely its own. She uses the whole repertoire of the contemporary photo-filmic infrastructure, from the mobile phone to the memory stick of her father?s product palette from the last 10 years, to the dashcam of her truck-driving mother, to email, also in order to fulfill yet subvert every possible cliché about the East one could imagine. We should not forget the proper art historical knowledge sleeping behind her approach, which she luckily applies in a very liberating, un-academic and free manner. You wouldn?t need a reference with the simple function of affirming the position of her work, as it is with a lot of art these days. In the end, Diana uses something as personal as family to say something public, close to a narration on something as large as the European transformations that took place during the last 30 years.

Photographers Tom Griggs and Paul Kwiatkowski barely knew each other when they began the project. Their conversations about photography and their personal experiences during the years covered in the book set them off on a collaborative work that represents the intersection of their life narratives. ""On November 13, 2009, Andrew Lindberg, a young pilot, departed from the Twin Cities to meet his father for a hunting trip in northern Minnesota. He never arrived; a few days later, Lindberg's plane was located deep within the wilderness of the White Earth Indian Reservation. In Ghost Guessed Tom Griggs and Paul Kwiatkowski examine how absences caused by death make memories, no matter how abstract, more salient and complex. A combination of intimate prose and photographs brings into focus our human connections as filtered through technology and visual media. From Lindberg's accident to the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Ghost Guessed reflects on how we process loss as it plays out in the ongoing digitalization of our lives""--Verso cover.  The book is the outcome of a joint venture: three publishers, a photographer and 46 Medellin authors that expressed their thoughts about this Colombian city. We started from photographs by Tom Griggs, an American Tom Griggs, a photographer, editor, educator and writer based in Medellín, Colombia almost a decade ago. From his vast archive we chose a sample of 100 images. Those included in the book were selected by the people summoned to write. The challenge for them was to speak from photography; literary genre was everyone's decision. This is the result: a polyphonic book where unequivocal gaze or explanation is losing place. It is the different points of view that can approach what is going on.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His production goes from classic photography to the manipulation of archives of images, and he presents them in various media: Installations, video, and many ways of reproduction and optical capture, contemporary and obsolete. The image in movement and the subject in movement is the synthesis of a conceptual exercise throughout his work: there is not chronological order, but the order of the various intellectual explorations, around the domestication of the body, the social taxonomies, the secret languages, the iconography of gestures and the uses of technique amongst his multiple searches.

Mais dans Red Harvest, les corps brûlés par le soleil, les eaux trop lumineuses, les cieux embrasés et les ombres brisées produisent autre chose. Plutôt que de proposer une fausse réalité dans laquelle nous pourrions nous perdre, ces éléments nous extraient de la vie telle qu’elle est vécue, ou tout du moins comme nous la vivons habituellement en surface, pour nous entraîner profondément dans une vérité alternative hyper-présente et super-saturée. Les couleurs ne sont ici jamais purement ou simplement symboliques, elles ne signifient rien de spécifique ou de précisément défini. Au contraire, la couleur elle-même signifie, par sa présence et son apparence, sa variété et son intensité, son organisation et sa disposition, que nous sommes ici dans un monde original, et que nous le voyons différemment. »  Simon Baker   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Unnaturally vivid hues and multi-textured surfaces are presented in bold and not infrequently witty juxtapositions. Bornhauser often moves in close to her subjects, which speaks both of her innate curiosity and the surprising intimacy of everyday encounters on the street. Ending with the words ""L'apparence d'un décor, monde halluciné"", Plastic Colors indeed takes us on a journey through a world in which scenery, everyday objects and simulacra connect.  Plastic Colors was short-listed for the First book Award (Mack Books) in 2015 and has since been exhibited widely.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Illustrated. Updated with new research.Stephen Hawking's worldwide bestseller, A Brief History of Time, has been a landmark volume in scientific writing. Its author's engaging voice is one reason, and the compelling subjects he addresses is another: the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, the history and future of the universe. But it is also true that in the years since its publication, readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book's most important concepts.This is the origin of and the reason for A Briefer History of Time: its author's wish to make its content accessible to readers — as well as to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings.Although this book is literally somewhat 'briefer', it actually expands on the great subjects of the original. Purely technical concepts, such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, are gone. Conversely, subjects of wide interest that were difficult to follow because they were interspersed throughout the book have now been given entire chapters of their own, including relativity, curved space, and quantum theory.This reorganization has allowed the authors to expand areas of special interest and recent progress, from the latest developments in string theory to exciting developments in the search for a complete, unified theory of all the forces of physics. Like prior editions of the book—but even more so — A Briefer History of Time will guide nonscientists everywhere in the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space.Thirty-eight full-colour illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating addition in its own right to the literature of science.

In 1964, at Cornell University, he delivered the famous Messenger Lectures. This book, The Character of Physical Law, sprung from these lectures. In this classic work, Feynman explores the relationship between math and physics, describes the great conservation principles, the puzzle of symmetry in physical law, how to reconcile physical problems that yield infinite results with their manifestations in the natural world, and quantum mechanical views of nature. Feynman's accessible speech and conversational style comes through well in each essay; his simple pencil and paper drawings communicate complex ideas as if one were viewing them on a chalk board. This reissue features a foreword by Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek, which situates the work within modern scholarship and describes why the book is still relevant today. Although he mentions areas where Feynman's theories need ""updating,"" he points out that Feynman's unorthodox and brilliant way of thinking helped develop the general quantum electrodynamics theory, one of the most precise and accurate theories in physical science. Wilczek concludes with the assertion that this book represents Feynman at ""the height of his powers, and that this ""is the single best introduction to modern physics, altogether.""""--   Read more Read less",29 Want to read|0 Currently reading|6 Have read

Therefore, besides giving students a thorough grounding in the theory of waves and vibrations, the book also demonstrates the pattern and unity of a large part of physics.  This new edition has been thoroughly revised and has been redeisgned to meet the best contemporary standards. It includes new material on electron waves in solids using the Kronig-Penney model to show how their allowed energies are limited to Brillouin zones, The role of phonons is also discussed. An Optical Transform is used to demonstrate the modern method of lens testing. In the last two chapters the sections on chaos and solitons have been reduced but their essential contents remain.  As with earlier editions, the book has a large number of problems together with hints on how to solve them. The Physics of Vibrations and Waves, 6th Edition will prove invaluable for students taking a first full course in the subject across a variety of disciplines particularly physics, engineering and mathematics.

In A Leg to Stand On, it is Sacks himself who is the patient: an encounter with a bull on a desolate mountain in Norway has left him with a severely damaged leg. But what should be a routine recuperation is actually the beginning of a strange medical journey when he finds that his leg uncannily no longer feels part of his body. Sacks's brilliant description of his crisis and eventual recovery is not only an illuminating examination of the experience of patienthood and the inner nature of illness and health but also a fascinating exploration of the physical basis of identity.

Known for her kind, gentle nature, she lives with Micah Smith, a widower, and his two young daughters. When the FBI takes her into custody on charges of flight to avoid prosecution, purportedly for a murder that took place in California, the local reaction is stunned disbelief. Yet, when those closest to her, including Micah, think back over the time they have known her, they realize that they have learned virtually nothing about her earlier life. Poppy Blake is Heather's closest friend. A lifelong resident of Lake Henry, Poppy is confined to a wheelchair, the result of a snowmobile accident nearly a dozen years prior that left her a paraplegic and killed her male companion. Since then, she has worked hard to rebuild her life. Currently, she runs a local telephone messaging service out of her specially equipped house on Lake Henry. Fiercely independent, Poppy refuses to let her physical limitations break her spirit. However, it is her guilt over past mistakes, more than her present disability, which is holding her back from pursuing a future that includes a husband and family. Writer Griffin Hughes originally traveled to Lake Henry to investigate a national news story involving Lily Blake, Poppy's older sister. What keeps him coming back is his attraction to Poppy. However, a chance comment made tohis brother, an FBI agent, provides the thread that leads the law to Heather. To redeem himself, Griffin is compelled to solve the mystery of Heather's past. Along the way, he becomes key to freeing Poppy from her own past and helping her see the possibilities of a richer future. Setting her story against the backdrop of a picturesque New England town during the maple syrup harvesting season, when the harshness of winter yields to the sweet promise of spring, and when the whole town is involved in the race to process the sap before the thaw sets in, Barbara Delinsky has written a tightly knit and compelling story that celebrates the values of community, friendship, and the redemptive power of love.

But not everyone knows that what we can see makes up only 5 percent of the Universe. The rest is totally invisible to us. The invisible stuff comes in two varieties — dark matter and dark energy. One holds the Universe together while the other tears it apart. What these forces really are has been a mystery for as long as anyone has suspected they were there, but the latest discoveries of experimental physics have brought us closer to that knowledge. Particle physicist Dan Hooper takes his readers, with wit, grace, and a keen knack for explaining the toughest ideas science has to offer, on a quest few would ever have expected: to discover what makes up our dark cosmos.

It is the problem of merging quantum mechanics and general relativity, the two great conceptual revolutions in the physics of the twentieth century. The loop and spinfoam approach, presented in this book, is one of the leading research programs in the field. The first part of the book discusses the reformulation of the basis of classical and quantum Hamiltonian physics required by general relativity. The second part covers the basic technical research directions. Appendices include a detailed history of the subject of quantum gravity, hard-to-find mathematical material, and a discussion of some philosophical issues raised by the subject. This fascinating text is ideal for graduate students entering the field, as well as researchers already working in quantum gravity. It will also appeal to philosophers and other scholars interested in the nature of space and time.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

But what if, nonetheless, Einstein got it wrong?Since the 1930s, physicists have noticed an alarming discrepancy between the universe as we see it and the universe that Einstein's theory of relativity predicts. There just doesn't seem to be enough stuff out there for everything to hang together. Galaxies spin so fast that, based on the amount of visible matter in them, they ought to be flung to pieces, the same way a spinning yo-yo can break its string. Cosmologists tried to solve the problem by positing dark matter...ysterious, invisible substance that surrounds galaxies, holding the visible matter in place — and particle physicists, attempting to identify the nature of the stuff, have undertaken a slew of experiments to detect it. So far, none have.Now, John W. Moffat, a physicist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, offers a different solution to the problem. The capstone to a storybook career — one that began with a correspondence with Einstein and a conversation with Niels Bohr — Moffat's modified gravity theory, or MOG, can model the movements of the universe without recourse to dark matter, and his work challenging the constancy of the speed of light raises a stark challenge to the usual models of the first half-million years of the universe's existence.This bold new work, presenting the entirety of Moffat's hypothesis to a general readership for the first time, promises to overturn everything we thought we knew about the origins and evolution of the universe.

Yet as recently as the early twentieth century, the general public and even astronomers had vague and confused notions about what lay beyond the visible stars.  Minding the Heavens: The Story of Our Discovery of the Milky Way is about how scientists discovered that we lived in a galaxy, in fact, a universe full of galaxies. This fascinating story of the discovery of our own and other galaxies is told through the lives of seven astronomers: Thomas Wright, William Herschel, Wilhelm Struve, William Huggins, Jacobus Kapteyn, Harlow Shapley, and Edwin Hubble. Each contributed greatly to our present understanding of where we live in the cosmos. Through the science and lives of these seven people, each shaped by their family, friends, and contemporaries, we follow this amazing story of discovery. From the mid 1700s with Thomas Wright through to the mid 20th century with the more familiar names of Shapley and Hubble, each character bringing us nearer to our present understanding of the Universe.

Thinking Physics is a perfect beginner's guide to an amazingly wide range of physics-related questions. The book targets topics that science teachers and students spend time wondering about, like wing lift. Epstein elucidates the familiar but misunderstood — such as how tides work — along with more obscure but fascinating phenomena like the ""Bernoulli sub"" and the ""artificial aurora"" created by hydrogen bombs. Broken into many short sections and peppered with Epstein's own playful hand-drawn illustrations, the book does not simply give the right answer: It also goes into the answers that seem right but are wrong and shows why they are wrong — a rarity in science books. Thinking Physics is a rigorously correct, lighthearted, and cleverly designed Q and A book for physicists of all ages.   Read more Read less",82 Want to read|6 Currently reading|4 Have read

The author investigates the most important classes of phenomena that characterize a direction of time: radiation, thermodynamics, quantum phenomena, and the structure of spacetime. Their relations and the search for a cosmological common root of these ""arrows of time"" and of the traditional concept of causality are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on quantum indeterminism. It is argued that a common root may be found in the properties of the time-independent wave function of the universe that arises from the quantization of general relativity. This requires that the physical concept of time is reduced to a correlation between physical states, including those characterizing clocks and observers. The description of irreversible phenomena is shown to be fundamentally ""observer-related"" in a way that can be formalized following Zwanzig. The book is aimed mainly at the student or scientist seeking an overview of the whole issue. Compared to the German version the book has been widely revised and extended.

This book is a comprehensive introduction to these recent developments. It contains a review of the Standard Model, covering non-perturbative topics, and a discussion of grand unified theories and magnetic monopoles. It introduces the basics of supersymmetry and its phenomenology, and includes dynamics, dynamical supersymmetry breaking, and electric-magnetic duality. The book then covers general relativity and the big bang theory, and the basic issues in inflationary cosmologies before discussing the spectra of known string theories and the features of their interactions. The book also includes brief introductions to technicolor, large extra dimensions, and the Randall-Sundrum theory of warped spaces. This will be of great interest to graduates and researchers in the fields of particle theory, string theory, astrophysics and cosmology.

È questo l’inizio della termodinamica. Ma si era anche all’inizio della Rivoluzione industriale e da allora innovazione tecnologica e innovazione scientifica hanno proceduto in parallelo, specchiandosi l’una nell’altra, e dando vita di fatto al mondo nel quale noi oggi viviamo.    «Termodinamica è un nome terrificante per quella che forse è la teoria scientifica universale più utile che sia mai stata concepita», scrive Paul Sen. Spesso relegata alla descrizione delle macchine a vapore e dei frigoriferi, nelle pagine di questo libro la termodinamica in effetti appare molto più di questo. I tre concetti fondamentali che stanno alla base di questa disciplina, infatti – energia, entropia e temperatura –, rappresentano il nucleo teorico fondante di buona parte delle nostre conoscenze sul mondo fisico.    L’epopea della narrazione di Sen, dopo Sadi Carnot, contempla i nomi dei grandi della scienza degli ultimi due secoli: James Watt, James Joule, lord Kelvin, Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolf Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, Albert Einstein, Emmy Noether, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, Stephen Hawking... un pantheon di giganti che coi loro studi, le loro vite e le loro intuizioni hanno contribuito a cambiare radicalmente la nostra visione del mondo. È grazie a loro che sappiamo che esistono gli atomi, ne conosciamo il comportamento, sappiamo finalmente cos’è il calore (uno dei problemi centrali della scienza) e come si propaga; ma grazie alla termodinamica sappiamo anche cosa sono il tempo, l’informazione, la vita, l’intelligenza e persino i buchi neri dell’universo: ognuna di queste cose senza la termodinamica non avrebbero senso.

First her ex-husband Felix, from whom she has been separated for five years, suddenly moves back in, and then one of her elderly patients dies, leaving a will that is somewhat suspicious. The money bequeathed was non-existent, and the most valuable legacy has vanished. Then three people die violently. Any of the people named in the will might have committed the first murder, but why had two other people died? In the midst of so much that was unexpected, Virginia found it easy to accept that Felix could be unusually astute. She even began to find it easy to accept Felix...

If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible--food shortages, refugee emergencies, climate wars and economic devastation.  An ""epoch-defining book"" (The Guardian) and ""this generation's Silent Spring"" (The Washington Post), The Uninhabitable Earth is both a travelogue of the near future and a meditation on how that future will look to those living through it--the ways that warming promises to transform global politics, the meaning of technology and nature in the modern world, the sustainability of capitalism and the trajectory of human progress.  The Uninhabitable Earth is also an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation--today's.  Praise for The Uninhabitable Earth:  ""The Uninhabitable Earth is the most terrifying book I have ever read. Its subject is climate change, and its method is scientific, but its mode is Old Testament. The book is a meticulously documented, white-knuckled tour through the cascading catastrophes that will soon engulf our warming planet.""--Farhad Manjoo, The New York Times  ""Riveting. . . . Some readers will find Mr. Wallace-Wells's outline of possible futures alarmist. He is indeed alarmed. You should be, too.""--The Economist  ""Potent and evocative. . . . Wallace-Wells has resolved to offer something other than the standard narrative of climate change. . . . He avoids the 'eerily banal language of climatology' in favor of lush, rolling prose.""--Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times  ""The book has potential to be this generation's Silent Spring.""--The Washington Post  ""The Uninhabitable Earth, which has become a best seller, taps into the underlying emotion of the day: fear. . . . I encourage people to read this book.""--Alan Weisman, The New York Review of Books  No.1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER * ""The Uninhabitable Earth hits you like a comet, with an overflow of insanely lyrical prose about our pending Armageddon.""--Andrew Solomon, author of The Noonday Demon  With a new afterword  Source: Publisher   Read more Read less",57 Want to read|2 Currently reading|8 Have read

In the hands of one of today's hottest young physicists, that simple fact of breakfast becomes a doorway to understanding the Big Bang, the universe, and other universes, too. In From Eternity to Here, Sean Carroll argues that the arrow of time, pointing resolutely from the past to the future, owes its existence to conditions before the Big Bang itself-a period modern cosmology of which Einstein never dreamed. Increasingly, though, physicists are going out into realms that make the theory of relativity seem like child's play. Carroll's scenario is not only elegant, it's laid out in the same easy-to- understand language that has made his group blog, Cosmic Variance, the most popular physics blog on the Net.From Eternity to Here uses ideas at the cutting edge of theoretical physics to explore how properties of spacetime before the Big Bang can explain the flow of time we experience in our everyday lives. Carroll suggests that we live in a baby universe, part of a large family of universes in which many of our siblings experience an arrow of time running in the opposite direction. It's an ambitious, fascinating picture of the universe on an ultra-large scale, one that will captivate fans of popular physics blockbusters like Elegant Universe and A Brief History of Time.

It contains a gentle introduction to the subject and therefore can be used even by graduate students. The introductory parts include a derivation of the path integral representation, Feynman diagrams and elements of the theory of metals including a discussion of Landau¬nFermi liquid theory. In later chapters the discussion gradually turns to more advanced methods used in the theory of strongly correlated systems. The book contains a thorough exposition of such non-perturbative techniques as 1/N-expansion, bosonization (Abelian and non-Abelian), conformal field theory and theory of integrable systems. The book is intended for graduate students, postdoctoral associates and independent researchers working in condensed matter physics.

He makes us see the old intuitive, alchemical universe out of which Newton's mathematics first arose and shows us how Newton's ideas have altered all forms of understanding from history to philosophy. And he gives us an account of the conflicting impulses that pulled at this man's heart: his quiet longings, his rage, his secrecy, the extraordinary subtleties of personality that were mirrored in the invisible forces he first identified as the building blocks of science. More than biography, more than history, more than science, Isaac Newton tells us how, through the mind of one man, we have come to know our place in the cosmos.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

The first, which describes the force of gravity, is widely known: Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. But the theory that explains everything else—the Standard Model of Elementary Particles—is virtually unknown among the general public.In The Theory of Almost Everything, Robert Oerter shows how what were once thought to be separate forces of nature were combined into a single theory by some of the most brilliant minds of the twentieth century. Rich with accessible analogies and lucid prose, The Theory of Almost Everything celebrates a heretofore unsung achievement in human knowledge—and reveals the sublime structure that underlies the world as we know it. BACKCOVER: “This highly accessible volume explains the Standard Model to the everyman, using literary references and easy-to-follow analogies to make clear mind-bending physics principles.”—Publishers Weekly“Accessible and engaging…This book is for anyone interested in modern physics and ultimate answers about the universe.”—Science News   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

This edited collection aims to extend the worldwide academic debate of the future of physical education in schools by challenging the prevailing 'authorised curricula'. Each contributor addresses a key contemporary issue in physical education bringing different perspectives as they relate to the evolving issues of the subject. They ask important questions about where we intend to take the knowledge we have gained from a legacy of positive research. These chapters tackle critical issues in modernist physical education and suggest how a re-evaluation could contribute to the continuing advancement of the subject for more diverse educational benefits. Laker draws this body of work together in a conclusion that describes a theoretically and pedagogically innovative physical education curriculum for the 21st century.

It has a strong research tradition, is used frequently as a professional development tool in general education and is now emerging in physical education. This book defines Cooperative Learning in physical education and examines how to implement Cooperative Learning in a variety of educational settings. It explores Cooperative Learning in physical education from three main perspectives. The first, context of learning, provides descriptions of Cooperative Learning in different levels of education (elementary school, secondary school, and university physical education). The second, Cooperative Learning in the curriculum, offers case studies from teachers and researchers of their experiences of implementing Cooperative Learning within their own national context. The third perspective, key aspects of Cooperative Learning, examines how the different elements of the model have been foregrounded in efforts to enhance learning in physical education. As the only text to provide international perspectives, from eight different countries, of Cooperative Learning in physical education, this book is important reading for any student, researcher or teacher with an interest in physical education, sport education, sport pedagogy, curriculum development or methods for learning and teaching""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They are the subject of research in essentially every branch of physics, ranging from condensed matter to cosmology. This book is an introduction to kinks and domain walls and their principal classical and quantum properties. The book examines classical solitons, building from examples in elementary systems to more complicated settings. The formation of solitons in phase transitions, their dynamics, and their cosmological consequences are further discussed. The book closes with an explicit description of a few laboratory systems containing solitons. Kinks and Domain Walls includes several state-of-the-art results, some previously unpublished. Each chapter closes with open questions and research problems. This book will be of great interest to both graduate students and academic researchers in theoretical physics, particle physics, cosmology and condensed matter physics.

But what if the thing you're curious about is too small to see, even with the most powerful microscope? Brian Cathcart's The Fly in the Cathedral tells the intriguing story of how scientists were able to take atoms apart to reveal the secrets of their structures. To keep the story gripping, Cathcart focuses on a time (1932, the annus mirabilis of British physics), a place (Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory), and a few main characters (Ernest Rutherford, the ""father of nuclear physics,"" and his protégés, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton).    Rutherford and his team knew that the long-accepted atomic model was held together by nothing more than trumped-up math and hope. They hoped to find out what held oppositely charged protons and electrons together, and what strange particles shared the nucleus with protons. In a series of remarkable experiments done on homemade apparatus, these Cambridge scientists moved atomic science to within an inch of its ultimate goal. Finally, Cockcroft and Walton--competing furiously with their American and German peers--put together the machine that would forever change history by splitting an atom. The Fly in the Cathedral combines all the right elements for a great science history: historical context, gritty detail, wrenching failure, and of course, glorious victory. Although the miracles that occurred at Cambridge in 1932 were to result in the fearful, looming threat of atomic warfare, Cathcart allows readers to find unfiltered joy in the accomplishments of a few brilliant, ingenious scientists. --Therese Littleton   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|3 Currently reading|0 Have read

The neurologic examination is presented as a flexible diagnostic tool rather than as a rigid exercise to be performed by rote and without reference to the chief complaint. Each chapter integrates evidence-based and experience-based approaches to diagnostic testing and treatment. Frequently-encountered conditions, uncommon 'zebras', and non-neurologic mimics of nervous system dysfunction are all given appropriate weight.

In that way, sport is more powerful than politics. We have only just started to use its potential to build up this country. We must continue to do so."" - Nelson Mandela Nelson Mandela's statement reflects a widely held view that sport can contribute in unique and far-reaching ways to the delivery of important social outcomes. But is this really the case? Can sport bring people from different backgrounds together, and in so doing act as a force for social transformation and change? In the language of policymakers and practitioners, can sport contribute to social inclusion or could it be argued that sport acts to marginalize and disadvantage some groups in society? In other words could sport reinforce, rather than challenge, social inequality? Focusing on youth sport as a touchstone sector of sport in society, this book examines the theoretical and empirical bases of arguments for the role of sport in social inclusion agendas. Authors are drawn from around the world and offer critical perspectives on assumptions underpinning the bold claims made about the power of sport. This book represents the most up-to-date and authoritative source of knowledge on inclusion and exclusion in youth sport.

The development is organized around a progressively more sophisticated analysis of particular natural systems and weaves examples throughout the presentation. Explorations of phenomena such as transitions to chaos, nonlinear resonances, and resonance overlap to help the student to develop appropriate analytic tools for understanding. Computational algorithms communicate methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods of mechanics in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Once formalized as a procedure, a mathematical idea also becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.

Introduction to proteins,Amit Kessel,physics,First published in 2010,/works/OL16132321W,/authors/OL6991223A/Amit_Kessel,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL34632071M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English|Pages 626,"""The book aims to provide the reader with a detailed description of protein structure and dynamics, combined with an in-depth discussion of the relationship between both these aspects and protein function. Adopting the structural-biophysical approach, we discuss these in relation to molecular interactions and thermodynamic changes that transpire in this highly complex system. There are several types of textbooks describing protein structure and function. Biochemistry textbooks emphasize the functional aspect of proteins and provide a rather general description of structure and structure-function relationship (SFR). Structural Biology textbooks provide an extensive description of protein structure and also refer to SFR with varying degrees of detail. However, energy-related aspects are often avoided. Molecular biophysics textbooks focus on molecular interactions and thermodynamic aspects of protein structure, but tend to lack detailed description of structural and dynamic aspects, as well as SFR. Our book refers to all of the aforementioned aspects and attempts to provide a unified view. Our energy-oriented approach is manifested throughout the book, whether we discuss structure, dynamics or specific functions of proteins.

Questioning the universe: concepts in physics,Ahren Sadoff,physics,First published in 2008,/works/OL13614566W?edition=ia%3Aquestioningunive0000sado,/authors/OL6472790A/Ahren_Sadoff,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22543407M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English|Pages 224,"The typical introduction to physics leaves readers with the impression that physics is about 30 different, unconnected topics such as motion, forces, gravity, electricity, light, heat, energy, and atoms. More often than not, these readers are left to conclude that physics is mostly about boring, lifeless numbers.  Questioning the Universe: Concepts in Physics offers the nonscientist an alternative view: one that demonstrates how physics is perpetually evolving and shows how so many seemingly diverse concepts are intimately connected. In fact, one could argue that the most important ideas in modern physics are all about unification, and that these ideas are as fascinating as they are elegant.  Physicists today believe that Mother Nature is remarkably efficient and requires only a relatively small number of laws to keep her universe in working order. We may not yet know all of these laws; but at the center of physics is a faith that she is indeed understandable …and that someday, we will see her full beauty.  The purpose of this book is to tell readers the story of what we have learned about nature so far and how we have done it. Written to arouse curiosity, this compelling and readable work:  * Delves into the most basic laws regarding motion and energy, waves and particles * Introduces modern theories, including relativity, quantum mechanics, and particle physics * Describes the key role played by that elemental building block, the atom * Discusses the evolution of the universe, including the formation of stars and the mystery of dark matter and dark energy This book is not for those doing physics but is aimed at those who simply want to learn about physics, so it requires only the most minimal math. What it does require is a sense of curiosity, an appreciation of beauty, and the capacity for awe.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The first book dedicated to string cosmology, it contains a pedagogical introduction to the basic notions of the subject. It describes the new possible scenarios suggested by string theory for the primordial evolution of our Universe. It discusses the main phenomenological consequences of these scenarios, stresses their differences from each other, and compares them to the more conventional models of inflation. The book summarizes over 15 years of research in this field and introduces current advances. It is self-contained, so it can be read by astrophysicists with no knowledge of string theory, and high-energy physicists with little understanding of cosmology. Detailed and explicit derivations of all the results presented provide a deeper appreciation of the subject.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It covers the quantization of the electromagnetic field, quantum theory of coherence, atom-field interaction models, resonance fluorescence, quantum theory of damping, laser theory using both the master equation and the Langevin approach, the correlated-emission laser, input-output theory with application in nonlinear optics, quantum trajectories, atom optics, quantum non-demolition measurements and generation of non-classsical vibrational states of ions in a Paul trap. These topics are presented in a unified and didactic manner. The presentation of the book is clear and pedagogical; it balances the theoretical aspects of the optical phenomena with recent relevant experiments.

This book is a concise introduction to the structure of the electroweak theory and its applications. It describes the structure and properties of field theories with global and local symmetries, leading to the construction of the standard model. It describes the new particles and processes predicted by the theory, and compares them with experimental results. It also covers neutral currents, the properties of W and Z bosons, the properties of quarks and mesons containing heavy quarks, neutrino oscillations, CP-asymmetries in K, D, and B meson decays, and the search for Higgs particles. Each chapter contains problems, stemming from the long teaching experience of the author, to supplement the text. This will be of great interest to graduate students and researchers in elementary particle physics. Password protected solutions are available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521860987.

Knocking on Heaven's Door is an exhilarating and accessible overview of these developments and a rousing defence of the role of science in our lives. There could be no better guide than Lisa Randall: the bestselling author of Warped Passages is an expert on both particle physics (the study of the smallest objects we know of) and cosmology (the study of the largest) and is one of the most highly regarded theoretical physicists in the world. In Knocking on Heaven's Door she recounts the thrilling progress in our understanding of the universe from Galileo and Newton to Einstein and Feynman; she explores how we decide which scientific questions to study and how we go about answering them; and she examines the role of risk, creativity, uncertainty, beauty and truth in scientific thinking. Throughout, Lisa Randall explains with wit and clarity the latest ideas in physics and cosmology, including the aims of the biggest and most expensive machine ever built: the Large Hadron Collider, the enormous particle accelerator situated over a 100 metres below the French-Swiss border. More than 27 kilometres in circumference, it has within it the hottest spot in the galaxy as well as the coldest and features the most powerful supercomputer system of all time. One of the most illuminating science books in years, Knocking on Heaven's Door makes clear the biggest scientific questions we face and reveals how answering them could ultimately tell us who we are and where we came from.

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences.  Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated.  The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.  Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.

Shomon, here is a holistic roadmap for diagnosis, treatment and recovery for the millions of people suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.  o There are an estimated 3 million-plus Americans suffering from Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism, and patient advocate Mary J. Shomon will guide them through the diagnosis and the wide-ranging treatments available. Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism are the result of the thyroid gland being overactive. This gland controls the body's metabolism, so people afflicted with the disorder can suffer from symptoms such as significant weight loss, fatigue, muscular weakness, and rapid heartbeat, among others. In addition to conventional treatments, this resource uniquely highlights holistic treatments, and through case studies and testimonials from patients and doctors, presents an honest look at the lifestyles and choices of people living with these conditions. Shomon presents the reader with a comprehensive resource that spans from diagnosis to treatment to life after treatment. She goes beyond the conventional advice of other books, utilizing patient anecdotes and, as a fellow thyroid disease patient, her own experience. Her extensive network of experts--from conventional physicians to alternative practitioners--allows for a wide range of treatment options. In addition, a comprehensive Appendix serves as a fantastic resource for patients seeking treatment and additional advice. The first edition of Living Well With Hypothyroidism (2/2000) started with a first printing of 7,500 copies and has now sold over 100,000 in the US. Shomon's The Thyroid Diet hit the New York Times extended bestseller list. Mary Shomon has been praised by doctors around the country for her medical knowledge and sensitivity to patients' needs.Barbara Bush brought attention to the plight of Graves' disease patients, announcing that she was suffering from it when she was First Lady.

The word ""eureka!"", attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, has come to express that universal moment of joy, wonder-and even shock-at discovering something entirely new. In this collection of twelve scientific stories, Leslie Alan Horvitz describes the drama of sudden insight as experienced by a dozen distinct personalities, detailing discoveries both well known and obscure. From Darwin, Einstein, and the team of Watson and Crick to such lesser known luminaries as fractal creator Mandelbrot and periodic table mastermind Dmitri Medellev, Eureka! perfectly illustrates Louis Pasteur's quip that chance favors the prepared mind. The book also describes how amateur scientist Joseph Priestley stumbled onto the existence of oxygen in the eighteenth century and how television pioneer Philo Farnsworth developed his idea for a TV screen while plowing his family's Idaho farm.

Physics,Erich Hausmann,physics,First published in 1939,/works/OL192356W?edition=ia%3Aphysics00haus,/authors/OL2235925A/Erich_Hausmann,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6390553M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1939|Publisher  D. Van Nostrand Company, inc.|Language English|Pages 756","PREFACE    THIS text aims to present the essentials of Physics to college students who major particularly in science, technology, or engineering. It is intended to give a gradual and logical approach to the subject, to develop and illustrate the fundamental concepts clearly, and to afford a mastery of the basic principles of this fascinating branch of natural philosophy. To those who study Physics for its cultural value, the text should aid in developing a power of analysis that will be useful in any career.    Many years of teaching and professional experience have led the authors to devote considerable space to the subject of Mechanics, so that this initial part of the book may be found clear and understandable even by the student without previous training in Physics. The subsequent parts have been treated with more and more conciseness in keeping with the increased comprehension of the well-grounded student. This policy has been carried out also in connection with the handling of units, the inclusion of worked-out problems, and the mathematical steps in formulating the results.    The book should be found suitable for courses in which all parts of the subject are covered in one year, or for individual courses in Mechanics, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism, and Sound and Light that extend in the aggregate over longer periods. A number of the more advanced sections in the various chapters have been starred; these may be omitted in the shorter courses, but may well be used as additional assignments for the gifted student. It is expected that class work will be supplemented by demonstration lectures and laboratory experiments.    In presenting derivations of physical laws and relationships, the purpose of the proof and the course to be followed are stated before embarking upon the detailed description and mathematical processes. In working out the illustrative examples, attention is given to the units of measurement involved, and in the early part of the text the units are carried through the various steps and balanced. These details of presentation will aid the student in acquiring clarity and definiteness of thought, and should enable him to analyze and solve original problems with confidence.    The gratifying reception accorded the first edition of this book has encouraged the authors to believe that they have met, at least in part, the objectives they had sought. They have carried out the revision along the same general lines, striving for greater clarity and usefulness.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Particular emphasis is placed on path integrals and Hamiltonians. Financial mathematics is currently almost completely dominated by stochastic calculus. The present book is unique in that it offers a formulation that is completely independent of that approach. As such many new results emerge from the ideas developed by the author. This pioneering work will be of interest to physicists and mathematicians working in the field of finance, to quantitative analysts in banks and finance firms and to practitioners in the field of fixed income securities and foreign exchange. The book can also be used as a graduate text for courses in financial physics and financial mathematics.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Focusing on the relationship between structure and properties, it provides a well- balanced treatment of the mechanics and the materials science of composites, while not neglecting the importance of processing. The book has been revised and updated throughout, with new chapters on fatigue and creep of composites. The text presents a detailed description of how the various reinforcements (such as, glass, polyethylene, aramid, carbon), the materials in which they are embedded (ceramics, metals, polymers), and of the interfaces between them, control the properties of the composite materials at both the micro- and macro-levels. Extensive use is made of micrographs and line drawings to emphasize the importance of of processing, microstructure, and properties in composite materials. Examples of practical applications in various fields are given throughout the book, and extensive references to the literature are provided. The book is intended for use in graduate and upper-division undergraduate courses, but practicing engineers and researchers in industry and academe will also find it a useful reference. About the author: K.K. Chawla has taught and done research at institutions in Switzerland, Brazil, Canada, and the US and has served as a consultant to industry, national laboratories, and government agencies. He is currently at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. His books, used as texts throughout the world, include Ceramic Matrix Composites (1993), Fibrous Materials (1998), Mechanical Metallurgy.

Special Problems,Time-Life Books,photography,First published in 1972,/works/OL11080360W,/authors/OL1458877A/Time-Life_Books,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL19831497M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1972|Publisher  Time-Life Books|Language English|Pages 209,"The special problems of photography -- and there are many -- seldom discourage the serious photographer.  On the contrary, these problems stimulate his interest, their goad prodding him to some of his finest pictures.  They excite him to stretch and extend the outer limits of his knowledge, and in the process acquire a better understanding of the full capacities of his camera, equipment and ingenuity.  The shot considered a routine assignment by an experienced professional may be a hazardous adventure for the beginner.  But for photographers of every rank, certain special problems are universal.  One is the all-pervasive power of nature's extremes; under the lash of a freezing rain or the heat of a summer sun, simply preserving film, lenses and camera -- let alone getting a good picture -- is a severe test.  More exotic perils include the dust, fire and explosions of an erupting volcano or an insidious fungus that will spread over equipment in the damp tropics.  Mechanical failures that ruin a picture can be avoided by foresighted testing.  But far more common are the problems of setting -- reflections, obstacles, distances that get in the way of clear and dramatic pictures; yet all can be got around by the proper technique.  There is one classic problem that has plagued and intrigued photographers since the development of the camera and can never be fully solved: how to convey a sense of action in the utterly motionless medium of still photography.  But the attempts to resolve this problem lead to pictures that communicate the idea of action to the viewer.  These problems, while not those of every photographer, are basic to the entire photographic experience.  To understand their traps is to begin to realize ways to avoid them.  Or to make use of them.  For some of the most exciting pictures are those that are deliberately shot the wrong way -- and turn problems into advantages.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Abrams|Language English|Pages 320","From the vantage points of the other planets in the Solar System, it’s increasingly clear that a form of life capable of space travel lives on the third sphere from the Sun. If the rolling, rust-red topography of Mars, or Jupiter’s eruptive moon Io, or the ethereal rings of Saturn could speak, they might even be able to describe what that life-form looks like. It invariably comes in a carapace of hardened metal. Moving at an extremely high rate of speed, it pans and scans ceaselessly, using glass eyes and other senses. It either absorbs energy from the Sun, or feeds itself with radioactive power—the former via beautifully symmetrical wings, the latter from radioactive cells distended, at a strut-like arm’s length, a safe distance from its hyperactive sensory organs. And it always reports everything it sees and senses—everything—back to its home planet. This is achieved through an umbrella-shaped high-gain antenna, capable of projecting a “voice” consisting of a high-speed, digitized chain of zeroes and ones, back to its home world.  That voice doesn’t report in words. It sends pictures. Thousands of them. In the past four decades, the small squadron of robots that have been launched to explore the Solar System has produced an eye-openingly visionary body of work, one that easily ranks with the greatest achievements of landscape photography. Extensive archival research and years of image-processing have produced the first comprehensive assessment of this genre. ""Beyond: Visions of the Interplanetary Probes"" pulls together 295 of the most spectacular images from the history of robotic space exploration – including four 45-inch-wide panoramic gatefolds – to create an awe-inspiring visual narrative journey through the planets.

The relationships between photography and time are manifold: time can be directly represented within the image, it can be its theme and philosophical horizon, but it can also represent the global framework in which photographic practices develop and change through time. It is the ambition of this book to bring together the various aspect of time in photography as well as of photography in time, and to illustrate them in a series of case studies that focus on seminal authors (e.g. Fox Talbot, Victor Burgin, Robert Morris) and genres (e.g. spirit photography, montage photobooks and tableau photography), with examples ranging from the very first photographic pictures to the most recent cross-medial uses of photography in and outside art.

"" Le photographe habite une société de loisirs consommés. Il y chemine d’habitats nouveaux en centres commerciaux, de stations balnéaires en quartiers de plein air, de parcs de loisirs en zones d’activité. Il campe sa chambre face au bonheur factice d’une appropriation individuelle, au front d’une catastrophe collective dévoilée ou potentielle. Il instruit en tension la beauté généreuse du paysage et la clarté assurée de sa détérioration. Peu importe qu’il s’agisse du Gers, de la banlieue parisienne ou marseillaise, de telle ou telle station de montagne ou de bord de mer. Le constat est présent, non comme une dénonciation qui n’aboutirait qu’à une prise de position somme toute banale, mais comme une proclamation politique du doute. Les photographies de Jürgen Nefzger ne se corsettent pas en un art engagé aux formes prisonnières d’un discours simplifié, elles sont une invitation à la pensée complexe dans le plaisir assumé des sens et du sens.""

In doing so, Robbins and Becher produce work that functions as surreal nonfiction, using documentary images to examine contradictions of place and cultural identity."" ""The work posits vital questions for a globalized world: What are the larger implications of ""ideological passing,"" when one culture assumes the skin of another? And what role can photography play as a document in a context where cultural signification is entirely fluid? Curator and author Maurice Berger examines the work of Robbins and Becher within the context of race and colonialism as well as Surrealism; critic Lucy R. Lippard looks specifically at ideas of the manipulation and simulation of place and identity in the duo's work.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This new photographic series has been carried out during hiking trips along the northern French coast. Paul D'Haese focused on the border between the built-up country and the wide sea. The northern French coast is marked by history: the Atlantic Wall, the liberation, the refugee camps. With this in mind, the artist has investigated all kinds of interactions in a non-documentary way: the ones between land and sea, solid and turbid, intern and extern, locked up and liberated. Paul D'Haese linked these themes to the search for identity, with the 'borderline' personality disorder as the extreme case. Three years ago, he conceived, for the first time, the idea of exploring this boundary line. Since then, he has been following a route, about 350 km as the crow flies, from Bray-Dunes to Le Havre. He has crossed about fifty villages and towns, with his camera, first by car, then by bicycle, and finally on foot. Borderline follows Winks of Tangency, a project where he only 'touched' the surface, the screen, the wall, the border. This time, he perforated the borderline by photographing it. As with his previous project, the exhibition is the subject of a publication: 'Borderline'.

The resulting eerily beautiful, landscape-like images reflect Sasaki's near-devotional attention to Canadian art history, and to the legacies of the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson.

The book brings together actions, photographs and collages made in recent years. Insisting on repetition and reproduction, wounds of images, technical failures, shadows, photocopier's footprint on material and fractured temporalities, Lucia manifests her ideas about body, art and existence. Photographs, installations, sculptures, audios and small actions and video performances build the images that make up this photobook, where we can appreciate the interest of the artist in the austere encounter between the image and the word, as if one auxiliary to the other, took her out of rest. Lucia is interested in altering the photographic record. Damage the image. Subtract it, dig into your bones.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To photographer Lieven Herreman, however, it is, if nothing else, a self-portrait: a physical rendition of his search for a fragile and ambiguous self-image. The basic idea of his method is abstracting styling and self-image from his subjects. He almost forces them into surrendering to his camera and becoming his vehicle for the ultimate image. On the one hand, the woman wants to resist the attack she is goddess, she is strong and imposing but on the other hand she also wants to surrender she s also fragile and vulnerable. This duality of resisting and surrendering, of being goddess as well as being fragile, is the essence of Herreman s work.

But there is also a vulnerability that foreshadows social division and political conflict: strikes in the subway, the black protest movement, children playing in dusty and gloomy street corners. Åsberg's pictures depict a New York that no longer exists, but he also captures what has been and suggests what is to come.  I Sven Åsbergs fotografier moter vi det tidiga 1960-talets optimistiska varldsstad: skyskraporna i glas och betong, skridskoakare i Central Park, va lbesta llda shoppare pa Madison Avenue, badsugna manniskomassor pa de offentliga stranderna. Men dar finns ocksa en utsatthet som forebadar social splittring och politisk konflikt: strejkvarsel i tunnelbanan, den svarta protest- rorelsen, barn som leker i dammiga och dystra gathorn. Åsbergs bilder skildrar ett New York som inte langre finns men han fangar ocksa det som varit och antyder det som komma skall.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The massive backlit transparencies measured 60 feet wide by 18 feet tall and changed every few weeks between 1950 and 1990, resulting in a total production of 565 Coloramas. Eastman Kodak Company conceived of the imposing size and vibrancy to demonstrate the brilliance of color photography, and thus, the company's color film products. The idealized lifestyle presented in the Coloramas was intended to celebrate family or travel snapshooting, reinforcing the idea that color photography was the best way to memorialize all of life's moments.""--Back cover.

This inquiry is translated into haunting images that are usually created in the studio, requiring long periods of preparation. His work therefore reads as an ode to slowness. Meticulously constructed black-and-white compositions are contrasted with Callemin's ongoing exploration of the portrait, resulting in a selection of enigmatic and refined images. This book is published on the occasion of a solo exhibition of Callemin's work at FOMU Antwerp and includes a text by Taco Hidde Bakker. Exhibition: FoMu, Antwerp, Belgium (24.06.-02.10.2016).

Having spent his early years shooting commercial beauty and fashion, Buckmaster soon shifted focus to more personal projects, challenging conventional notions of beauty and celebrating the eccentricities of those whom society might classify as ""misfits.""  Echoes of Buckmaster's early career remain, in the form of exquisite costuming, make-up, and scenic design. Despite an element of performance, there is an undeniable rawness to these portraits, in which subjects are both aware of the camera's gaze and sympathetically self-conscious, robing and disrobing, revealing and concealing ... Arranged in three movements: Imposing, Revealing, and Inventing, this collection progresses from traditional portraiture to increasingly intimate portrayals, as subjects expose, create, and invent themselves. Included in this endlessly varied spectrum of characters are Burlesque performers, families, brides, lovers, and all manner of tattoos and body piercings. There are classical reclining nudes, reminiscent of Édouard Manet's Olympia or Titian's Sleeping Venus, dancers with incredible physical strength and dexterity, women costumed as peacocks and geishas, a contortionist inside a trunk, even a green-skinned man, bejewelled like an Indian deity""--Publisher's description.

For the past eight years, Stan Raucher has spent countless hours photographing on metro systems in over a dozen cities on four continents including New York, San Francisco, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Paris, London, Rome, Vienna, Shanghai, Delhi, and more. His candid photos of ordinary people interacting with one another and their surroundings reveal an intimate glimpse into a variety of human emotions and interactions. These evocative, richly-layered images are like still photographs from a movie or play, and each of the scenes invites the viewer to evaluate the situation and then to generate a unique personal narrative. At a time when fewer of the images that we see on a routine basis are honest representations of real life, these photographs open a window to the world that actually surrounds us here and now.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At the time there was much discussion about the problems of the welfare state with crime, drug abuse, and enduring poverty. In 2010, a meth dealer had murdered a woman and her picture appeared in the local newspaper. Wolin recognized her as the subject of several of his earlier portraits. He decided to locate the residents of the projects that he had photographed before and to show how their lives were going, a full generation later. Over the past five years he re-photographed over 100 individuals. The economic condition of many remains poor, while others now live solidly middle-class lives. More than a few are firmly entrenched in the criminal justice system, usually for non-violent crimes such as lack of payment of child support or drug use. America has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. Wolin's focus is on the faces themselves paired with the earlier portraits. One can see the effects of the passing of time and the ways in which experiences in life - good and bad - are written into these open and expressive faces.

He became the leading exponent of a fierce new photographic style that corresponded perfectly to the abrasive and intense climate of Tokyo during a period of great social upheaval. His black and white pictures were marked by fierce contrast and fragmentary, even scratched, frames, which concealed his virtuoso printing. Between June 1972 and July 1973 he produced his own magazine publication, Kiroku, which was then referred to as Record. It became a diaristic journal of his work as it developed. Ten years ago he was able to resume publication of Record, which gradually expanded in extent. To date he has published thirty issues, a number of them including colour. The publication of Record as a book enables work from all thirty issues to be edited into a single sequence, punctuated by Moriyama's own text as it appeared in the magazines.

Created over the course of three years, by Australian photographer Tom Blachford, the surreal images function as portals in time, with the homes, cars, and beautiful scenery appearing almost exactly as it all did 60 years ago. The crisp moonlight adds a new dimension to the famous mecca of desert modernism and shows a contrasting side to a town famous for its sunshine, cocktails, and hedonism. Working closely with the Palm Springs community Blachford gained remarkable access to some of the most coveted architectural jewels in the area, including the Kaufmann House, Edris House, Frey House II, Sinatra House, and dozens of restored Alexander Tract homes in the valley. Blachford's work builds on the famous documentary and lifestyle approaches of Julius Schulman and Slim Aarons, but injects a signature mystery. His cinematic aesthetic acts as a stage for an untold narrative, inviting the viewer to script their own drama going on behind the walls of these historic homes. This original, lush work is a rich contribution to the record for those mid-century architecture and design lovers fascinated by Palm Springs.

It is a feast for the eyes for anyone who loves the Great Lakes, winter and the beauty of nature. Surprising plays of light and sculptures of ice are the reward for braving bone-chilling temperatures. It captures ice and water doing battle; the stunning pink of sunrise as seen through the prisms of countless ice shards; and the wildlife of Lake Huron as they hunt and play. These images captivate the senses and may even create a longing for those frosty mornings, when snow crunches underfoot and one's breath can be seen.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Son travail est un processus continu de variations et d'échos. En mettant en évidence ces multiples relations, cette mobilité constante, les images photographiques et filmiques qu'il réalisa dans les années 1920-1930 constituent des documents uniques mais aussi de véritables outils d'analyse et de création. Sous quatre parties, le livre présente plus de 170 photographies et bandes-film. On découvre d'abord la vie de l'atelier - l'artiste, ses modèles et amis comme Man Ray. Viennent ensuite les oeuvres reproduites, seules ou en relation, sous différents points de vue et éclairages. La troisième partie pourrait s'intituler le travail de la reproduction ; elle rassemble des images d'objets industriels et des recherches, à partir d'une même prise de vue, sur les recadrages, les formats et les tirages. La dernière partie est consacrée à des études de matière, de mouvement, et se clôt sur la construction de la Colonne sans fin. Les bandes-film et nombre de photographies sont ici publiées pour la première fois. Trois essais éclairent les relations entre le travail sur l'image et la pratique sculpturale de Brancusi. Ils sont complétés par un inventaire thématique inédit des photographies et une première description des films, restés jusqu'à présent invisibles."" P. [4] of cover.

Women have played an important role in the development of photography, often pushing boundaries and defying social convention. Through Women's Eyes showcases the most influential women photographers of the modern and contemporary eras: from Diane Arbus and Nan Goldin to Yoko Ono and Roni Horn, along with many others. The artists featured in this book offer us their own interpretations of the world, filtered through the camera, and show us what is worth looking at among the barrage of images that bombard us. Their strength is the ability to combine languages--not only photography, but elements of cinema and painting as well, resulting in a collection of views that encompass the human experience.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This period of radical change generated an unprecedented creative energy which breathed new life into Japanese photography. By the mid-1950s, Japan was at a crossroads between tradition and modernization, a moment fraught with contradiction, immortalized by the most talented photographers of the time."" ""The 150 photographs in this collection represent a unique vision of a nation struggling to define itself. These images are accompanied by essays from renowned Japanese experts, who provide social and historical insight into this period and its photographic output.

Khader followed the everyday life of a Syrian rebel fighter as they fought Assad's technologically superior forces. Often, they did not know where the enemy was- mortar fire coming from somewhere in the distance and the constant threat of sophisticated Russian UAVs targeting them from above kept him awake most nights. Though Khader came from a place far removed from the destruction and chaos that had taken hold of their home, the rebels, whose youth had been given to war, kept him safe while documenting for this book. Many of the fighters you will see in Martyrs' Brigade have since lost their lives in the Syrian War. Those that survived have regrouped in the Northwestern region of Syria, or have fled the country. Some have become mercenaries in Libya under the control of the Turkish state   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
HDR_nature,Yoshinori Mizutani,photography,First published in 2018,/works/OL32264607W,/authors/OL11698983A/Yoshinori_Mizutani,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Amana|Language English|Pages 112,"""HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. This technique expresses the difference between the lightest light and darkest dark that are possible to capture in a photo. The process consists in merging several photographs of the same scene, shot with varying shutter speed combinations, in order to attain a greater dynamic range of luminosity than with a single photograph. The images are then blended together automatically, or in postproduction, in order to create a single image presenting the most focused, the most well-lit and the most colorful parts of the scene. To some extent, the final images are the result of a fully automated process. Oftentimes, the images made using HDR present outrageous contrasts and uncanny temporalities. The world seems to unveil all its facets, as if the day and the night were present at the same time. HDR_nature intends to tweak this normal set of operations. Mizutani explore this technology that is always more common in contemporary photography as a way to discover new images, and at the same time, as a challenge to expand the possibilities of photography. In particular, by moving the camera while shooting, Mizutani forces the software to the limits of its ability to represent reality. By slightly disrupting the process of reproduction, his series gives rise to a whole range of unplanned and welcomed visual combinations. Captured with the HDR rendering algorithms, the familiar forms of the natural environment are transformed into pleochroic patterns in half-light color gradient. Our eyes are constantly reframing the shapes and the contents, the foregrounds and the backgrounds, the obscurity and the clarity.

This series of essays complicates periodization and places, rather fixed, in which they are inserted in dialogue with the international development of photographic modernism and the opening of photography to other aesthetic practices.. Foundational readings and new approaches by leading specialists expand the interpretation of the multifaceted corpus of both artists. The European journey, the training in the Bauhaus, the influence of avant-garde cinema and the New Objectivity, the look at Buenos Aires in modernization, the documentary and ethnographic paths, design, advertising and mass media frame an exploration of the visual method with which Stern and Coppola defined the modern experience. To complete this vision, we gather for the first time in a volume and in an exhaustive way, the first and programmatic reviews of his works, the articles, aesthetic reflections, essays and interviews that not only expand the context of meaning of his photographs, but also immerse us in the debates on modernity, tradition and avant-garde that dominated the first part of the twentieth century in which they actively participated establishing a fruitful aesthetic dialogue between Europe and Latin America.""

This publication is a unique mix of art photography, Frank's view on the art of perception, his passion and the story behind his work. Frank considers himself a visual artist with a strong affinity with the past while living in the present. His contemporary works often have a melancholy feel about them.

An innovative documentary photographer, Abbott pioneered the depiction of scientific subject matter and photographed the fast-changing landscape of her times. Abbott studied journalism for a year in Ohio before moving to New York in 1918 to study sculpture, where she met Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray. She later moved to France in the 1920s and worked for Ray in his portrait studio before setting out on her own. Her portraits captured many individuals associated with avant-garde art movements, including author James Joyce and artist Max Ernst. Moving back to New York at the end of the decade, she began her renowned Changing New York series (later published as a book in 1939) and went on to become picture editor for Science Illustrated.

In the midst of the Cold War, the Werkstatt initiated an artistic 'airlift' to the United States, a democratic field of experimentation beyond the pale of traditional vocational and political-institutional standards. Those same years witnessed the establishment of infrastructures in West Germany that paved the way for the emancipation of photography as an art form. These included 'documenta 6' (1977), the first photo galleries and photography journals, and a number of pathbreaking exhibitions. Berlin, Hanover, and Essen played important roles in that process. All in all, the picture of a medium in transition emerges, a medium that developed an autonomous form of artistic authorship in the field of documentary. This book presents the story of German photography in the 1970s and 1980s, its international ties, its protagonists, and its networks.

It's such a simple question, but choosing the right lens or lenses is actually one of the most important photographic decisions you can make. Nothing affects the quality of a photo more than the lens. It's no longer just about the megapixels-it's the glass that makes all the difference! Many first-time buyers of DSLRs don't venture past the basic lens included in the box. While some are reluctant to spend more money, others are confused by all the buzzwords or are overwhelmed by all the choices out there. It's really a shame, because interchangeable lenses give you amazing scope for quality photography. Take in vast sweeping scenes with a wide angle lens. Capture faraway birds with a telephoto lens. Examine the tiniest detail of a flower with a macro lens. Record the perfect portrait with a prime lens. Anything is possible when you choose the right lens for the job! This book isn't a simple catalogue of available lenses. New products are coming out all the time, and comparing specific lenses can be difficult. Instead, author N.K. Guy gives you all the information you need to make smart buying decisions. Optical technology is demystified, arcane terminology is decoded, and practical tips are provided.

Short nights of the Shadow Catcher,Timothy Egan,photography,First published in 2012,/works/OL16681748W?edition=ia%3Ashortnightsofsha0000egan,/authors/OL403781A/Timothy_Egan,//archive.org/services/img/shortnightsofsha0000egan,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Language English,"How a lone man's epic obsession led to one of America's greatest cultural treasures: Prizewinning writer Timothy Egan tells the riveting, cinematic story behind the most famous photographs in Native American history and the driven, brilliant man who made them. Edward Curtis was charismatic, handsome, a passionate mountaineer, and a famous photographer, the Annie Leibovitz of his time. He moved in rarefied circles, a friend to presidents, vaudeville stars, leading thinkers. And he was thirty-two years old in 1900 when he gave it all up to pursue his great idea: to capture on film the continent's original inhabitants before the old ways disappeared. An Indiana Jones with a camera, Curtis spent the next three decades traveling from the Havasupai at the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the Acoma on a high mesa in New Mexico to the Salish in the rugged Northwest rain forest, documenting the stories and rituals of more than eighty tribes. It took tremendous perseverance -- ten years alone to persuade the Hopi to allow him into their Snake Dance ceremony. And the undertaking changed him profoundly, from detached observer to outraged advocate. Eventually Curtis took more than 40,000 photographs, preserved 10,000 audio recordings, and is credited with making the first narrative documentary film. In the process, the charming rogue with the grade school education created the most definitive archive of the American Indian. His most powerful backer was Theodore Roosevelt, and his patron was J.P. Morgan. Despite the friends in high places, he was always broke and often disparaged as an upstart in pursuit of an impossible dream. He completed his masterwork in 1930, when he published the last of the twenty volumes. A nation in the grips of the Depression ignored it. But today rare Curtis photogravures bring high prices at auction, and he is hailed as a visionary. In the end, he fulfilled his promise: He made the Indians live forever. - Jacket flap.

However, until now, only a handful of Chinese books have made it onto historians' short lists. Yet China has a fascinating history of photobook publishing, and The Chinese Photobook reveals for the first time the richness and diversity of this heritage. Now available in a smaller size, this more accessibly priced hardcover edition is based on a collection compiled by Martin Parr and Beijing- and London-based Dutch photographer team WassinkLundgren. And while the collection was inspired initially by Parr's interest in propaganda books and in finding key works of socialist realist photography from the early days of the Communist Party and the Cultural Revolution era, the selection of books includes key volumes published as early as 1900, as well as contemporary volumes by emerging Chinese photographers.

Collectively these images--which include scenes of crimes, reconstructions of crimes, and documentation of evidence and police procedures--offer a cutaway view of society over the course of the first half of the twentieth century.

Balet was touched by the beauty of the scene, the two white bodies revealed by the lightning of the electric flash, and was struck that this was the point where technology met romanticism, where the future met the past, and the blue light of the new world met the golden light of classical painting. Connecting the ephemeral, vacuous, anonymous nature of an out of control digital world with long-lived cultural references, Balet questions how yesterday links into tomorrow. This book explores the dominance of media screens in contemporary life, from surgical simulators to interactive sex, from a connected family gathering to the violence of video games. Her images also refer to the narcissistic self-awareness expressed on social networks and the new approach to quick, light mobile photography that affects our visual culture.

Are your digital photos hogging your hard drive instead of hanging out in snappy albums and archives? Looking for ways to improve your prints beyond simple snapshots? The popularity and convenience of digital photography has led to more pictures being taken, but fewer being turned into beautiful prints, framed, put in photo albums, and shared with others. The majority of users do nothing with their images for two reasons: the results are disappointing and the process of improving and preparing images for print is daunting. Written by popular photographer, columnist, and digital imaging expert Jon Canfield, this book shows you how to easily enhance and prepare your digital images for printing. Step-by-step instructions and tutorials coupled with full-color images and screenshots explain how to use Photoshop CS2 or Elements for color management and correction; editing images for printing, including properly sizing, sharpening, and converting to monochrome; to fix lighting; and more. You'll also learn how to take your printing to the next level by: using different print technologies, papers, and inks; selecting Raster Image Processors; framing and mounting their prints; self-publishing; and effectively working with print services for the best output possible.

The existence of similar convictions in some African countries suggests that the cult may have been brought to Iran from southeast Africa through the Arab slave trade. This history is rarely spoken about but these winds and the traces they have left on the islands and their inhabitants are the touchstone for Hoda Afshar's 'Speak The Wind.' Through her subtle and perceptive images of the extraordinary landscapes, the people and their rituals, Afshar's beautiful and complex book attempts to picture the wind and its psychic entanglements, to form a visible record of the invisible.

From her first exposure to the world as the girlfriend of the future King of England to her death as perhaps the most revered figure of the century, she captured the imagination and the love of literally hundreds of millions of people. And, from her first portrait of Lady Diana Spencer in 1980 to her last shoot months before Diana's tragic death and finally to Diana's funeral, Jayne Fincher -- the only female royal photographer working with the explicit approval and full cooperation of Buckingham Palace -- was there. Granted unprecedented access to the Princess of Wales and the extended royal family for 18 years, Fincher amassed an enormous archive of more than 30,000 striking images of Diana. She captured on film Diana's transformation from a shy, awkward teenager to an elegant and sophisticated woman. Diana: Portrait of a Princess collects in one spectacular volume for the first time ever the best of these extraordinary photographs.  Here are some of the most famous images of Diana ever published...and here also are hundreds of never-before-seen candids, outtakes, and portraits, the definitive photographic document of Diana's life -- as fiancee, wife, and then ex-wife of the Prince of Wales; as mother to princes William and Harry; as philanthropist, as ambassador, as fashion muse. But more than a simple collection of images, Diana: Portrait of a Princess is a personal and deeply felt memoir with behind-the-scenes insight into the moods and complex personality of Diana. This narrative, a collaborative effort with royal writer Judy Wade, incorporates detailed impressions and experiences gathered in photographing the Princess. Featuring more than 500 pictures -- three-quarters of them never before seen -- and including dozens of revealing anecdotes, Diana: Portrait of a Princess is all exquisite tribute to a woman who carried the hearts of the world in the palm of her hand.

Each of these family slides is a biography written in the vernacular. From the fidelity of the badly framed to the awkwardness of exposed self-consciousness, they bear the evocative authenticity of oral history. What makes them so compelling is their unassuming nature. To engage with these pictures sensitively and introspectively is to enter into a bond with them; by admitting us into the past of these other families, they lead us back to ours. These pictures are genuinely real and gently dreamlike. Like the sound of leather heels on pavements, their colours are from another period. They are more naive, more impressionable; they elicit a nostalgic response and conjure a homesickness for the land of the past, and then they question it. They are both vivid and vague, part spectacle, part spectre, mirroring the fading of time and memory.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The soul of the camera,David DuChemin,photography,First published in 2017,/works/OL19713260W,/authors/OL6711115A/David_DuChemin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 273,"""The photograph can be an astonishing means of connecting and communicating with others. But with over one trillion photos taken each year, why are there so few successes? Why do so many fail? With advances in camera technology, it is not because the images lack focus or proper exposure; the camera does that so well these days. Photographer David duChemin believes the majority of our images fall short because they lack soul. And without soul, the images have no ability to resonate with others. They simply cannot connect with the viewer, or even--if we're being truthful--with ourselves. In The Soul of the Camera: The Photographer's Place in Picture-Making, David explores what it means to make better photographs. Illustrated with a beautiful collection of black-and-white photographs, the book's essays speak to topics such as craft, mastery, vision, audience, discipline, story, and authenticity. The Soul of the Camera is a personal and deeply pragmatic book that quietly yet forcefully challenges the idea that our cameras, lenses, and settings are anything more than dumb and mute tools. It is the photographer, not the camera, that can and must learn to make better photographs--photographs that convey our vision; that connect with others; that, at their core, contain our humanity.""--provided by Amazon.com.

The author explains what it meant to alternate between the Catholic Church, to which her mother went, and the Mexican Patriarchal Church, where she went with her father and that teach a spirituality made of syncretism, together with the conviction that bridges can be established, through trance, possession, and clairvoyance, with the dead.

From his teacher, Ulloa not only inherited the chair of Photojournalism in the School of Journalism of the University of Chile, but also the rigor in the subjects, the artistic and social sensitivity, and the mastery of the technique; the framing and the art of the laboratory. An important part of his work served as a basis for the Exposition Face of Chile, of October 1960, sponsored by the university, which traveled the continents with three hundred and fifty large-scale extensions. The itinerancy of the exhibition concluded in 1969, at the Osaka World Fair. Fifty of the photographs that make up this volume were part of that show that revealed Chile to the world.

Verder zijn er gemanipuleerde foto's met gefantaseerde, vaak niet-uitvoerbare sculpturen op locaties over de hele wereld te zien. In het kasteel hangt het werk van haar moeder, de schilderes Martine Antonie (1909-2006) (pseudoniem van Tonny Röling-Grolle), maker van kleurrijke landschappen met figuren. Met haar expressieve schilderijen gaf Antonie uiting aan haar liefde voor de natuur en de ongrijpbare en onbenoembare levenskracht die zij als nieuwsgierige reiziger overal ter wereld ervoer.

Among them were also the creators of the animation on which he focused. 'I am fascinated by the idea of ​​capturing the moment when a person withdraws into himself, closes off to his own world and disconnects from the viewer. You can't know what he's imagining or thinking. At the same time, the picture shows the inner world of the subject and the story you tell yourself about him. Animators are artists who create their entire visual cosmos themselves. It only exists in their minds and then becomes reality. This is a sign of living art, it doesn't stick to formulas because there are no formulas, it's just the realm of infinite freedom'  Timo Viljakainen aloitti taiteilijamuotokuvien kuvaamisen 1990-luvun alussa. Heidän joukossaan oli myös animaation tekijöitä, joihin hän keskittyi. 'Minua kiehtoo ajatus vangita hetki, jolloin ihminen vetäytyy itseensä, sulkeutuu omaan maailmaansa ja katkaisee yhteyden katsojaan. Et voi tietää, mitä hän kuvittelee tai ajattelee. Kuvassa on samaan aikaan kuvattavan sisäinen maailma sekä tarina, jonka kerrot itsellesi hänestä.""Animaationtekijät ovat taiteilijoita, jotka luovat itse koko visuaalisen kosmoksensa. Se on olemassa vain heidän mielessään ja muuttuu sitten todellisuudeksi. Tekijöiden luovuus on lähde näille maailmoille, joissa kaikki on mahdollista. Tämä on elävän taiteen merkki. Se ei kangistu kaavoihin, koska kaavoja ei ole. On vain loputtoman vapauden valtakunta. Animaation maailmaa kirjassa avaa Heikki Jokinen, joka on seurannut animaatioelokuvaa yli neljä vuosikymmentä ja kuulunut monien maailman keskeisten animaatiofestivaalien valintalautakuntiin sekä tuomaristoihin   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

'The slow low land' is the first in this series and depicts the diversity of the Dutch landscape through the eyes of famous Dutch photographers. The emphasis hereby is on four different topics that all play a part in defining the Netherlands: the landscape, the city, the interior, the portrait. While looking through the lens of a camera, the exhibition zooms in on dunes, rivers, nature, cities, streets, interiors, classrooms and people. 'The slow low land' provides a surprising view of the Netherlands, which is partly thanks to the quirky vision of the photographers in the exhibition, which also includes videos, and the accompanying book with the work of Gunhild Ang, Céline van Balen, Wout Berger, Dicky Brand, Annejet Brandsma, Koos Breukel, Noor Damen, Wim van Egmond, Romy Finke, Tom Janssen, Tahné Kleijn, Jan Koster, Natascha Libbert, Hellen van Meene, Hans van der Meer, Sam Otte, Gerco de Ruijter, Frank van der Salm, Bert Teunissen, Hans Wilschut en Edwin Zwakman""--Publisher's website.

Avec de modestes appareils photographiques, elle entreprend à la fin des années '70 de se photographier dans des tenues provocantes qu'elle achète dans des magasins de lingerie sexy avant de les transformer. Elle assume la précarité de ses tirages évoquant les affiches de concerts, les couvertures de revues underground qu'elle encadre de satin, de velours, de dentelles et de plumes, qu'elle greffe de néons aux mots simples éclatant comme des slogans au-dessus de son corps dénudé. La photographie est pour elle une étape dans un plus long processus: la simplicité du dispositif aisse entrevoir le plaisir de ce rendez-vous devant l'objectif, un rituel où le spectateur est autant confronté au corps du modèle qu'à son regard même, tour à tour spectateur ou voyeur.

Here, we can see ? and this list is not exhaustive ? female figures, parts of bodies, closed-off interiors that are often empty, abandoned or run-down, spaces, floors and wide-open ceilings, plays on natural or artificial light, the presence of mirrors that are concealed to varying degrees, trivial accessories such as fabrics, curtains, clothes, woollen threads, cotton, chairs and armchairs that have become worn with use, small figurines, marbles or festive confetti, primary colours and other shades that are, frankly, lacklustre. But, proceeding in this manner, would we knowingly enter this world, of which Kumi Oguro shows us carefully designed and selected sections? A world ? a story ? that is equally about what she wants to reveal, but which she does not describe to us, and what we are encouraged to discover on our own.

Motionless and illuminating, they occupy the sea of space Cindy Wright created for them in the magnificent installation Eye To Eye (2020). Proudly and defiantly, the figures look us right in the eyes. They are staring at us. Once eyes, now there are only gaping holes. These arresting charcoal drawings depict human skulls. Wright presents us with our own mortality, fringed with a white border, like a memorial card. Nevertheless, death is her greatest fear. 'The death of my loved ones, the idea of my own death and how it would affect them.' Standing eye to eye with our transience takes courage. Wright manages her fear as a key concept in her oeuvre. Mark Twain expressed this concept of courage born out of resistance as The mastery of fear. Wright's studio illustrates this mastery. Her collection of dead animals and insects reads like a macabre Wunderkammer and forms the basic material for her search for images to represent the fragility and vulnerability of life with the greatest intensity. It took the artist ten years to collect the desired number of skulls for Eye To Eye (2020). She became fascinated by their origins and the way society interacts with human bones, evolving through time and culture. For Wright, her collection of skulls is something very natural.

Unlike other of his contemporaries such as Max T. Vargas, Emilio Díaz, or the Vargas brothers; Montesinos was not linked to the commercial use of photography and resorted to it only to express his free and contemplative spirit in front of the Arequipa countryside, its volcanoes, its dazzling skies and clouds and its own home. The book edited and written by Dr. Andrés Garay, in co-authorship with Jorge Villacorta, is another chapter within a two-decade research carried out by the authors, with the aim of revaluing the great development of Arequipeña photography in the first decades of the 20th century and includes critical essays by plastic artist Blas Isasi, photo curator Cecilia Salgado and brothers Sebastian and Alfonso Montesinos Belón, sons of the photographer.

It dominated European photography from the 1880s to the 1920s. The pictorialists celebrated visual beauty, sought to convey expressive moods, and emulated the way things are seen in real life, with softened lines and lack of sharp focus. To achieve special effects, they manipulated the appearance of their images using complicated printing and tinting techniques.00This is the first book to introduce the early masters and masterpieces of Finnish pictorialism, featuring a selection of new scholarly articles accompanied by a rich compliment of stunning photographs. What were the aesthetic philosophies of Fritz Englund, Oiva Kallio, Daniel Nyblin, Alfred Nybom and Johannes Schalin? And who were Finland?s first female proponents of pictorialism?00Exhibition: Finnish Museum of Photography, Helsinki, Finland (28.01.?24.04.2022).

Although photography was in its infancy at that time, the revolutionary uprising in Paris was extensively documented. Images of the destroyed Paris were often used in the bourgeois press to underscore the alleged barbarity of the Commune. In turn, the portraits of the men and women of the Commune, many drawn in captivity, gave a face to the unknown Parisians. This richly illustrated book, published on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Paris Commune, offers a unique look at the revolution through numerous photographs and documents.

Her work in that book made her, in the words of Arthur C. Danto, ""the Atget of vanishing New York, prowling her city at the other end of the day, picking up pieces of the past in the present, just before it is swallowed in shadows."" This book is a further exploration of the urban landscape at dusk and dawn, with a new focus on the effects of the recent economic turmoil on New York and other American cities. Shuttered stores and empty lots in city centers and fringe areas alike reveal a haunting and disquieting beauty. Occasionally, a person or the artist herself is visible as a ghosted image or shadow. Photographs in 'Dark city' also counter-balance signs of loss with a more optimistic message. They reveal a natural cycle of decay and rebirth in urban ecology, as objects such as ladders and brooms signal that the work of renewal is under way. 'Dark city' is ultimately a dynamic and ongoing dialogue between defined place and empty space that will fascinate general readers and urban specialists alike.

"Architecture, photography and the contemporary past",Claes Caldenby,photography,First published in 2014,/works/OL22924753W,/authors/OL1122417A/Claes_Caldenby,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Art and Theory|Language English|Pages 176,"""As traces left behind by the last two hundred years of profound historical change, architecture and photography contribute both to our contemporary skyline and to our image of the past. Their common history thus provides an indispensable background to every discussion of what has been called the contemporary past - that is, to modernity considered as an open problem rather than a closed historical period. Architecture can be seen as a kind of ""macromodernity,"" a social scope where the diverse discourses of modernity have assumed their most large-scale form. In analogy, photographic media constitute a ""micromodernity"", where the underside of modern society has been registered, identified, classified, and archived. In both cases, we trace out the irregular borderline between the discursive and its opposite, the ""material"". At this point of intersection, an interesting confrontation between traditional academic historiography and an artistic application of historical perspectives might be staged. What contribution can architecture and photography make to the exploration of our contemporary past?""--Page [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After the camera,Thom Rouse,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL20036416W,/authors/OL7609908A/Thom_Rouse,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 127,"Thom Rouse seems to have an unbridled artistic sensibility. In this book, he offers up for review sixty of his favorite fine-art images. Rouse takes photographers behind the scenes of his creative process, showing the starting point-always a portrait, captured by him-and then details the Photoshop tools and techniques he used and, sometimes, some ""accessory"" images that he adds into the mix, to create a dramatically different work of art. While the components and tone of each image vary from page to page, Rouse strictly maintains that his creative process is based on the idea that each work of art must, at its core, remain photographic. In other words, his fine-art works are enhanced, stylized portraits that transcend the limits typically self-imposed by portrait artists. His goal in creating the book is to educate and inspire other photographers-or, in the words of the artist-to ""show you something you haven't seen before."" This book features a collection of beautiful portraits that collide with a strange collections of elements-one portrait, entitled Shhhh, is coupled with ornamental wooden fish, goose wings, and parts of an aircraft; another, called Andromeda, uses complex Photoshop blending techniques and texture layers to create a Gustav Klimt-inspired feel in the photograph-to create a storytelling piece that elevates the portrait to a fine art category. On page after page, you'll discover how Rouse conceptualized the featured work of art, the steps he took to bring the concept to life, and the curiously beautiful artistic portrait result.

The only book that shows you how to do it: pictures first, words second. Michael Wright argues that words spoil most photography books, which are overcomplicated by too much text. It should, he argues, be possible to understand the sequence of events in a photographic or computer process without having to read the text. Photography is a visual process, and the best way to get it across, simply and easily, is visually. We rose to that challenge in the design of this book. We took out everything that wasn't absolutely essential, and illustrated every conceivable step; and it has proved to be remarkably effective. We applied this approach to all areas of digital photography, from composing and taking the shot in the first place, to manipulating the image on a computer, using either Photoshop Elements or Photoshop 7. The result: a completely unique guide to digital photography.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Angelika Krinzingers konzeptionelle wie intime fotografische Serien reflektieren immer auch die inhärenten Bedingungen und die Geschichte des Mediums. Jede Fotografie zeigt per se einen Ausschnitt der Welt, und die Welt erst einmal als Oberfläche. Krinzingers extreme Nahsichten, etwa in den Body Details oder auch in Muttermilch oder Ambras, beziehen ihre Tiefe aus dem Wissen um die Geschichte der bildlichen Körperdarstellungen ? ihre nie voyeuristische Fotografie abstrahiert und zeigt die Möglichkeit eines Blicks auf Sexualität und Körperlichkeit gleichermaßen sachlich wie zärtlich. ""Die Künstlerin gibt Einblick in ihr fotografisches Werk, das geprägt ist von ihrem Interesse an den Strukturen und Oberflächen von belebten wie unbelebten Dingen und geleitet von einer Sehnsucht nach dem Sichtbarmachen von Größe und Stärke, im Kleinen, im Detail.""

But also through stories that arose from the imaginations of writers who had never set foot in China themselves, but whose work nevertheless strongly influenced the Western view of China. With China's increasing visibility on the world stage, a wave of discussions and misunderstandings has arisen about its politics, economy, technology and culture. With the exhibition China Imagined, the two China-based curators He Yining and Ruben Lundgren have brought together a relevant selection of contemporary photographers who have been active in China over the past ten years. In doing so, they show the ambivalence, complexity and diversity of Chinese society. China Imagined tries to understand the current construction of Chinese imagination and to investigate the problem of photographic representation in intercultural contexts. In times of uncertain international relations amid a global pandemic, the exhibition seeks to help bridge the undeniable gap of misunderstanding between the Western and Chinese audiences.

He photographs places that have been marked by armed conflicts in the past. For inhabitants, this is often no more than the backdrop against which they live their lives. However, politics have a way of subliminally impacting on people's habits and dictating behaviour.

Observations from 15 towns in Västra Götaland County on the western coast of Sweden.  In darkness, I am searching for light like a moth. A street lamp, a lit window, a neon sign, or the light of a summer night sky that never completely fades out. And the opposite: the winter days, when the darkness is grafted into days early, days that never really want to brighten up. As I look at the blackened houses, the empty streets, the desolated park benches, the bikes in their stands, parked cars, I get the feeling that time has stopped and the surroundings, now quiet and still, await a new day's life and movements - Jan Töve.

In response, he took his camera and began a touching and intimate chronicle of the elderly man's gradual deterioration over the next six months, until finally passing away in the comfort of a hospice, no longer able to speak but with his pain alleviated to the best degree possible. Bol could not have predicted that he would end up making the series White Crow, or what would result from the process of inevitably saying goodbye to a loved one. Interspersed with pictures of his father are the crows and ravens that appear frequently in Bol's work, which he views as symbols of transformation and harbingers of eternity.

It is a story from the inside of a universe we have rarely seen described in this light. Skateboarding is often shown as rock-n-roll and dangerous tricks, but it is also a sensitive perception of the human experience of the gap between youth and adulthood. SLIP is the 99%, the everyday skateboarders. Portrayed here is youthful doubt, searching, loving, and a community surrounding skateboarding. The book takes us by the hand into the lives and the emotions of a portrayed group of skateboarders. The pictures from SLIP have won international awards, among others the main prize at the Italian photo festival Cortona On The Move 2012, one of the images was on the cover of the first book about the Danish skateboarding history 'Dansk Skateboarding'. The project was shown alongside an interview with Asbjørn Sand in the New York Times' photoblog Lens.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nyfikenhet är en övergripande gemensam nämnare för de fotografer som är med i utställningen, men i övrigt skiftar deras drivkrafter mellan intresse, dyrkan, slump, övertygelse, förrättning, tvång och studiesyfte. Benämningen ""fotograf"" kan för övrigt diskuteras.

At the same time, i.e. roughly between 1960 and 1990, she compiled a collection of landscape photographs, from the roadside as it were, as part of her travels, her Road Trips through Austria. They featured wild sculptures in the form of electricity pylons, scarecrows, car wrecks, and the dilapidated façades of houses.

Ihre Frauenbildnisse sind ebenso Urbilder der Weiblichkeit wie zeitgenössische Frauenporträts. In ihren sogenannten Lappenbildern hingegen zeigt Hain dramatisch konstruierte, im Wind tanzende Stoffe inmitten von Naturlandschaften. Das Spiel zwischen Offensichtlichem und Verborgenem, zwischen Realität und Täuschung nimmt dabei eine zentrale Rolle ein und fordert den Betrachter heraus.0Die Publikation vereint diese unterschiedliche Themenkomplexe aus Antje Hains Schaffensphasen und bietet einen umfassenden Einblick.

From a process that utilizes techniques of collage and montage emerges a very personal way of looking at the ephemeral nature of things, whether printed matter (magazines, books) or natural objects (shells, minerals, driftwood). Antonsson's analogue cuts and repetitions seize upon the allegorical potential of image fragments, freeing fashion and erotic photography in an exploration into the gendered side of this clichéd history.

This is why Karolin Back uses precisely these motifs as source material for her works. Through subsequent scrutinizing, dissecting, and rearranging, she creates images that reveal almost nothing of their original connection to reality. Instead, she offers completely new projection surfaces, which consciously create irritation and throw the viewer back upon himself, so that familiar patterns of perception can be questioned and playfully broken. In the installation, Karolin Back deals with the tension between the fixed moment and the passing of time. The starting point is an image of the Matterhorn, probably the most famous mountain peak in the Alps. It is, however, not about the Matterhorn itself or a documentation of the journey there, but rather about the representation of time. By overlapping photography and video, the artist layers disparate temporal levels over each other ? the photograph freezes the moment, thus creating an antithesis to the progression of time in film.00Exhibition: C/O Berlin, Germany (29.04.-02.07.2017).

The images are however infiltrated by another presence, that of a fellow artist, Jan Håfström, whose earlier work 'The Eternal Return' is overlaid, subtly and sometimes almost imperceptibly, onto Pedan's own. That Håfström's series bears a similar, although from the perspective of the philosophical tradition significantly transformed, name as Pedan's, seems to set up a particular resonance between them, two series crossing and intersecting, without merging into a third unity.

De landschappen van Wageningen,Wim Huijser,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32083711W,/authors/OL286630A/Wim_Huijser,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Uitgeverij Blauwdruk|Language Dutch|Pages 239,"Wageningen is surrounded by a unique variety of beautiful landscapes: a wooded moraine, the gardens and fields on the narrow, rugged floodplains, a remnant of levee and a green wet valley. How did those landscapes come about? What are the special characteristics? What do you notice about that in the city? What role did people play through time? At the initiative of Mooi Wageningen, Wim Huijser wrote The Landscapes of Wageningen. He made use of information collected by the association about the structure, water management, the characteristic elements and the flora and fauna. He interviewed residents and delved into literary history.  Special historical maps were found in the archives, and members of the Camera Club Wageningen provided photos of today's landscape. This book became a richly illustrated and versatile ode to our own environment. With The Landscapes of Wageningen you can better understand that environment and you will be inspired to discover and experience even more. Every day and every season  Wageningen wordt omringd door een unieke variatie aan prachtige landschappen: een beboste stuwwal, de tuintjes en de velden op de eng, ruige uiterwaarden, een restje oeverwal en een groene waterrijke vallei. Hoe zijn die landschappen ontstaan? Wat zijn de bijzondere karakteristieken? Wat merk je daarvan in de stad? Welke rol speelden de mensen door de tijd heen? Op initiatief van Mooi Wageningen schreef Wim Huijser De landschappen van Wageningen. Hij maakte gebruik van door de vereniging verzamelde informatie over de opbouw, de waterhuishouding, de karakteristieke elementen en de flora en fauna. Hij interviewde bewoners en dook in de literatuurgeschiedenis. 0In de archieven werden bijzondere historische kaarten gevonden en leden van de Cameraclub Wageningen leverden foto's van het landschap van nu. Zo werd dit boek een rijk geïllustreerde en veelzijdige ode aan onze eigen omgeving. Met De landschappen van Wageningen kun je die omgeving beter begrijpen en raak je geïnspireerd om nog weer meer te ontdekken en te beleven.

Orbit,Tom Callemin,photography,First published in 2020,/works/OL32083670W,/authors/OL11640315A/Tom_Callemin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Des Palais|Language English|Pages 13,"In Orbit different projects from Belgian artist Tom Callemin, made in the past four years, are compiled and accompanied by short descriptions to give insights on how the images came about. The book is designed as a binder with foldouts. The title Orbit refers to the principal theme in the book, which is 'time' and the idea of things reoccurring within it. Some images explicitly refer to these 'orbits' by portraying the moon or the sun on their path, which is humans' way to measure the passage of time. Des Palais is a collaboration between Belgian visual artists Tom Callemin and Bieke Depoorter. Both Callemin and Depoorter studied photography at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, where Callemin is affiliated as a researcher. Depoorter is a member of the photographic cooperative Magnum Photos.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An end and a beginning to something new. It includes photographs from 10 previously published books, together with some twenty never-before-seen pictures, that weave together into a completely new story. ""All of the photographs are striking, all of them exert a pull on us, all of them are filled to the brim with atmosphere and meaning, which the viewer takes in immediately, at first glance. And they are all connected, all related to each other, by virtue of the artistic temperament and the worldview of which they are an expression, and which is to be found in a characteristic tonality or timbre that is easy to recognise, but hard to define. They are existentially charged, a loop of rope has no less of a presence than that of a sleeping soldier, simply because it exists, I think, and the pictures explore differences in the way that which exists, exists."" - from Karl Ove Knausgård's text in Case Closed   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A kind of misplaced places that have awakened the photographer's desire to record the views with his panoramic camera. Martti Jämsä's landscapes in the work are introduced by Jukka Viikilä's Runo / Poem. The city lives and changes. Martti Jämsä has captured in his pictures something fleeting and yet permanent, perhaps lasting and perhaps something beautiful. This is not an even and exhaustive picture of Helsinki. The goal has been a purely personal vision of the living environment as it comes across with all its contingencies when walking around with a camera. Martti Jämsä uses traditional analog photography technology, film and chemicals. For this reason, he wanted to include one Selenium-tinted silver gelatin print that he himself printed and signed for each book.  Martti Jämsä on kiertänyt ympäri Helsinkiä muutaman vuoden ajan etsien tuttuja ja tuntemattomia näkymiä kaupungista, näkymiä, joihin ei välttämättä tule kiinnittäneeksi huomiota. Eräänlaisia ohikuljettuja epäpaikkoja, jotka ovat herättäneet valokuvaajassa halun tallettaa näkymät panoraamakamerallaan. Martti Jämsän maisemiin teoksessa johdattelee Jukka Viikilän Runo / Poem. Kaupunki elää ja muuttuu. Martti Jämsä on vanginnut kuviinsa jotain ohikiiltävää ja silti pysyvää, ehkä kestävää ja ehkä jotain kaunista. Tämä ei ole tasapuolinen ja tyhjentävä kokokuva Helsingistä. Tavoitteena on ollut puhtaan henkilökohtainen näkemys elinympäristöstä sellaisena kuin se kaikkine sattumanvaraisuuksineen tulee vastaan kuljeskellessa kameran kanssa.0Martti Jämsä käyttää perinteistä analogista valokuvaustekniikkaa, filmiä ja kemikaaleja.

'Japan Works' is the result of her journey through Japan in the autumn of 2019. Using a pre-compiled list of places with exceptional architecture, Konrad took thousands of photos in Tokyo, Itoigawa, Kyoto, Nagoya and Osaka. In addition to mostly iconic, post-war Metabolist architecture, Konrad also took a large number of photos of nonspecific architectural moments and infrastructure that, with the same intensity, give their own impression of the architectural landscape in Japan. Free associations of full-page photographs alternate with contact sheets documenting her itinerary.

In it, photos taken over a period of five years with Alakoski's phone camera, are presented on paper. Many of the images were originally manifestations of Alakoski's online presence, while some remained private and unpublished, to be equated with sketches or drafts. In 'Book - An endless row of selfies? they are displayed in a dated but non chronological order, in relation to the text that they were originally published alongside or thought up with. Many of the images depict Alakoski herself, and are therefore self portraits or selfies. In the book, as a consequence of containing both text and images, a perspective takes shape in which the term -selfie - is not seen as the once trending word that is now near forgotten or at least dull, but as a an appropriate term form a specific type of contemporary photography. Namely; a photo of someone that also took the photo, taken with a phone camera. The book furthermore contains an essay, which accounts for the phenomenology of the selfie, as well as for the circular affect, generating opportunities for reflection, self communication and new perspectives that Alakoski upholds that the selfie as a photograph has. The text grants importance to the presence of the photographer, in the moment that the photo is taken, as well as to the implicit presence of the gaze of an other, and detangles how the selfie as a photographic genre highlights performative aspects of identity rather than naturalises them.

Exposed to vulnerability,Ole Jauch,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32109454W,/authors/OL11649436A/Ole_Jauch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Forlaget Jelling|Language English,"Does exposure define vulnerability or does vulnerability defines exposure.00How is photography actually defined? Is it through the exhibited vulnerability that the photographer stands up and gives a clear signal that he wants to maintain the situation or is it the vulnerability in the situation that makes the photographer stop, adjust to the situation and take his picture. From both angles, vulnerability plays a role. Often the role of the photographer is double-edged, both as the vulnerable and as the one who perpetuates the vulnerable. I would argue that when this is the case, the one who assumes both roles are also the one who is best at retaining them.00By that, I mean at the same time, the photographer who is not afraid to show his vulnerability and put it into play can bring home the best images.00Vulnerability is the strength of the strongest and bravest.

Portraits de héros ou d'anonymes, compositions en studio, paysages naturels, veillées funèbres chrétiennes ou musulmanes, scènes de la vie quotidienne : ce livre présente un siècle d'images exceptionnelles, évocatrices d'un pays d'Europe que le vent de l'histoire a largement soumis aux influences orientales de l'Empire ottoman. L'histoire de la photographie albanaise commence avec l'incroyable aventure d'un Italien, Pietro Marubi. Partisan de Garibaldi, Marubi, fuyant la répression, trouve refuge en Albanie. Il s'installe à Shkodra où il ouvre, en 1858, le premier studio photographique du pays. Trois générations se succéderont, instituant l''importante dynastie Marubi. Au fil d'un siècle, toute la société albanaise va prendre la pose dans leur studio, devant leurs décors peints.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After his studies at the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven [1960-1965], he worked for 'Hitweek' and De Gruyter, among others. It took a while before he came out with his autonomous work, but after that it went quickly: since 1974 he has been exhibiting at home and abroad. As early as 1982 [in the introduction to Dumont Photo 4, Photography in Europe heute] Dr. Ingeborg Leijerzapf signaled the pioneering work with the Polaroid SX-70. He was also one of the first to use a wide-angle lens. In 1989 he was one of the few Dutch photographers to have a solo exhibition at the Pompidou Center in Paris. The work is now in numerous museums and important [private] collections. The Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam recently added more than thirty works by the De Nooijers to its collection for the first time. Over the years, not only has the photographic art of Paul, Menno [collaborating since 1989] and Françoise risen to new heights, the genre of staged photography, autonomous photography, has also matured  Paul de Nooijer fotografeert al meer dan een halve eeuw. Na zijn studie aan de Academie voor Industriële Vormgeving in Eindhoven [1960-1965] werkte hij onder meer voor 'Hitweek' en De Gruyter.

And more than situating or interweaving different disciplines, three authors reflect, rehearse, print, exemplify and conceptualize the genre of illustrated books with photography: photobooks. The text - in a poetic tone - talks about the creation, structure, morphology of photobooks and their possibilities of reading. The written word is associated with photos that reproduce, in some cases, the same content from different points of view; at other times-spaces antagonistic themes are opposed to generate meanings through opposition. However, in both cases, the purpose is to build series or sequences of images, which, in turn, are developed through graphic design .The book was published by two publishers: one located in Buenos Aires; the other, in Madrid. In both books, the design of the covers varies. The black tone distinguishes the edition made in Latin America and its cover indicates the parts of a book: head, forehead, mouth and foot; the opposite part replicates the colophon of the obverse.

I boken berättar Leif medryckande om sina lärorika och ofta äventyrliga möten med bland andra Ralph Gibson, Imogen Cunningham, Larry Clark, Bruce Davidson och systrarna Elizabeth och Erica och Lennard. Berättelserna vittnar om en tid när fotografin etablerar sig som en självständig konstart och där möjligheterna tycks oändliga.

Edström made his first visit there in 1993 and has continued to do so intermittently. Shiotani is comprised of only forty-seven inhabitants and most of the people who live there still farm traditionally, harvesting rice, tea and mushrooms. The first pictures he took there were no more than a record of his trip. It only became an artistic project fifteen years later in the Christmas of 2008 when he made up a photo album for his wife's grandmother. Opening with rural vistas where houses and their inhabitants make only occasional interventions on the landscape, the book goes on to focus on the family's day to day activities. Edström brings the viewer on family trips, recording the train rides, car parks and lunch tables with as much care as he records the mountains and the details of the landscape around them. From late nights drinking to the passing of time and the losses that accompany it the focus of his photography remains on his extended family. Edström and his camera bear witness to the passing of both of his wife's grandparents, and the rituals that accompany death in the rural community. Over the twenty-three years this book covers, Edström notes that, 'There is a sense of change, but of slow change, a pace and energy quite different from my long-time residence in Tokyo. The village has a sense of isolation. When I first visited, my mother-in-law talked about the American soldiers giving them chocolate as they trooped past, but when I arrived, they hadn't seen a Westerner in a long time, and they were all very curious. They were curious, but also very welcoming, quickly becoming used to me and learning not to react to me taking pictures'   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The archive of Bernard Taylor,"Taylor, Bernard (Amateur photographer)",photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32149808W,/authors/OL11668021A/Taylor_Bernard_(Amateur_photographer),/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Understory Books|Language English|Pages 141,"In his preface, filmmaker Peter Ward describes acquiring the archive of Bernard Taylor, an enigmatic former resident of his suburban New York village. Ward selected and edited this group of Taylor's papers: intimate worksheets that combine a series of photographs, maps, and postcards with illusive short texts that were clearly created for Taylor's private study. Ward's editorial interjections - all relating to local history - punctuate the book, and blur distinctions between fiction, biography, and reportage.  An afterword by The Publisher contextualizes Taylor's worksheets, critically re-examines Ward's editorial practices, and describes the agonizing process of preparing this edition. The Archive is equal parts photographic narrative, fiction, puzzle and mystery - an obstructed view of an inward journey that explores the outside world. The questions and answers remain with the reader to piece together.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He has a special eye for the grotesque, the poetic and the playful. JOURNEY is his first photo book. The photographs in the book have been selected by Rasmus himself in collaboration with graphic designer Louis Montes. They reflect both the concrete journey; many of them are taken along the way on actual journeys, either with the family or at work, snapshots of everything that happened around him in the meantime, and the abstract journey; the photographs are a story about the development that Rasmus has been through as a photographer. Finally, the selected photographs can hopefully give the viewer an experience - send him or her on a journey  Rasmus Weng Karlsen er en af landets bedste fotografer. Han har et særligt blik for det groteske, det poetiske og det legende. JOURNEY er hans første fotobog. Fotografierne i bogen er udvalgt af Rasmus selv i samarbejde med grafisk designer Louis Montes. De afspejler både den konkrete rejse; mange af dem er taget undervejs på egentlige rejser, enten med familien eller på arbejde, snapshots af alt det, der skete rundt om ham imens, og den abstrakte rejse; fotografierne er en fortælling om den udvikling, Rasmus har været igennem som fotograf.

Bruno V. Roels,Simon Baker,photography,First published in 2021,/works/OL32150715W,/authors/OL5170027A/Simon_Baker,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Hopper&Fuchs|Language English|Pages 198,"Bringing many years of work together in a single place, here on the page, rather than on the walls of a museum or gallery, we can consider both senses in which Roels thinks images are worth repeating. In the obstinate and dedicated labour of printing and arranging serial, but different, versions of single images together; and then also with regard to the overall effect of bringing these iterations of themselves into the same space. But there is another sense in which we might find Roels?s work echoing not only itself, but that of those that came before him; and that, funnily enough, is in his refusal to take himself, or his work, too seriously. Just seriously enough, it seems, to invest time, effort, and skill into the production of his complex and subtly nuanced work, but never to the point, that, like Ruscha before him, (the artist who made Various Small Fires and Milk), he finds himself unable to resist, and more importantly, to play with, the constraints of his own logic. A little like Dalí too, perhaps, who, captivated as he was by the potential of photography to document and catalogue the world, was also sure that this very capacity would result in us never being able to see anything in the same way, ever again. From ?the subtlety of aquaria? as Dalí himself put it ?to the fastest most fleeting gestures of wild animals, the photograph affords us a thousand fragmentary images culminating in a dramatized cognitive totalization.? That too, is something worth repeating.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Simultaneously he was photographing fellow gay men in their New York City apartments. Lewandowski combines his own photography with appropriated material, primarily Indiana high school yearbook photographs, as a dialogue on community and belonging, and a way to elaborate and expand upon his relationship to manhood and gay identity.

Her work mirrors her life and provides a visual echo of her voice as she gracefully negotiates themes of memory, boundaries, and violence. Faroq has a unique approach to working with her subjects, in that she regularly returns to them to continue sharing their journey. Many of these migrant, stateless individuals were with Faroq during her transitional period. 'I Don't Recognize Me in the Shadows', her first book, traces her journey and explores how everything happened: the war, the escape, the transition, and the unfamiliar.

A game where she challenges herself as well as the viewer. Improvisation is an important element in this game. Things happen by mistake. Wenzel questions the role of the camera and the one of the (female) body. She makes use of her own body as a model in order to convey an image by movement. Wenzel works in a fast, direct and very spontaneous way. Photographer and model become one. Performance is always present in her work. She sculptures an image by use of her body, gravity and the environment. She makes the viewer conscious of his or her own body, while narcissistically being occupied with that of her own. What is it like to be a physical being?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The quote on page 36 touches on a burning issue. We know that the pandemic originates from wild animals being caught and sold on markets and that their habitats in the forests are depleted. The pandemic has also exposed our fear of admitting weakness and vulnerability. A desireable result of this book is that it leads to discussions about our existence beyond political deadlocks. Kjell-Åke Jansson 'One kind of freedom, I realize, is forever gone. It is the freedom that comes with owning your own element.

The images in his series Splashes are characteristic of this approach: here, the focus is always on the ""backdrop"". Over the course of several evenings, the photographer invited friends to pretend to pose for him -- which allowed him to ""steal"" the situations taking place behind them. The photographs, taken with early cellphone cameras, have, for the most part, been reframed, so as to show only the situations and compositions that originally interested the artist. This tight cropping resulted in highly pixelated images, which the artist sometimes retouched to further accentuate the strangeness of the scenes he ""collects.""""--Publisher's website, viewed December 10, 2018.

Ltd.|Language English,"A constellation of freckles. Interlocked knees. A folded torso. The feminine rendered sculptural. Olivia Malone?s (b. 1982, American) Tonal is, at its core, a study of color. Married with her interest in the natural abstractions possible within the female form, the book is an embodied spectrum. Through fragmentation, Malone twists and turns the body into new shapes; a unique perspective transforming details of the figure into the unrecognizable. By the introduction of a myriad of textures, the project plays with light and material to create the desired tone. Not being defined or limited by skin tone, each photograph becomes hue specific. Whites, pinks, reds and browns are generated and assembled into a gradient of images, taking us from the absence of tone to the richly saturated and back again. Each image then stands alone as a sensorial study while also shaping the larger body collage. Whether submerged, contorted, or embraced, the language of the female body is redefined through distinct contours and imprints left behind.

Taking the maxim from Dieter Appelt ""A snapshot steals life that it cannot return. A long exposure (creates) a form that never existed"", Grierson makes beautiful images, which on the surface might appear to owe as much to the medium of painting as they do to photography. However, it is important to him that these are un-manipulated images straight from the camera: ""From the outset, my work has been largely about ""photographic seeing"" as I""m fascinated by what Garry Winogrand so simply described as ""how something looks when photographed"". Hence, a sense of discovery within the work itself is very important to me; finding something new that I didn't already know. There""s a huge element of ""chance, and the embrace of the happy accident within this approach, which is a sort of photographic equivalent of action painting. I""m often more interested in what something suggests rather than what it actually is, each image becoming a starting point for our imagination as it edges towards abstraction"" Yet what is unique about photography is that it always keeps something of the original subject. So there""s a dynamic duality, a dramatic to and fro in the viewer""s mind, between what it is and what it suggests. The marks and traces created by the moving light, at times have a simplicity like a child""s drawings. On occasion, the residue of a human figure might be reduced to little more than their posture or demeanor, which then seems more significant than ever, a sort of essence, whether that be elusive or illusive.""--provided by publisher.

The project is motivated by Kramer's position as an educator at the National Museum in Oslo, where among other things she mediated sculpture to children and youth. The title is borrowed from a quote attributed to Constantin Brancusi, supposedly describing Michelangelo's sculptures to a journalist in 1925: 'Michelangelo's sculpture is nothing but muscle, beefsteak, beefsteak run amok.' With his radical attitude toward art history and via his inquisitive and individual approach to the artistic process, Brancusi contributed to broadening the limits of how art could be experienced.

This duality extends further through the use of the ethical guidelines from both traditional social documentary and staged photography. The images are related to a subconscious understanding of aesthetic elements that do not necessarily depend on authenticity, which verifies the staged photograph's approach to social examination and reflection.  Geir Moseid har siden 2007 jobbet med serien Plucked som en gransking av hjemmets dualitet, sosial segregasjon, urban fremmedgjøring og mellommenneskelige forhold. Denne dualiteten forlenger seg videre gjennom bruken av de etiske retningslinjene fra både tradisjonell sosialdokumentarisk og iscenesatt fotografi. Bildene er relatert til en underbevisst forståelse av estetiske elementer som ikke nødvendigvis er avhengig av autensitet, noe som verifiserer det iscenesatte fotografiets tilnærmelse til sosial undersøkelse og refleksjon.

Door de jaren heen bleef de vraag naar het boek bestaan bij boekhandels en lezers. Een herdruk was op zijn plaats, maar geen gewone herdruk. In zeven jaar is een stad echter alweer enorm veranderd. Denk alleen maar aan het beeldbepalende gebouw van Forum Groningen. Fotograaf Robert Mulder besloot om alle foto?s uit het heden opnieuw te maken. De lezer en kijker krijgt zo een uiterst actuele mogelijkheid om het Groningen van nu te vergelijken met het Groningen van 100 jaar geleden.0Het aangezicht van de het universiteitsgebouw is na de brand in 1906 drastisch veranderd. De Gorechtkade was in 1919 nog in aanbouw en ook het Grand Theatre bestond nog niet. Waar vroeger de tram reed, rijdt nu de elektrische bus. Maar wie goed kijkt, ziet ook de overeenkomsten. De villa?s aan de Ubbo Emmiussingel zijn bijvoorbeeld nog net zo statig als vroeger   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
The awful German language,Jeffrey Ladd,photography,First published in 2020,/works/OL32304329W,/authors/OL7324606A/Jeffrey_Ladd,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Spector Books|Language English|Pages 251,"""An ex-pat's photographic homage to the dissonances of word and image. In 2011 the American photographer and Errata Books publisher Jeffrey Ladd (born 1968) moved to Cologne, Germany, and began photographing his surroundings while learning the basics of the German language. In the process, he collected lists of interesting German vocabulary words (professions, places, things, common terms and outdated terms), which he juxtaposes with his black-and-white photographs; two different types of language--one visual, one verbal--describing a sense of his new home. Borrowing its title from Mark Twain, The Awful German Language embraces a state where the combination of word and photograph can resonate or remain dissonant and confused depending on the individual reader. An index of definitions in English at the back of the book is provided as a learning tool, but one that requires some work on the part of the learner to decipher its code""--Publisher's website.

An expansion from his 2017 solo exhibition Elsewhere at the Centre for Contemporary Photography (Melbourne), his debut book 'Into Dust' sees Tunks construct fake astronomical photographs using found and accumulated materials, crushed and pulverised to mimic interstellar nebular. While these sweeping vistas are immersive and engulfing in their scope, their material listings come to form fascinating abstract texts, echoing the history of astrophotography and its pioneers, Edwin Hubble and EE Barnard among them, as astutely as they tease out Tunks' day-to-day.

He researches how he as a photographer can interfere in the landscape by working on an underlying lyricism in the images. The work can both be seen as a prophecy for the future as well as a desire to the past.

In continuing his research on the photographic medium and its formal possibilities, he experimented with applications of cyanotype, anthotype, and Van Dyke processes in traditional leather production.

Using his powerful photographs in mind-altering collages, he opened up and displayed inner vistas saturated with mystery, adventure and eroticism. Benson's rich visions mercilessly catapult the viewer into unchartered psychic and emotional territories filled with intelligence, humorous twists and turns, sexual fantasies, eerie people and spooky environments, all elegantly woven together in a turbulent tapestry celebrating the human imagination. 'Tom Benson: Visionary' contains 80 of his strongest images, and also includes an introduction by Carl Michael von Hausswolff, an interview with Benson's widow Marja Sipola Cuss, and personal mementos by Benson's muses and models Annika von Hausswolff, Helena Eriksson and Lotta Antonsson.

Rub with ashes,Dag Nordbrenden,photography,First published in 2012,/works/OL32825006W,/authors/OL11922911A/Dag_Nordbrenden,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Dag Nordbrenden|Language English,"Dag Nordbrenden, born in 1971 in Oslo, invents his own stories anew and leaves the serial work behind. Now, a poetic structure, which concentrates on individual marks, dominates his photography. Nordbrenden takes the viewer on a lyrical journey distinguished by melancholy, rigour, intimacy and long, lingering, and intensive glances. Displaying notes from a long journey through the inner life, personal experience and emotions, Nordbrenden's photography resembles a storyboard. The possibilities and the knowledge of a 'real' photographer, who governs his devices, help him in his approach. Revealing excellent technical skills, Nordbrenden shows little interest in demonstrating them. Instead, it is the cultural project that constitutes the focus of his work - along with the stories he wants to tell and involve us in.

Dialog mit Mi Fu,Daniel Rohner,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL32765647W,/authors/OL11899836A/Daniel_Rohner,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Kehrer Heidelberg|Language English|Pages 119,"For several years now, the Swiss photo artist Daniel Rohner has been addressing the theme of the landscape, as well as the aesthetics of Chinese art and philosophy. He focuses on ink-paintings by Mi Fu (1051-1107), whom Rohner sees as the chief witness of his own thought processes pictures which lend themselves to a new interpretation, an actualization or perhaps merely a translation into a new contemporary medium. Rohner climbs into the Rhine Gorge, which has dug its way deep into the mountain landscape of Grison between Reichenau and Ilanz; he explores Chur's backyard mountain Calanda and shoots photos in the Laufen Valley near Basle. These sites lie on his doorstep; they are familiar and visited frequently and this determines the compositions of Rohner's landscapes: peaceful, without any alpine heroism, prudently and precisely composed and, especially in their persistence, characterized by an almost meditative serenity, at peace with themselves. Traces of civilisation can be discerned, but, in light of the overwhelming nature, are restricted to a pure reminiscence of human existence.

"More cars, clothes and cabbages",Torsten Schumann,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL32765642W,/authors/OL11899834A/Torsten_Schumann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Peperoni Books|Language German,"The ludicrous story about a black dot and a passport control that starts the book already says a lot about Torsten Schumann and his view of the world.0His images even say more. Namely, that life in the so called civilized world is full of curiosities. Schumann photographs on the street, nothing special actually. And yet we see in his book the sinking of the Titanic, a woman who disappears under a magic hat, a sausage, which mutates to a ventilation tube, a designer furniture made of foam and bottom panels and a bikeway turning into a rushing river. The provided order is permanently infiltrated - by coincidence, incapacity or ingenious ideas.0But that the book is so much fun and at the same time so complex and cryptic, is not a coincidence at all. We owe it to the skills of the photographer and his special view of the world. And maybe a little bit also to the pearl effect cover with tin appeal.

In 'Screendump #1' (2011) the use of Google Street View was examined as a source of material for artists. In 'Screendump #2', the authors continue their exploration of the virtual photography with a closer look on the appropriation of photos found online. The publication shows the work of artists that run off with footage from amateurs. The overwhelming amount of online pictures changes the way we look at photography, the value we assign to photos and the role they occupy in our existence. Due to the arrival of smartphones the act of photographing has become a evident part of our daily lives.

The exhibition is a collaboration between the Hasselblad Foundation and the Finnish Museum of Photography inHelsinki, where it will be shown in the spring 2014 as part of Lindström's first major retrospective in Finland. The second volume in the series will be published then. The photographs in this exhibition originate from 1980-87. We see here the iconic pictures and many that have never been shown before. While studying at the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design (1981-84), Lindström experimented with photographic materials and went beyond traditional expectations and limitations. Inspiration came from surrealist and avant-garde art and literature. Pictorialism's gentle and painterly imagery is also a strong influence in her pictures from this period.

The project tends to question our relationship towards absence and loss and the need of physicality in the process of acceptance and closure. The book combines materials from different sources, such as family archives, reproductions of police and psychic files as well as photographs by Virginie Rebetez. This two year project is also a a reflection on the medium of photography. The status of each image is constantly shifting, offering new meaning and context to this open case. Delphine Bedel, the editor and publisher, and Virginie Rebetez worked together 6 months on this publication, with great attention details and to the narrative structure of the book. The roles of images and their haptic qualities keep shifting, family archives and memories becomes first police evidence and later tactile objets for the mediums and the artist, a fragmented representation of reality, a transformation process that Delphine calls 'the haptic image'.

His zero concept approach is impromptu in the sense that he often shoots at locations he has never visited before, meeting his models just before the photo session, frequently in their homes. The energy, humour, and expressiveness created in that moment is what characterises Dekker's work. Spontaneity and improvisation are crucial, often resulting in surprising and unforgettable compositions. Whether in London, New York, Tel Aviv, Milan, or his native Amsterdam, Dekker's discoveries are magical.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These chapters may for example include a fireworks factory, a funeral, a shooting, a broken camera, or a found note. Each chapter begins with a short text . These texts are reminiscent of those that one can find in the old adventure novels (whose purpose was to describe what kind of grand events that will happen to the heroes of the adventure, in the next chapter). In the adventures of Sunshine & Shadow, the chapter that follows is told through photographs. The words in the texts visualizes scenes and stories, before you see them, that creates a play with associations between the images and the texts. The texts builds up expectations of what is to expect, which, when not met, confuses, and forces the viewer to fill in the gaps, be a detective, and build stories and connections of her own. Sunshine & Shadow challenges and plays with the idea of reality, chronology and historiography, by creating a loosened narrative where events and thoughts from a period of the artist's life (translated into photographs and texts) falters freely between different times, between the actual world, inner visions, everyday life, fairy tale, construction, sunshine and shadow.

Narratives about man's place in a world where the power of nature and culture is difficult to master emerge in her carefully staged images, the production of which often involves set designers, craftsmen, and others. References to art history, and painting in particular, appear in Friberg's work, along with enigmatic spaces and an aesthetically pleasant play of light. This book gathers diverse examples from her body of work, telling stories that are both subversive and ambiguous in nature, drawing out our inherent curiosity.

Jest,Ilaria Turba,photography,First published in 2016,/works/OL32759670W,/authors/OL11897414A/Ilaria_Turba,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Peperoni|Language English,"Ilaria Turba is a multimedia artist working in photography, video, animation, and new media. 'Jest' deals with the archives of her Italian family, with pictures dating from the 1870s to the present. The images are not sorted thematically or chronologically, however, nor is there any discernible narrative. We are shown pictures of children at play, a family on holiday or at leisure, alongside snapshots of events, the city, or landscape. Large group portraits from over a century ago contrast with contemporary shots of random objects. The collage Turba creates thus raises questions of authenticity; an essentially photographic investigation of personal and public histories.

In de stad zijn grote projecten gerealiseerd, zoals de Stopera, de metrolijn naar Zuidoost en de IJ-oeverprojecten. Aan de rand van de stad was de Bijlmer nog maar net gerealiseerd en de Ringweg rond de stad moest nog worden aangelegd. Nu is de Bijlmer alweer voor een groot deel gesloopt en de Ringweg verdwijnt op allerlei plaatsen onder kantoorkolossen. De luchtfoto's in dit boek geven een verrassend beeld van hoeveel er veranderde, terwijl de stad toch ook hetzelfde bleef. De foto's uit de jaren zeventig werden gemaakt door Ger van Middelkoop; veertig jaar later maakte zijn zoon Marco ze nog een keer, vanuit hetzelfde perspectief, op dezelfde afstand en vaak ook nog met dezelfde bezonning. Soms worden radicale ingrepen zichtbaar, maar het gaat ook vooral om kleine, bijna onzichtbare accenten die werden toegevoegd, verwijderd of aangepast.

When separated from the concepts, logos and designs, the perception of the products becomes something completely different. This touches on our subconscious identification with well-known brands and how they are presented to us. Many products we buy have similar content but with a unique presentation that entices us to consume. In the second part of the art project the etheric and colourful have taken the concrete form of sculptures depicting overflowing and dripping consumer products and their packaging.

Described by Volk as 'a single, neon-hued hallucination', 'Laissez-Faire' is a meticulously curated meditation in which he uses his camera to capture the signs and symbols of capitalism and commodity culture. Individuals no longer experience reality directly, but instead live their entire lives behind screens. He collapses the usual parameters that shape our worldly existences - day and night, inside and outside, public and private, digital and real - into a feverishly imagined new universe, vaguely menacing and drenched in a cyberpunk sheen   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On 03.11.2011 a part of the north-east-coast was impacted by three major catastrophes: a naval quake, a tsunami, and lastly the explosion of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Deconstruction does not only causes annihilation, it also creates the occasion for new forms of life to emerge. 'tempête après tempête' portrays Fukushima through close-ups of inhabitants, scattered pieces of land, details of sea landscapes, moving elements of nature such as insects, humans, seaweed, pieces of bodies,? they all merge into a new and hybrid body. For Deubner taking close-ups is a way of working that is essential to her practice. Looking at things from a near perspective, gives her the opportunity to feel their materiality and texture directly through her eyes. It is as if the lens of the camera is an extension of her touch. It also allows her and her subjects to experience a form of contemplation.

During this walk he slowly falls in love with the landscape, the flora and the fauna and he thinks that this love is mutual. A special, surreal, humorous and confrontational dialogue is created between people, flora and fauna. At the climax the main character finds out if the love is reciprocal and chooses his path? The story is set in the dunes in connection with the continuous threat of the sea to The Netherlands.

Rauhallisina aikoina ihminen ei välttämättä joudu testaamaan moraalista sisintään, mutta kriisien läheisyydessä sekä yksilön että yhteisön puheen ja tekojen yhteys joutuvat koetukselle. Kuten eräs teoksen hahmoista sanoo: ?Eihän kukaan ole puheidensa veroinen, sillä lailla rohkea. Naurattaa oikein, kun muistaa mitä sitä kuvitteli. Että olisi ollut sellainen, millainen luuli olevansa.?0Hannele Rantalan Fiascon henkilökuvat ovat syntyneet kolmen vuoden aikana. Kuvien hahmot ovat useimmille tunnistettavia, vaikka emme myöntäisikään heitä tuntevamme. Kuviin liittyvät lainaukset ovat heidän puhettaan; puhetta, jota meistä useimmat käyvät sisällämme, vaikka emme haluaisi sitä myöntää. Teos on fiktiivinen, mutta totta.0Fiasco on teos myös kirjallisuudesta ja taiteesta. Hannele Rantalan teokset liittyvät kiinteästi kuvataiteen ja kirjallisuuden traditioon. Hän esittää kysymykset: mikä on taidetta, onko tämä taidetta? Millaisista aineksista taideteos syntyy? 0//0It was cold and lonely in the street.

Dépendant des adultes, on grandit là où ils vivent. Ma famille habitait entre Namur et Liège, de part et d'autre de la Meuse.0Dans la voiture, dans le bus, dans le train, je regardais le paysage se fondre dans la vitesse. Le défilement incessant d?images m?hypnotisait. Je me droguais à la vue de ce travelling sans fin, celui de mon propre road-movie. J?y projetais mes fantasmes d?une autre vie, qui aurait eu pour cadre ces milliers de paysages éphémères. Condamné à disparaître dans l?instant, chaque instantané m?offrait un autre monde possible. J?étais toujours déçue d?arriver, de sortir de l?univers de la fenêtre.0Depuis trois ans maintenant, je retourne régulièrement dans cette région. J?ai brisé la vitre de la voiture, du bus, du train, pour me jeter tout entière dans le paysage. À pied, je peux mettre mon vieux film sur pause autant de fois que je le veux et assouvir ma curiosité. Je pars à la recherche d'un monde disparu, celui des souvenirs de ma jeunesse. Je traque ses traces, je déniche ses reliques. Dans ces lieux qui m'inspiraient tant alors, des personnages apparaissent, des histoires se dessinent. Le quotidien gris d'une région marquée par les vestiges de l'industrialisation et un taux de chômage important me semble source d'une inquiétante étrangeté : il s'y passe autre chose. Influencée par le cinéma belge et sa poésie noire, oscil- lant entre fiction burlesque et documentaire social, je dresse le portrait subjectif d?un territoire, le mien. (C. L.).

Exploring the peripheries of large western metropolises, Grégoire Pujade-Lauraine's photographs study the built environments that harbour and shape human life, revealing the cryptic symbols etched across their surfaces and embedded in their shadows. The looming forms defy easy categorisation and disconcerting cyphers periodically emerge from a lingering dusk; an oversized key, a black concrete moon, or the illusion of a limitless temple.00Pujade-Lauraine?s photographs depict the mundane details of the urban environment, yet when brought together read like a set of tarot cards ? becoming open-ended allegories, their meaning awakened solely in combination. Double Orbit presents an elusive world, whose enigmas seem to emerge independently of the deliberate hands that built it, and which alludes to the oblique mysteries held on the surface of familiar surroundings.

The span of their making exceeds thirty years, but his focus remains the same - to create his very particular visual spaces, a tension between reality and imagination, form and material. Most of his photographs can be regarded as objects where the picture and the frame constitute an entity. Their configurations are precise and much considered, but the process also has moments that are very intuitive and spontaneous. Cogne's new publication shows his expressive works accompanied by a text written by himself.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

O. Hill. John Adamson remained an amateur; his photography had to be fitted in around his busy medical practice in St Andrews. The photographs are drawn mainly from two extremely early and significant albums, presented to the Museum in the 1940s.

If Ending resides before death and in its vicinity, Beyond the Mirror passes on to the other side of death. A journey in untouched land, with its starting point in Ending. With images from 'reality', the imagination helps to enter new worlds, as it's told by the photographer in the book's text, 'I want to travel in the crossroads between reality and fiction. The picture material has partially emerged during hikes at the Camino Santiago de Compostela. The tranquility and the well-being of hiking has opened my mind for thoughts and extraterrestrial experiences that have penetrated the pictures and enriched the reality we see with our eyes. At the time of the project, Leif Sandberg scanned old negatives and his father's holiday pictures from his archive. Her found images of deserted landscapes that conveyed an uncertainty about where you are and became part of the depicted fragility of our existence.

An attempt at a personal epistemology,Jeff Weber,photography,First published in 2018,/works/OL32575202W,/authors/OL11668422A/Jeff_Weber,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Roma Publications|Language English|Pages 521,"This book is the result of Jeff Weber's long-term project as Kunsthalle Leipzig, an institution which worked as an extension of his photographic practice and functioned as a conceptual frame to invite others to actively participate. His sequence of images documenting the renovation of the Leipzig apartments reflects the wish for a place created with a minimum of means and invested with freedom. Light seems to become a physical object in Weber's pictures, 'yet the quality of grey tones is mysterious,' writes Robert Beavers. Besides many photos and posters from the Kunsthalle, the book includes a critical text by Michael Baers and a conversation with the artist and Marie-France Rafael.

The book has a fragmentary structure based on shifts in perception through more or less abstract elements in relation to parts of the film 'Interbeing' and documentation of the preparations ahead of demonstrations on May 1, 2016 to 2018 in central Stockholm, Sweden. The material is presented through a thermal camera whose optics do not register what is visible to the eye but render shades of temperature, a perspective granting all living beings the same conditions of representation. The camera also makes a heat shadow visible upon and after physical touch. The heat remains, like traces of utmost commonality in attempts at making direct contact, as well as in public, everyday chance encounters. / Fotografen och konstnären Martina Hoogland Ivanows senaste bok 'Early Reading' utgår från en icke-linjär dokumentation av sociala strukturer och dess olika förhållningssätt till tillit och rädsla. Materialet är tagen med en värmekamera där optiken inte återge vad ögat ser utan nyanser av temperatur. Kameran synliggör även en form av värmeskuggor vid och efter beröring. Värmen stannar kvar som spår av det ytterst gemensamma.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The material spans from the past twenty years of Farazollahi?s artistic oeuvre.0Drawing inspiration from the rhythms of Haiku, the sequencing of images onto paper in Dismantling marks a trajectory in which the main concern is to underline an understanding of the photographic capture where everything moves, despite being in standstill as record. Sir Issac Newton stated that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.0With a cinematic approach to the image and its techniques, Farazollahi examines his statement closer. Albeit from the eye of an artist, rather than as a scientist. The result is a unique trajectory in the understanding of the still image, through a use of triptychs and repetition thus pointing at the mediums inherent lack of motion, sound and space within the photographic medium.0Farazollahi (b. Teheran 1978) is an artist and director of the artist run MELK gallery, and the editor of New Scandinavian Photography published by Black Dog.

Fotografierne suppleres med korte tekster af mag.art. og kurator på ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum Maria Kappel Blegvad, kunstner Nicky Sparre-Ulrich og fotograf Keld Helmer-Petersen. Gennem hele sit liv har Michael Utzon fotograferet, og som barn brugte han utallige timer i mørkekammeret, hvor han under kyndig vejledning af sin farfar, den banebrydende danske fotograf Keld Helmer-Petersen, blev introduceret til fotografiet. Under et ophold i New York i 2013 udviklede Utzon for alvor sit helt eget formsprog, der er karakteriseret ved organiske og farverige billeder i en stram grafisk komposition. Utzons blik fæstnes ved ting fra hverdagen, som han bevæger sig så tæt på, at de ofte fremstår uigenkendelige og abstrakte. I stedet lader han sammenflydende farver og grafiske mønstre træde frem. Fotografierne vidner om Utzons unikke evne til altid at se det skønne i tilværelsens abstrakte og til tider oversete strukturer og åbner for et rum til et nærstudie af virkelighedens oversete detaljer.

Rather, each scene allows us a glimpse into the action of the story Camille Picquot is unfolding. Released of its burden of proof, photography can now fully be applied to its new purpose: to visually narrate and suggest a fictional story. In her artistic work, Picquot is equally at ease with photography as she is with film. Applying and mixing common practices of these media, she never places one above the other, but rather reinforces them both. In 'Domestic Flight', Picquot does not shy away from adding a playful cameo of herself in the series, possibly hinting at Alfred Hitchcock's famous appearances""--Publisher's website.

For Lamon, photography is a never-ending process. For the artist's book 'Until the end : I will follow you', she tried to reveal the foundation of her photographic production, which turns out to be fragile and contradictory. This fragile, precious gem was created on the basis of intuition and rationality, on a fast and unconscious, yet similarly deliberate and slow way of thinking. Some thirty ambiguous images were printed on wafer-thin paper, like photographic ice crystals in which time has been frozen. Tina De Souter gave the book a sober and elegant design, further enriched with a poetic text by Birsen Uçar - also known as the voice of the atmospheric dream pop band Hydrogen Sea. The various production phases were carefully executed in consultation with Bruno Devos, the driving force behind publishing house Stockmans.

Die Betrachter erfahren nicht, wo diese Bilder entstanden sind. Ort und Datum gelten als wesentliche Indikatoren im Medium der dokumentarischen Fotografie, aber in ""Amerika"" werden keine Dokumente gezeigt. Die Herkunft der Fotos, Ort und Zeit ihrer Herstellung sind bedeutungslos. Der indexikalische Charakter von Fotografien wird verweigert. Entscheidend ist für Rabe der Bilderzyklus, die Reihenfolge, die Montage und Erzählung der Inhalte mit ihren visuellen Strukturen wie Kontrast, Rhythmus, Farbigkeit und Perspektive. Die Fotografien schweben in einem Illusionsraum, der Geografie und Zeitdimension neu definiert. Die Betrachter verorten die Fotografien in Raum und Zeit unter der Headline Amerika. In geteilter Autorschaft öffnet das erzählerische Verfahren von Carsten Rabe den Betrachtern die Möglichkeit, die fotografierte Lektüre mit ihren erinnerten Bildern eines imaginären wie realistischen Amerika in Übereinstimmung zu bringen. Amerika setzt sich bei der Betrachtung der Fotografien zu einer Realität zusammen, die nicht existiert. Die Betrachter werden mittels der Fotografien nicht über Amerika informiert, sondern sondieren den Zusammenhang zwischen erinnerten Amerikabildern oder Bildern, die sie Amerika zuschreiben, und den Amerikabildern von Rabe, die Amerika inszenieren.

Als die Angriffe begannen, hatte der Berufsfotograf Andres gerade Heimaturlaub und machte noch von seiner Wohnung aus und ohne Auftrag die ersten Bilder vom Anfang der grossflächigen Vernichtung Hamburgs, bei der rund 34 000 Menschen starben. Einige der Fotos, die Andres im Laufe mehrerer Tage zwischen den Angriffen aufnahm, gehören zu den ikonischen Bildzeugnissen der 'Operation Gomorrha'. Ein grosser Teil der Serie ist hingegen bis heute unveröffentlicht. Dieser Band dokumentiert Andres' Fototagebuch samt den Notizen des Fotografen erstmals vollständig, zeigt die Aufnahmen in ihrer Chronologie und verortet sie mithilfe historischer Karten. So lassen sich die Wege von Andres durch die Stadt nachvollziehen, und es entsteht ein genaues Bild der Zerstörungen auch dort, wo das nunmehr 75 Jahre zurückliegende Inferno zu einer völligen Umgestaltung des Stadtbilds geführt hat.

The pictures are taken along a multi-day walk outside of the Jotunheimen National Park, with no other purpose than to let the camera be as much as possible with the traveler's different visual and body impression in the face of a landscape that appears to be both sublime, monotonous, foreign and inexhaustible. Whether the landscape is a measure of aesthetic excitement or exaltation in Løkken's photographs, what is it?

J'ai compris que je me dotais d'une puissance imaginante sur ce lieu : je me mettais à regarder comme les peintres romantiques allemands, sans bien savoir qui ils étaient.  Me voilà entré, comme photographe, dans l'univers de ces peintres romantiques. La logique interne de la photographie présente le paysage sous une autre forme que la peinture, mais le peintre n'a pas tout imaginé comme on pourrait le penser.

'Occideia' depicts one subject?s odyssey, a chimerical trek through a culture-moulded environment. Occideia is a story built up in small episodes. A story with a beginning and end, birth and death. Intermittent events and phenomena tell about us people and our culture. In his photographs, Olli Oinas focused on sequences of black and white images of everyday and unimportant places. The result was soul landscapes, where idea and visual highlighting together build the content and power of the image. The work 'Occideia' by Olli Oinas (1948?2018) appears posthumously. The texts of the book have been selected from diary entries, where he considered the importance of art and culture in general and photography in particular.

In Myanmar, which was isolated for decades by a rigid military dictatorship, she photographed houses and living spaces in both cities and remote regions. She captured the traces of the inhabitants? lives and the signs of change. In DARK WHISPERS the ambivalent aspects of the British colonial period and its consequences are reflected and illuminated by short texts on the history of the houses as well as historical photographs. Minda?s photographs focus on the atmospheres of past lives and the forms of representation with which the inhabitants once sought to fulfill themselves. Often they are objects that have remained untouched for decades and bear witness to the cosmos of a vanished world. But there are also large gaps between then and now. An uncanny emptiness animates these spaces. Dark whispers echo through them?a memento mori to the many unspoken words of Burmese history.

Óscar is a perfectionist who has always enjoyed more the construction of his imaginaries than the achievement of a certain end. This book brings together many years of travel, observation and editing, a process that results in a capital and definitive work, a solid view of the author that manages to freeze slippery, elusive, almost ungraspable scenes; characters, streets and actions rescued from the smoke of time. They are random reincarnations of a Valparaíso that refuses to become a tourist scenario. They are not passive records: Óscar makes us perceive them as visual poems through which we reveal a mysterious atmosphere. His images are an intentional fragmentation that leads us to a totality by the path that marks its author"" (HKB Translation) --Verso cover.

Photographed over five years in various corners of the world, Berkofsky's Jugaad is a carrier bag of field notes collected while in exploration of heartlands. At play between body and landscape, literal and composed, the images are at once cartography and tapestry. Found objects form signs, figures wearing seams or shadows become maps; the details often overlooked show us the way home.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet the images are no longer set in the innocent atmosphere of the preschool years, when the world is read through analogies, but catapulted into a darker space of representation at the cusp of adolescence, against the backdrop of a hyper-commercialised world. The compositions create a distinctive play with logic, language, and meaning. Objects transform from their humble selves into abstract shapes discharged of meaning, or alternately into advertisements for themselves, charged with desire or bad omens of an ominous future.

""Were it not for"" is combining a 670-line text with 218 photographs of the Mojave Desert. This combination creates a powerful sense of unease throughout the document, which is exploring the idea of fear and haunting as an effect of the violent legacies contained within the landscape, and as a function of the technologies that we use to represent it""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With the immediacy of street photography, he captured their beauty in a continuous sequence of images taking place during exactly 12 hours. Focusing on the interaction of light, shadows, and architecture, the aesthetics of his stunning photographs are strict, clear, and minimalist. Regardless, these external landscapes can be read as ?internal landscapes? projected outwards. They tell a tale of fragility, loneliness, and isolation, of human existence holding out against such anonymous, concrete habitats.

My photographs are black-and-white, and shot on black-and-white film as well. I wanted to keep the whole process, from shooting and film developing to making prints, in my own hands.

A place where as many as one million starlings gather in the spring and fall, prior to onwards migration, and set the stage for one of nature's most spectacular phenomena. As the countless birds congregate in large murmurations before collectively settling in the reeds at dusk they put on an incredible show of collaboration and performance skills. And now and then, by the added drama of attacking birds of prey, the flock will unfold a breathtaking and veritable ballet of life or death. The starlings move as one unified organism that vigorously opposes any outside threat. A strong visual expression is created - like that of an ink drawing or a calligraphic brush stroke - asserting itself against the sky. Shapes and black lines of condensation form within the swarm, resembling waves of interference or mathematical abstractions written across the horizon. At times the flock seems to possess the cohesive power of super fluids, changing shape in an endless flux: From geometric to organic, from solid to fluid, from matter to ethereal, from reality to dream - an exchange in which real time ceases to exist and mythical time pervades.

In Ballester's series, absence is the recurring sign of these images; outdoors are the architectural structures or their ruins but also the helpless gestures of those who inhabited them. ""The photographer (Ballester) is there and, in an almost archaeological sense, explores the ruins to connect them with our present."".

The body forms the basis for our experience of ourselves and the world. Winkelmann has engaged in close dialogue with various bodies and investigates the extent to which the body can be represented without shame and without the viewer becoming a voyeur. She has wanted to explore the potential of the body as material and the ornamental potential of its forms. Through fragmentation and close studies the book is a search for what the undisguised and uncosmeticized body looks like.0The body has always been a political battlefield. Different ways of exercising power and ideologies tame and shape our bodies. Through photographic representation and ideals of self-realization, stereoƠtypes are produced and confirmed. Most of the bodies we see in public are sexualized and perfected; the naked body unfiltered has come to seem both alien and dangerous. Winkelmann makes us aware of this sense of shame and thus turns the focus on something as unusual as the body with no staging or sales potential.

This year, it's the turn of a Latin American country, with the choice falling on Chile. Sweden and Chile have a lot in common. Both countries are geographically elongated and located on the edge of their respective continents. Ever since the coup which led to a military dictatorship in 1973, connections between the two countries on a human level have been strong. There are still around 50,000 people of Chilean descent living in Sweden. Cultural and scientific ties between the two countries are strong. At the same time, there are of course major differences - socially, culturally and politically - as demonstrated by Chile's photographic tradition. This exhibition has been compiled by curator Christian Caujolle in collaboration with Rodrigo Gomez Rovira, artistic director of the international festival of photography in Valparaiso. It includes the work of internationally renowned photographer Sergio Larrain, as well as six other photographers. Exhibition: Landskrona Museum, Sweden (28.06.-28.10.2018).

This book provides a comprehensive survey of the Swiss photographer's output straddling the divide between art and journalism. His work in the nascent field of colour photography is also well represented."" ""Visiting southern Germany after the Second World War ended, he was appalled at the sheer scale of the destruction and set about documenting Europe in the aftermath of war. In those early days of photojournalism, Bischof had his pictures published in the leading magazines of the western world and became a founding member of the legendary Magnum Photos group."" ""Bischof's 1951 photo essay on famine in India won him international acclaim. His travels in Asia inspired a life long interest in the relationship between tradition and modernism, culminating in the photographs of Japan. Working in the war zones of Korea and Indochina, Bischof became increasingly disillusioned by photojournalism and, after two years in Asia he returned to Zurich."" ""In the autumn of 1953 he created expansively composed colour photographs in the USA. He then travelled on to Central and South America in search of harmony between man and nature. Werner Bischof was killed in a road accident in the Andes in 1954.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Todays photographers approach their craft in a multitude of ways, and with so many millions of people at it, theres a sizeable support group for every interest, from iPhoneography to expressive, humanitarian, or collaborative photography. Narrative is one such popular area, and there is a new interest in making coherent photo stories. Using Michaels own work, and that of many other great photographers, this unique book will show how classic photo stories are shot and edited, and give aspiring photojournalists and hobbyists alike a wealth of ideas to unlock the potential of their most powerful storytelling tool: their camera.

The photographer Ingo van Aaren (b. 1973; lives and works in Berlin) shadows the unequal pair on their rambles, capturing them in front of the Brandenburg Gate, on Alexanderplatz, or crossing the river on Oberbaumbrücke. They are invariably alone; the metropolis?s sights and scenes lie deserted around them. This is not the Berlin we know but instead a foray into the city?s history and present. Van Aaren?s photographs are complemented by texts by David Wagner (b.1971; lives and works in Berlin). A poetic colloquy unfolds between the almost all-knowing turtle and the writer in nocturnes about the metamorphosis that Berlin undergoes between half past three and five in the morning that make for interesting companion pieces to the sketches on the city?s dayside in Wagner?s books Welche Farbe hat Berlin and Mauer Park.0The dialogue between Ingo van Aaren?s photographs and David Wagner?s texts weaves a new form of flânerie through Berlin. With a nod to Walter Benjamin?s Arcades Project, they limn a portrait of a city in constant transformation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

'Sandcastles And Rubbish' puts its focus on the site of the port and the industrial landscape around it.  In previous projects Vanoverberghe shows statues and pillars made out of stone, ruins in desolated landscapes or nature in a constant state of transformation. For 'Sandcastles And Rubbish' a change in materiality took place, a change wherein Vanoverberghe investigates 'new' artefacts of our time. Rusted and bend steel, gravel pits, sturdy and raw structures flirt with composition and elegancy. Photographic works are presented alongside artefacts or 'objets trouvées'. Questions are raised about the value of an object and how value changes as time passes by. Vanoverberghes work is characterised by a constant flux of place and time.

As such, the book is also a personal response to the current covid pandemic. The word 'interregnum' describes a period with lack of clear leadership in a country, organisation or social order. Failed states will often be in an interregnum. Ronny Rønning explores a visual language that can represent the anxieties of living in a world seemingly out of control. The images has a reference to reality, but also contains something more ambivalent - an empty, dark, and foreboding landscape, as after the catastrophe, with only remnants of human life. As part of finding a visual language for the book, Ronny Rønning has experimented with the photo medium. He has used an analogue camera, black & white film and flash. During development the film has been exposed to light in an attempt to find a visual expression appropriate for the book's topic.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ein breites Echo fand auch seine±Reise durch den Kanton Schwyz», die er 2005 als Ergebniseines offiziellen Auftrags des Schwyzer Regierungsrates vorlegte. Die beiden Arbeiten sind Beispiele einer fast 40 Jahre währenden Fotografenlaufbahn, in der sich Linsi auf bemerkenswerte Weise treu blieb und einen unverkennbar eigenen Stil entwickelte. Die Genauigkeit und Ruhe seiner Bilder scheint den Aufnahmen auf den ersten Blick etwas Stilllebenartiges zu verleihen, und doch ist der Moment darin auf ebenso unauffällige wie suggestive Art erfaßt, daß man beim zweiten Hinsehen den Kern einer Geschichte erkennt, die längeres Nachsinnen und -sehen provoziert. Menschen und Landschaften sind die Schwerpunkte von Linsis Fotografie. Unerschütterlich vertraut er dabei dem Prinzip der Entschleunigung. In größter Bedächtigkeit pflegt er seine großformatigen Kameras aufzubauen und anschließend zu warten, bis das besondere Licht hervortritt oder die Menschen ihre Fremdheit und Befangenheit vor der Kamera ablegen.

Industrier och kommunikationer, samhällen som växer och förändras. Det nya seklet tycks innebära att allt går fortare, men nu finns också teknik som gör att tiden kan hejdas och materialiseras.Johan Emanuel Thorin var en av dem som lockades av fotografins möjligheter. Genom kameralinsen iakttog han sin omgivning naturen, bebyggelsen och människorna, det nya och det gamla. Motiven fann han ofta i Åtvidaberg, en tätort som utvecklades i snabb takt och där Thorin var verksam, inte bara som fotograf utan också som folkskollärare med många förtroendeuppdrag.Thorins gärning är unik. Den breda repertoaren, de omfattande dokumentationerna och de enskilda bildernas lyskraft och nyansrikedom väcker beundran. Hans fotografier är också sällsynt väl bevarade och finns i dag på en rad institutioner, främst i Åtvidaberg med omnejd. Nordiska museet har en betydande samling från Svenska Turistföreningen. Thorin fick redan under sin levnad uppmärksamhet och utmärkelser, men det är först nu som han har fått sin rättmätiga plats i den svenska fotohistorien.Boken Exponerad tid är resultatet av ett mångårigt forskningsarbete. Med stor kunskap lyfter författarna fram Thorins fotografi och sätter in den i ett större sammanhang. Boken är ett viktigt stycke kulturhistoria och samtidigt en skildring av en engagerad och skicklig fotograf.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Han var også en pasjonert og profesjonell fruktdyrker, med utdannelse fra Tyskland og gårdsbruk i Odda. Knudsen etablerte seg som fotograf i Bergen i 1864, og var blant de første som spesialiserte seg på landskapsfotografier. En generasjon før fotograf Anders Beer Wilse, utforsket han landet på kryss og tvers. Men Knudsen tok ikke bare bilder av landskapene, han var også dypt fascinert av veiene han reiste på. I denne boken følger vi ham på nye veier som ble bygd i andre halvdel av 1800-tallet. De omformet det norske landskapet og gjorde det tilgjengelig for turister og andre reisende.

His love for straight lines always shows, as well as the fascination for the play of shadow and light. Stillness is a key factor. Vercruysse works in a very controlled way, weighing and balancing until his image finds its equilibrium. It's almost an obsession, the way he composes and arranges his subject, how he moves things until they are completely straight. This book contains 3 sections: compositions, control, out of control. The photos in of these sections are accompagnied by a text by Jina Khayyer, in which she reflects on Vercruysse's work.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dienten Fotografien anfangs oft als Erinnerungsstützen oder direkte Vorlagen, wurde bald auf Reisen, im Atelier und im Kunstunterricht unermu?dlich fotografiert ? ernsthaft oder zum Spass ?, was Lichtbilder hervorbrachte, die sich von den Konventionen weit entfernten.0Künstler wie Friedrich von Amerling und Carl Rahl liessen eigene Entwürfe fotografieren, um sie farbig zu überarbeiten: Das vervielfältigbare Lichtbild machte aus einer Skizze den Ausgangspunkt für mehrere malerische Varianten. Auch das Malen auf eigens dafür gekauften Fotografien wiesen selbst anerkannte Meister wie Franz Alt nicht von sich. Und auch Hans Makart oder Leopold Carl Müller benutzten Fotografien ohne Scheu.

The book reveals the artist's humor, ingenuity, and ability to unearth the creative potential that ""lurks within the mundane,"" to use her words. The diverse range of art it highlights includes Mended Spiderwebs, a series of photographs documenting the artist's attempts to weave red string into dilapidated spiderwebs, and Under Pressure, a recent video that Katchadourian took of herself lip-synching to David Bowie and Freddy Mercury's duet using her mobile phone in the cramped quarters of an airplane lavatory. We learn about art projects she has made with the assistance not only of arachnids and rock stars, but also United Nations translators, birdcall experts, librarians, sports announcers, parking lot attendants, an accent elimination coach, and even her own parents. This exhibition catalogue marks the first significant publication on Katchadourian's work and features essays by Jeffrey Kastner and Veronica Roberts, as well as an interview between the artist and Stuart Horodner. In addition, it includes Katchadourian's accounts of fourteen individual works paired with creative essays from a multidisciplinary team of contributors including artist Ann Hamilton, animal behavior expert Laurel Braitman, and sound art scholar Christoph Cox. Through these diverse perspectives, readers are introduced to Katchadourian's unbridled curiosity and puckish wit""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through his photography - evocative of the work of the generation of photographers before him, including Nan Goldin, Larry Clark, and Ryan McGinley - Amato celebrates the faces of the Bronx, where he discovers the majority of his subjects. He takes their pictures. He casts them in fashion shows and advertising campaigns. He calls them 'The Importants', the young people thriving against all odds and who together exemplify diversity and inclusivity. Amato documents a new world order that is as provocative as it is tender, and as disturbing as it is joyful.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Plonsker began traveling to Cuba to uncover Havana's thriving art scene. The Light in Cuban Eyes: Lake Forest College's Madeleine P. Plonsker Collection of Contemporary Cuban Photography focuses on Cuban photography between 1992-2012. These years cover Cuba's ""Special Period,"" a desperate time resulting from the withdrawal of financial support from the former Soviet Union that continues to present day. The 50 artists who comprise this bilingual book--including Juan Carlos Alom, Adrián Fernández Milanés, Marta María Pérez Bravo, Cirenaica Moreira, and Glenda León--shoot their worlds in styles ranging from fabulist to gritty. This is world-class work, yet the artists are often known only to the small population of collectors fortunate enough to have traveled to this tightly restricted country, or through art world reputations that have only recently started to expand beyond the island. Lake Forest College's Madeleine P. Plonsker Collection of Contemporary Cuban Photography is composed of 170 pieces; The Light in Cuban Eyes is the first North American publication with support from the Cuban Ministry of Culture and Fototeca de Cuba, Cuba's repository of photography comparable in function to the Smithsonian Photography Department in Washington, D.C."" -- Publisher's description.

Hartmann is one of very few Western photographers who has been allowed almost full access to the country. This publication is the result of many years of research and four visits to Pyongyang. After the total destruction of Pyongyang during the Korean War (1950-53), the government took its chance to rebuild the capital from scratch and to turn it into the perfect setting for their propaganda. Pyongyang was to become the city in which every North Korean could experience true modern socialism. The buildings were to be the utopian background against which the inhabitants could live their daily lives. Pyongyang was to immortalise the socialist revolution. Eddo Hartmann had the exceptional opportunity to photograph this architecture of artificiality. In a series of evocative images, he captures the forced and almost surreal character of North Korean ambition. In a very personal and original style, Hartmann focuses on the individual.

Selected from photographs taken during the Webbs's nearly 30-year friendship and later marriage and creative partnership, this group of 80 photographs are paired--one by Alex, one by Rebecca--to create a series of visual rhymes that talk to one another--often at a ""slant"" and in intriguing and revealing ways. ""Sometimes we find our photographic slant rhymes share a similar palette or tone or geometry,"" writes Alex Webb in the introduction to the book. ""Other times, our paired photographs strike a similar note--often a penchant for surreal or surprising or enigmatic moments--although often in two different keys."" These photographs, most of which are published here for the first time, are interwoven with short text pieces by Rebecca Norris Webb. The result is an unfinished love poem, told at a slant.

With its electronic viewfinder and interchangeable lenses, the GH2 is capable of not only recording professional-quality still images, but has the added ability to record HD video as well.

It is smaller than a typical DSLR in both size and weight, and retains automatic focusing while recording videos capability that is missing in many DSLR cameras.  With the GH2, Panasonic has significantly expanded the video capabilities beyond those of previous models. Among the improvements is the ability to adjust the frame rate and shutter speed when filming video, giving users greater control over the movie-making process.  In this guide, authors Brian Matsumoto and Carol F. Roullard explore and explain the features and capabilities of the GH2 camera in detail, as they cover everything from the basic features of the camera to numerous advanced photographic applications. The informative text is illustrated with example images throughout.  Readers will learn how to:  Control the most basic camera functions-focus and exposure   Navigate the camera's menu system   Achieve a range of artistic effects using various camera settings   Use the camera's automated controls, and override those controls to obtain better exposure   Use the GH2 in its video mode to obtain HD videos   Post-process images and videos on a computer   Expand the camera's use by mounting it on a telescope or microscope    And much more..""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Displaying a dazzling array of fine art and material culture, Made in California challenges us to reexamine the ways in which the state has been portrayed and imagined. Unusually inclusive, visually intriguing, and beautifully produced, this volume is a delight throughout--both in image and in text--and will appeal to anyone who has lived in, visited, or imagined California.  Drawn from the exhibition, which gathers more than 1,200 artworks and pieces of ephemera from many public and private collections, Made in California is an image-driven look at the past century, featuring more than 400 works in a range of media, from painting, sculpture, prints, drawings, and photographs to furniture, fashion, and film. The book also includes more than 150 cultural artifacts such as tourist brochures, posters, labor union tracts, personal letters, and government reports that convey the richness and complexity of twentieth-century California. Arranged provocatively by theme, these objects take us on a visual tour of a state that was promoted as a bountiful paradise early in the century as a glamour capital by Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s as a suburban utopia in the late '40s and '50s as a haven for counterculture in the '60s and '70s, and as a multicultural frontier in the '80s and '90s. The book's exploration of how these themes were reflected and contested in California's visual culture deepens our understanding of the state's artistic traditions as well as its fascinating history.  The volume is divided into five twenty-year sections, each including a narrative essay discussing the history of that era and highlighting topics particularly relevant to its visual culture. Two overarching themes emerge that have been crucial for how we imagine and understand California: first, the landscape, including both the natural and built environment, and second, the multifaceted relationships California has had with Latin America and Asia.     Geographer Michael Dear has contributed a sweeping overview of the social history of California that examines the vibrant and sometimes turbulent conditions out of which the culture emerged. Essayist Richard Rodriguez closes the volume with a uniquely personal meditation on the Golden State.

The second journey, Châteaux disparus, maps six vanished castles around Paris. And the third guides us through a foggy Malmö where each captured view has been selected by the principle of the polaroid technique (it takes three minutes between an image in color and one in black-and-white).""--Publisher's website.

This richly illustrated publication seeks to highlight and acknowledge these aspects of her work based on selected examples and accompanied by texts by well-known authors, filmmakers, and artists who likewise deal with the grotesque, the uncanny, and the extraordinary in their artistic practice.""--Publisher's website.

Levon Biss's photographs capture in breathtaking detail the beauty of the insect world and are printed in large-scale format to provide an unforgettable viewing experience. Each picture in Microsculpture is created from approximately 8,000 individual photographs. Segments of the specimen are lit and photographed separately using microscope lenses, then stacked to maintain sharp focus throughout. These images are then combined to create a single high-resolution file. From start to finish, each portrait takes approximately 4 weeks to create. The project has captured the attention of the world with features in WIRED and New Scientist. Microsculpture has been exhibited at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and the Xposure 2016 International Photography Festival in Sharjah, U.A.E. It has been viewed by over half a mil-lion people so far and will be touring museums around the world from 2017 onward.""--Publisher.

It is a meeting of worlds. An encounter between curved, nude female bodies with avant-garde, anthropomorphic sculptures. Their shape refers back to the bodies. Vivier confronts roughness with sensuality. She creates her own world, which feels absurd, uncanny and touches the strangeness in ordinary things. Femininity is shown, but in a more abstract and gentle way than we are used to. Twist faces us with voluptuous, straightforward, sensual and yet surreal bodies and sculptures which swallow our gaze.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His enigmatic yet beautiful repetitions of straight chalk lines, drawn using a spirit level on walls, buildings, stairways, and sidewalks, are a fleeting testament to the challenges and interactions the artist experiences during his working process. In 2010 and 2013, Lodewijks spent some months in Rio de Janeiro, searching for suitable locations for his drawings. Local residents led him to places that were scenes of everyday life, mundane yet with a special character. Much of the time he frequented a small favela, about which he has written a story relating the life he discovered there.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The chronological series begins in 1936, when a 16 year old girl from Tilburg in Holland picks up a gun and shoots at the target in a shooting gallery. Every time she hits the target, it triggers the shutter of a camera and a portrait of the girl in firing pose is taken and given as a prize. And so a lifelong love affair with the shooting gallery begins. This series documents almost every year of the woman's life (there is a conspicuous pause from 1939 to 1945) up until present times.

Taken at various impersonator conventions and stage shows throughout North America, the photographs are both startling and poignant—for all of the frivolity and double takes (""Isn't that Paris Hilton?"") there is also a sense of the real person beneath the makeup and the artifice. Accompanying the portraits are first-person narratives by many of the subjects, many of whom feel personally close to those they are impersonating, even if they have never met them. In addition, in two essays, cultural critic Norbert Ruebsaat looks at the history of celebrity culture, and Geist magazine editor Stephen Osborne delves into the nature of photographing impersonators. As such, the book investigates the nature of fame in this era of celebrity blogs, stalkerazzi, and reality television—and how our obsession with famous people says as much about us as it does about them.

Legendary rock and roll photographer Bob Gruen was welcomed into the lives of John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their years in New York City, when Gruen served as their personal lensman, and he continues to document Yoko today. Approached by his friend Jody Denberg, an Austin rock radio mainstay who had logged twenty-five years of interviews with Yoko, Gruen collaborated with him to create an extraordinary birthday gift. In this breathtaking volume, Gruen has selected more than three hundred classic color and black-and-white photographs'accompanied by text of Yoko's insights gleaned from Denberg's many hours of interviews'to illuminate the intimate story of Yoko Ono at the height of her fame as a woman, wife, mother, and avant-garde artist who keeps creating because, as she notes, ""that's who I am."" Yoko's role as a peace activist and artist underscores the enduring legacy of the era. See Hear Yoko reveals a modern woman in love, in ascension, in grief, in joy, and in peace. Lavish and beautiful, mirroring the deeply personal design of the original volume given to Yoko herself, See Hear Yoko brings into focus an extraordinary woman, and one of the most memorable periods in modern history.

Their ranks far outnumber professional astronomers doing the same and their contributions both technically and artistically are the dominant drivers of progress in the field today. This book is a unique collaboration of individuals, all world-renowned in their particular area, and covers in detail each of the major sub-disciplines of astrophotography. This approach offers the reader the greatest opportunity to learn the most current information and the latest techniques directly from the foremost innovators in the field today. The book as a whole covers all types of astronomical image processing, including processing of eclipses and solar phenomena, extracting detail from deep-sky, planetary, and widefield images, and offers solutions to some of the most challenging and vexing problems in astronomical image processing. Recognized chapter authors include deep sky experts such as JAY GABANY, TONY HALLAS, ROBERT GENDLER, KEN CRAWFORD, high-resolution planetary expert DAMIAN PEACH, and the founder of The World at Night BABAK A. TAFRESHI, among other luminaries in the field of astronomical image processing. A large number of quality illustrations help explain the critical concepts and complex techniques the modern astrophotographer will need to achieve the highest level of quality in their astronomical images.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Fotografía artística Guerra,Pedro A. Guerra,photography,First published in 2017,/works/OL32583764W,/authors/OL639541A/Pedro_A._Guerra,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Cámara de Diputados, LXIII Legislatura|Language Spanish|Pages 316","Pedro Guerra, father and son, recorded life in the Yucatán state from 1877 to 1959; its 500 thousand negatives give rise to this book. Pedro Guerra Jordán and Pedro Guerra Aguilar, father and son, chronicle Yucatan from the late nineteenth century and until the middle of the twentieth century. From his studio Guerra Art Photography, whose collection has been protected at the Autonomous University of Yucatan (UADY) since 1977, the two chroniclers made the portrait of an era, built through around 500 thousand negatives and visual documents ""a social and cultural picture about the Yucatan Peninsula"", as they claim, as a prologue, José Antonio Rodríguez and Alberto Tovalín Ahumada, editors of the book Fotografía Artística Guerra, which is published within the framework of the 40th anniversary of the Pedro Guerra Photo Library. ""Without a doubt, the Pedro Guerra archive contributes with other collections from Mexico to visually build the national history, and the fact that the Autonomous University of Yucatan has hosted this collection and preserved it and then enriched it, including with donations from other photographers and from other collectors, it is a wonder because it documents the history of the 19th and 20th century of Yucatan and even of the Peninsula,"" says the historian and anthropologist Blanca González Rodríguez Ten scholars also participate in the book analyzing the vital issues in the Guerra archive: The Study, Cotidians, Henequen, Vestiges, Rituals and Politics. Edward Jimmy Montañez, who worked for 32 years at the Fototeca Pedro Guerra, points out that father and son were undoubtedly the most important photographers not only from Yucatan but even from all of the southeast of the country. ""In almost 100 years of photographic production we will find that they portrayed Yucatec society as a whole, we can see portraits of both the upper social class, entrepreneurs, Yucatecan hacienda owners, governors, municipal presidents and in the same way portrayed peasants and workers; and the quality will not decrease because it is a social class or another."" The editor Alberto Tovalín Ahumada says that there is a lot of material in the Guerra archive, so they decided to make a selection and focus on six themes that range from his portraits in the studio - which survived until 1975 in charge of a nephew of Pedro Guerra Aguilar - to images about daily life, haciendas of the henequen, archaeological remains, politics and rituals such as parties and the photography of the dead. ""We were able to select the most representative themes, for example, politics, where the first feminist Congress is interesting, that is, the role of women in the political life of Yucatan that was impressive; the era of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, de Madero, Pino Suárez and Serapio Rendón. There is a very beautiful picture in the theater during the feminist congress,"" says Tovalín Ahumada.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Authors Carol F. Roullard and Brian Matsumoto team up to help the new user navigate past the confusion factor that often comes with complex and powerful camera equipment.  This book explores the features and capabilities of the camera in a way that far surpasses the user's manual. It guides you through the camera features with step-by-step setting adjustments and detailed how, when, and why explanations for each option. Every button, dial, switch, and menu configuration setting is explored in a friendly manner, with suggestions and tips for setup according to various shooting styles. The informative text is illustrated with screenshots and example images throughout, making it easy to follow along.  The authors cover everything from the basic features of the camera to numerous advanced photographic applications. The first section of the book teaches the new user to start taking pictures immediately by using the camera's Intelligent Automatic mode. The second section covers how to begin taking more control by switching to the semi-automatic modes. Finally, you'll learn to take full manual control of the camera, allowing you to break some ""rules"" and capture images that are a unique reflection of your creative personality.  Carol and Brian go beyond just the camera itself and share how third-party software and optional accessories can improve on the camera's standard commands. You'll even learn how the electronic viewfinder, the fixed mirror, and Sony's novel shutter design improve the camera's utility for critical scientific photography (i.e., photomicrography and photography through the telescope).  The Sony Alpha NEX-7: The Unofficial Quintessential Guide will allow you to really take control of your camera, to push the envelope, and to have fun""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Many of these pioneers were immigrants - people displaced by choice or, quite often, by necessity. These photographers became observers and interpreters of their new surroundings through the filters of their different cultures, languages and religions. Photography in the 20th century (particularly the Modernist vision) is deeply indebted to them. Displaced Visions reconsiders the work and influence of key figures in modernist photography from the point of view of their status as immigrants, considering how this condition affected their vision and creativity and enhanced the development of the photographic language in general.

She has traveled throughout Brazil and more than 40 countries, always observing and recording peculiar images. Held her first solo exhibition in 2015. She began shooting with a drone as soon as the first photographic drones appeared in Brazil and specialized in this aerial drone photography. The book shows a different ""sertão"" from what we're used to seeing. Lu Brito brings in her second book a hinterland in the rainy season. A backcountry with water and full of richness and exuberance. Contrary to what we may think, the hinterland has a rich beauty and full of colors at this time of year. In addition, the photographer brings in her work an unusual look: aerial photography with a zenital drone - perpendicular - that shows us the textures, colors, geography, and geometry of one of the most captivating the Northeast regions of Brazil.

Imitating the manner of film stills, Lai is recreating a succession of characters in dramatic and occasional horror situations that hint at stories. Deliberately ambiguous, he engages the viewer by inviting individual interpretation.00Initially, the series was formed in Paris, France by photographing friends in the neighbourhood and in studios with the use of basic props. Gradually it widened to various outdoor locations in countries such as Japan, China and Hong Kong, by envisioning an extended range of characters and contexts. Throughout, fashion belongings from the 1960s to 1980s were utilised styles linked to low budget Japanese horror films from the 70s, as well as Pinku eiga [Pink film], erotic Japanese movies from the 60s which were exclusively shot on 35mm film. These films dominated Japanese domestic cinema through the mid-1980s due to their high production value and talent. Lai's intention was to engender atmospheric images in unidentifiable locations as if they were taken decades ago, acclaiming the women within these critical and popular films. Showa, a 62-year period within Japanese history, can be translated as 'the era of enlightened peace,' but it can also mean 'the era of Japanese glory.'

Indem sie in einem immerwährenden Prozess des Überschreibens und Ummodellierens das fotografische Bild aus seinem reproduzierenden Sinnzusammenhang löst und zu einem dreidimensionalen autonomen Objekt werden lässt, negiert sie das Ontologische der Fotografie und konfrontiert die BetrachterInnen gleichzeitig mit einem uralten Topos der Kunstgeschichte: der Illusion. In Fesers auf Fotografie basierenden Arbeiten überlagern sich verschiedene Zustände und Seinsweisen des Fotografischen. Sie schwanken zwischen Illusion und Realität und bilden dabei Quasimomente der Sichtbarkeit ab. 0Exhibition: Kunstverein Gera e.V., Gera, Germany (26.08. - 8.10.2016).

The black and white photographs created in the darkroom at his Copenhagen studio have that certain quality, something ancient that reminds us of our centuries-long rural roots.

The silver grains in the film base of the photograph can easily be experienced on the outside of the pages, as the traces of the digital ones and zeroes in the hyper-digital version are almost inaccessible on the inside of the folded pages. To form a third layer, these two images are impossible to see in their complete state, the pages show only cuts. What is visible is a 100% reproduction, cropped by the size of the book page. By showing two different representations of the same photograph in this way, the artist wants to match his working process and the experiences from engaging with the book as medium. It is in the tension between either or and both that the book is formed, a space where Betshammar likes to work. 'However, Despite the Haze You Can Still Get a Concrete Feeling for the Surroundings' is a book that wants to encourage resistance and raise questions about the idea of the photobook itself - what and who creates it, and how readers respond.

The seeds of the project were planted in the 1990s, when the photographer Marilène Coolens was taking snapshots of her growing daughter and had her play out scenes from cartoons, fairy tales and TV shows, in the hope of stimulating little Lisa's imagination. The result was an intimate family archive of analogue photographs, which memymom later collected under the title 'The Umbilical Vein'. As the daughter grew up, however, the roles began to shift: Lisa became photographer and model, set dresser and director all at once. And Marilène too extended her role and began to appear in the images herself. In the process, they evolved into an artist duo, with the two women now on an equal footing. Memymom's photographs are sensitive images with strong references to theatre and film. Past and present blend in pictures that continue to refer to childhood, but in which youthful innocence has given way to sensuality.

It's not a linear one, neither a chronological one. It is an intertwining story where the past and the present try to connect with each other as well as disconnect. My identity is deeply influenced by my mother and how she has raised me. When looking in a mirror I see my mother staring back at me. While embracing these similarities, there still runs a fear through me of repeating similar choices. This path of finding my own identity has lead met to Chicago, the place where I was born. By using the archive of my mother when she was my age, I try to deceive the viewer into thinking we are one person. This feeling even gets reinforced in the similarity of the style and the people we choose to surround us with. In the meanwhile my grandmothers' voice echoes throughout the book in the form of questions right before she died. My grandmother and mother shared also this almost identical relationship as I do with my mother.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die Familie Rothschild fand sich ebenso ein wie Coco Chanel oder Josephine Baker, Marc Chagall oder Maurice Chevalier. Vom Ruhm einer erfolgreichen Modefotografin in Wien und Paris war es jedoch nur ein Schritt zur Mittellosigkeit einer entrechteten Jüdin im Versteck vor der Verfolgung durch deutsche Besatzungssoldaten in Frankreich. Gerade noch davongekommen, richtete die Gesellschaftsporträtistin nach 1945 ihren zugleich scharfen und einfühlsamen Blick auch auf namenlose Heimkehrer aus Konzentrationslagern und auf das Schlachtvieh der Pariser Hallen. Dora Kallmus' Porträts erzählen eindrucksvoll von den schillernden Höhen und grausamen Tiefen des 20.

Everyone should be treated equally - able-bodied and disabled. Still, it is not the top athletes with gold in the Paralympics who get the most attention. Photographer Arnfinn Johnsen has portrayed our gold medal winners and interviewed them about their struggle, challenges and sporting achievements. 82 of these portraits are collected in this book. One can read about incredible lives with adversity and trials, but also about strength, endurance, joy and not least- talent. These athletes deserve to be lifted up for inspiration for all. ""Had I had a time machine, I would not have gone beyond the high voltage. I do not want the Armenian back, I want to be in this strange world. It is much more adventurous and exciting, and has its own identity."" -Cato Zahl Pedersen  'Idrettsglede for alle' er slagordet i norsk idrett.

Fotograf Arnfinn Johnsen har portrettert våre gullmedaljevinnere og intervjuet dem om deres kamp, utfordringer og sportslige prestasjoner. 82 av disse portrettene er samlet i denne boken. Man kan lese om utrolige liv med motgang og prøvelser, men også om styrke, utholdenhet, glede og ikke minst - talent. Disse idrettsutøverne fortjener å bli løftet frem til inspirasjon for alle.

The series has explored all the major aspects of photography: the technology of equipment; the techniques of taking pictures, developing film and making prints; photographic history; and the esthetics of photography as an art form.  Each volume in the series is complete in itself and can stand alone. But because many of the subjects treated have different application, some of them occur in more than one book. Aerial photography, for instance, receives its major emphasis in Photography as a Tool, but also appears in The Camera and again in Travel Photography. To make all of the information in all of the books quickly and easily available in one place, the indexes of the 17 volumes have been collated to form the comprehensive index.

And yet, theres still something magical for those of us who recall waiting for a Polaroid picture to develop. Writing in the context of two Polaroid Corporation bankruptcies, not to mention the obsolescence of its film, Peter Buse argues that Polaroid was, and is, distinguished by its process--by the fact that, as the New York Times put it in 1947, ""the camera does the rest."" Polaroid was often dismissed as a toy, but Buse takes it seriously, showing how it encouraged photographic play as well as new forms of artistic practice. Drawing on unprecedented access to the archives of the Polaroid Corporation, Buse reveals Polaroid as photography at its most intimate, where the photographer, photograph, and subject sit in close proximity in both time and spacemaking Polaroid not only the perfect party camera but also the tool for frankly salacious pictures taking. Along the way, Buse tells the story of the Polaroid Corporation and its ultimately doomed hard-copy wager against the rising tide of digital imaging technology. He explores the continuities and the differences between Polaroid and digital, reflecting on what Polaroid can tell us about how we snap photos today. Richly illustrated, The Camera Does the Rest will delight historians, art critics, analog fanatics, photographers, and all those who miss the thrill of waiting to see what develops.--Publisher description.

The new West,Robert Adams,photography,First published in 2015,/works/OL20007099W,/authors/OL25655A/Robert_Adams,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 133,"The open American West is nearly gone. The New West is a photographic essay about what came to fill it-freeways, tract homes, low-rise business buildings and signs. In five sequences of pictures taken along the front wall of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Robert Adams has documented a representative sampling of the whole suburban Southwest. These views have a double power. At first they shock; normally we try to forget the commercial squalor they depict. Slowly, however, they reveal aspects of the geography-the shape of the land itself, for example-that are beyond man's harm. Adams has written that ""all land, no matter what has happened to it, has over it a grace, an absolutely persistent beauty,"" and his photographs show this. Originally published in 1974, The New West is now regarded as a classic, standing alongside Walker Evans's American Photographs and Robert Frank's The Americans in the pantheon of landmark volumes of photography exploring American culture and society. This new edition marks the book's fortieth anniversary and the beginning of a long-term commitment by Steidl to publish the full extent Robert Adams's remarkable body of work  Originally published in 1974, this book is now regarded as a classic book of photography in the pantheon of landmark projects exploring American culture and society.

Starting from his earliest photographic searchings, it shows the foundations of Goldblatt's critical passion for photography, his social sensitivity and political consciousness. Also to see are his most recent photographs, always in tight relation to the changing situation in South Africa, his native country. Structures of Dominion and Democracy assembles many of Goldblatt's influential series including ""On the Mines,"" ""Some Afrikaners"" and ""Structures"" with some less well-known including ""Kas Maine,"" and reconstructs the history of their first publication in the international press. Reproducing original handmade dummies and working plates, the process of bookmaking and other diverse applications of these often iconic images are laid bare. In addition to texts by the photographer, essays by Ivor Powell and Karolina Ziebinska-Lewandowska explore Goldblatt's work in the context of South African political and cultural history, as well as his contribution to the wider history of photography.

Light painting is a classic photography technique that involves selectively illuminating sections of a dark subject by moving a light source (like a flashlight) over the subject during the course of a seconds- or minutes-long exposure. This results in uniquely nuanced depictions with a high level of technical artistry. As Eric Curry shows, however, today's hardware and software allow you to produce light-painting images that are anything but traditional! In this book, you'll learn, step by step, how to plan and execute incredible, nuanced images using simple gear, a whole lot of imagination, and today's powerful postproduction software. With these techniques, your imagination is the only limit to what you can create!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Her series ""Earthworks"" (abandoned rooms filled with sand) and ""Sunken Gardens"" (an overgrown butterfly farm in the jungle) even approach a kind of claustrophobic serenity in their closeness and sense of intrusion. Similarly, ""Kudzu Project"" portrays another kind of suffocation, wherein she turns her lens on the overwhelming tendencies of a specific plant.
