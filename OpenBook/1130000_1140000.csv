THE LAST DAYS OF NEW YORK: a reporter's true tale,Seth Barron,political_science,First published in 2021,/works/OL24777466W,/authors/OL9344710A/Seth_Barron,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32904767M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 1, 2021|Publisher  Humanix Books|Language English|Pages 304","BILL DE BLASIO SET THE STAGE FOR THE RUIN OF NEW YORK CITY    THE LAST DAYS OF NEW YORK: a reporter's true tale tells the story of how a corrupted political system hollowed out New York City, leaving it especially vulnerable, all in the name of equity and “fairness.”  When, in the future, people ask how New York City fell to pieces, they can be told—quoting Hemingway—“gradually, then suddenly.” New Yorkers awoke from a slumber of ease and prosperity to discover that their glorious city was not only unprepared for crisis, but that the underpinnings of its fortune had been gutted by the reckless mismanagement of Bill de Blasio and the progressive political machine that elevated him to power.  Faced with a global pandemic of world-historical proportions, the mayor dithered, offering contradictory, unscientific, and meaningless advice. The city became the world’s epicenter of infection and death. The protests, riots, and looting that followed the death of George Floyd, and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement—cheered on and celebrated by the media and political class—accelerated the crash of confidence that New York City needed in order to rebound quickly from the economic disaster.  Through reckless financial husbandry; by sowing racial discord and resentment; by enshrining a corrosive pay-to-play political culture that turned City Hall into a ticket office; and by using his office as a platform to advance himself as a national political figure, Bill de Blasio set the stage for the ruin of New York City.  As New Yorkers slowly adjust to their new reality, they ask themselves how we had been so unprepared—not so much for the coronavirus, which caught everyone by surprise—but for the economic shock, which was at least foreseeable. THE LAST DAYS OF NEW YORK is the story of how a lifelong political operative with no private-sector experience assumed control of a one-party city where almost nobody bothers to vote, and then proceeded to loot the treasury on behalf of the labor unions, race hustlers, and connected insiders who had promoted him to power.  Bill de Blasio’s failure to manage the outbreak of Covid-19 is well established. But what is less well understood is how poorly he managed the city up to the point of the pandemic, and how his mismanagement left New York City vulnerable to the social, economic, and cultural shocks that have leveled its confidence and brought into question its capacity to absorb the creative energies of the world, and reflect them back in the form of opportunity and wealth, as it has done for hundreds of years. At a moment when socialist currents are stirring throughout America, Bill de Blasio’s term in office in New York City is a demonstration of what those impulses actually produce: debt, decay, and bloat.  THE LAST DAYS OF NEW YORK: a reporter's true tale is a history of New York City from its recovery from the recession of 2008-2009 through the triple disaster of the pandemic, civil unrest, and collapse in revenue of 2020. Mayor Bill de Blasio, now widely appreciated as the WORST mayor in the history of the city, is presented as the instrument of decline: a key symptom of the rot that expedited the city’s downfall.

Eine Ausnahme stellt Argentinien dar: Dort stehen Arbeitsmarktreformen seit dem Beginn der 1990er Jahre auf der politischen Agenda – nicht weniger als fünf Reformen wurden bisher verabschiedet. Diese Arbeit bietet sowohl für den Erfolg als auch für das Scheitern von Reformen eine Erklärung, die auf den Kräfteverhältnissen der jeweiligen Interessengruppen basiert. Vor diesem Hintergrund stehen die folgenden Fragen im Mittelpunkt: Welche gesellschaftlichen Gruppen bedrohen den Erfolg von Arbeitsmarktreformen? Welche Faktoren erhöhen die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass gesellschaftlicher Widerstand Reformen des Arbeitsmarktes verhindert? Und vor allem: Welche Reformmaßnahmen sind besonders schwer durchsetzbar?

Second, it elaborates on theories that grant revolt and revolution a central place in their structure.

In this collection of articles revised for book format, the Durants expertly draw out themes, issues, problems, and prospects in their preface and section introductions. Bulleted lessons and practical take-aways are also added for the busy practitioner and researcher. This book is a 'one stop shop' for cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and cross-professional exchanges on contemporary challenges, choices, and opportunities facing public administrators today""--  ""Preface Theory to Practice Advancing the ""science, processes, and art of public administration"" has long been a central animating purpose of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA). Such a mission today involves practitioners and scholars providing answers to what is arguably the central animating question facing societies worldwide: how, when, and with what implications for the values treasured in a democratic republic can we best harness for public purposes the dynamism of markets, the passion and commitment of nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations, and the public interest-oriented expertise of the career public service at all levels of government. But dialogue between practitioners and academics has increasingly become the exception rather than the rule in contemporary public administration circles. With this set of challenges in mind, the then-new PAR editor Richard Stillman and managing editor Jos Raadschelders generously asked me to develop a feature for the journal that would be tailored to the information needs of practitioners while simultaneously affording scholars state-of-the-art summaries of the status of current research. As such, my interrelated aims as editor of Theory to Practice (T2P) were fourfold: ?? Afford opportunities for academics, practitioners, and pracademics to inform each other's work in the hope of advancing both practice and theory building in public administration ?? Facilitate cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral (public, private, and nonprofit), and cross-professional exchanges that break down contemporary tendencies toward fragmentation and ""stovepiping"" of knowledge applicable to both practice and theory ??""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The only means of escape from that dire condition is to found the commonwealth, with its notorious sovereign. Hobbes invests the sovereign with virtually absolute power over the poor subjects of the commonwealth, and that vast and unlimited sovereign has drawn the reader's eye for 350 years. Yet Hobbes has a great deal to say about subjects in a commonwealth as well, and he articulates a normative conception of a good subject. This book develops a novel interpretation of the role of submission in Leviathan, and it introduces the concept of subjection to explain the expectations Hobbes has for good subjects""--Back cover.

Campaign finance and political polarization,Raymond J.

Yet, as Raymond J. La Raja and Brian F. Schaffner argue, reforms aimed at cutting the flow of money into politics have unintentionally favored candidates with extreme ideological agendas and, consequently, fostered political polarization. Drawing on data from 50 states and the U.S. Congress over 20 years, La Raja and Schaffner reveal that current rules allow wealthy ideological groups and donors to dominate the financing of political campaigns. In order to attract funding, candidates take uncompromising positions on key issues and, if elected, take their partisan views into the legislature. As a remedy, the authors propose that additional campaign money be channeled through party organizations - rather than directly to candidates - because these organizations tend to be less ideological than the activists who now provide the lion's share of money to political candidates. Shifting campaign finance to parties would ease polarization by reducing the influence of 'purist' donors with their rigid policy stances. La Raja and Schaffner conclude the book with policy recommendations for campaign finance in the United States. They are among the few non-libertarians who argue that less regulation, particularly for political parties, may in fact improve the democratic process.""--Publisher description.

The scope and size of their protests, rallies, and boycotts made these the most significant events of political activism in the United States since the 1960s. This accessibly written volume offers the first comprehensive analysis of this historic moment. Perfect for students and general readers, its essays, written by a multidisciplinary group of scholars and grassroots organizers, trace the evolution and legacy of the 2006 protest movement in engaging, theoretically informed discussions. The contributors cover topics including unions, churches, the media, immigrant organizations, and immigrant politics""--Provided by publisher.  ""From Anchorage, Alaska to Miami, Florida, millions of immigrants and their supporters took to the streets to rally for immigrant rights in the spring of 2006. The size and scope of their protests rivaled celebrated demonstrations from earlier decades for workers' rights, civil rights, or the end of war. Why and how did the immigrant rights' protests occur? Why did they end so abruptly? What is their legacy? This book is the first to address these questions by bringing together a broad, multidisciplinary account of the immigration rights rallies, protests, and boycotts of spring 2006. Drawing on top academics in the fields of sociology, political science, and Latino studies, as well as those involved with grassroots organizing and public policy debates, this volume covers the antecedents, evolution, and legacy of the 2006 protests, including discussions of unions, churches, media, immigrant organizations, and the landscape of immigration politics in the United States. More than one in eight U.S. residents were born outside the country in 2006, but lack of citizenship silences the political voice of the majority of these people through the ballot box. The peaceful demonstrations of 2006 highlight an alternative way immigrants can make their voices heard""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Cohen,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL20029879W?edition=ia%3Acurrencypowerund0000cohe,/authors/OL124131A/Benjamin_J._Cohen,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27209926M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Princeton University Press|Language English|Pages 286,"""Monetary rivalry is a fact of life in the world economy.  Intense competition between international currencies like the US dollar, Europe's euro, and the Chinese yuan is profoundly political, going to the heart of the global balance of power.  But what exactly is the relationship between currency and power, and what does it portend for the geopolitical standing of the United States, Europe, and China?  Popular opinion holds that the days of the dollar, long the world's dominant currency, are numbered.  By contrast, Currency Power argues that the current monetary rivalry still greatly favors America's greenback.  Benjamin Cohen shows why neither the euro nor the yuan will supplant the dollar at the top of the global currency hierarchy.  Cohen presents an innovative analysis of currency power and emphasizes the importance of separating out the various roles that international money might have.  After systematically exploring the links between currency internationalization and state power, Cohen turns to the state of play among today's top currencies.  The greenback, he contends, is the ""indispensable currency""--the one that the world can't do without.  Only the dollar is backed by all the economic and political resources that make a currency powerful.  Meanwhile, the euro is severely handicapped by structural defects in the design of its governance mechanisms, and the yuan suffers from various practical limitations in both finance and politics.  Contrary to today's growing opinion, Currency Power demonstrates that the dollar will continue to be the leading global currency for some time to come."" --Jacket flap.

Valeria Manzano demonstrates how, during this period, large numbers of youths built on their history of earlier activism and pushed forward closely linked agendas of sociocultural modernization and political radicalization. Focusing also on the views of adults who assessed, and sometimes profited from, youth culture, Manzano analyzes countercultural formations--including rock music, sexuality, student life, and communal living experiences--and situates them in an international context. She details how, while Argentines of all ages yearned for newness and change, it was young people who championed the transformation of deep-seated traditions of social, cultural, and political life. The significance of youth was not lost on the leaders of the rising junta: people aged sixteen to thirty accounted for 70 percent of the estimated 20,000 Argentines who were ""disappeared"" during the regime.

Acceptable to both modernists as well as Islamists, Shari'ati's radicalism inspired much of the resistance in urban Iran in the closing years of the Shah. Ali Shari'ati and the Shaping of Political Islam in Iran tells the story of how Shari'ati developed a language of political Islam, speaking in an idiom intelligible to the Iranian public, and subverting the Shah's regime and its claim to legitimacy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Using process-oriented approaches, the authors explore what happens when conscious efforts at statebuilding 'meet' social contexts, and are transformed into daily routines. In order to explain their findings, they also analyse the temporally and spatially broader structures of world society which shape the possibilities of statebuilding. Statebuilding and State Formation includes a variety of case studies from post-conflict societies in Africa, Asia and Europe, as well as the headquarters and branch offices of international agencies. Drawing on various theoretical approaches from sociology and anthropology, the contributors discuss external interventions as well as self-led statebuilding projects. This edited volume is divided into three parts: - Part I: State Formation, Violence and Political Economy - Part II: Governance, Legitimacy and Practice in Statebuilding and State-Formation - Part III: The International Self - Statebuilders' Institutional Logics, Social Backgrounds and Subjectivities The book will be of great interest to students of statebuilding and intervention, war and conflict studies, international security and IR""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through a close reading of both the acknowledged grand strategists as well as the more non-conformist foreign policy analysts, Anderson charts the entwined historical development of America's imperial reach and its role as the general guarantor of capital. The tensions between these are traced from the closing stages of the Second World War through the Cold War to the War on Terror. Despite the defeat of the USSR, Anderson shows that the planetary structures for warfare and surveillance have not been retracted but extended.

The title ?Austrian Studies Today,? then, attempts to reflect the state of the art of historical and social science related studies of Austria over the past century, without claiming to be comprehensive. The volume thus covers many important themes of Austrian contemporary history and politics since the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy in     1918?from World War I and its legacies, to the rise of authoritarian regimes in the 1930s and 1940s, to the reconstruction of republican Austria after World War II, the years of Grand Coalition governments and the Kreisky era, all the way to Austria joining the European Union in 1995 and its impact on Austria?s international status and domestic     politics.""

The author explores the micro-dynamics of symbolic power and the extent to which the regime uses rituals of power to create a political culture conducive to the monarchy's supremacy in the socio-political realm, thus promoting regime stability in Morocco. These rituals have been institutionalized in the political system and have become part of the political discourse in Morocco. The monarchy's religious authority and its use of rituals of power impede the ability of Islamist and other opposition groups to mobilize and to penetrate Moroccan society. The prevalence of this cultural and social hegemony contributes to the stability and resilience of the monarchical authoritarian regime in Morocco""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

De la laïcité à l'austérité, les débats politiques sont vigoureux. S'il y a un constat, toutefois, qui rallie les citoyens par-­delà leurs orientations idéologiques, c'est bien que notre discussion démocratique est mal en point. Rares sont ceux qui considèrent que la démocratie parlementaire et les campagnes électorales permettent de véritables débats d'idées. L'Internet 2.0 favorise la multiplication des voix, mais encourage au passage la polémique, l'indignation permanente, le trollage et l'attaque personnelle. Même les médias plus sérieux préfèrent parfois l'affrontement entre points de vue fortement idéologiques au dialogue nuancé entre des intervenants qui reconnaissent la complexité du réel. En plus, les sciences cognitives attestent que nous avons tous des partis pris qui peuvent nous empêcher d'appréhender la réalité sociale avec l'ouverture d'esprit nécessaire à la pensée rationnelle. Comment retrouver la raison ? Dans ce recueil de courts essais, Jocelyn Maclure réfléchit aux conditions d'une conversation démocratique éclairée tout en contribuant à une meilleure compréhension de nos grands débats sur la justice sociale, l'identité, la laïcité, la religion, le droit et l'éthique publique. Maclure démontre comment la réflexion philosophique peut être subtile et rigoureuse tout en étant accessible et invitante. Il aborde des questions aussi variées que les accommodements raisonnables, les politiques d'austérité, l'éducation, la liberté d'expression, les changements climatiques, le nationalisme et l'omniprésence du baratin dans le discours public avec la profondeur et la perspicacité qu'on lui connaît. Ce livre est indispensable tant pour ceux qui souhaitent approfondir leur réflexion sur les enjeux de l'heure que pour ceux qui veulent s'initier aux grandes questions politiques d'aujourd'hui. -- [Renaud-Bray].

Only a generation ago, female adolescence as we know it in the West did not exist in the Middle East. There were only children and married women. Today, young Arab women outnumber men in universities, and a few are beginning to face down religious and social tradition in order to live independently, to delay marriage, and to pursue professional goals. Hundreds of thousands of devout girls and women are attending Qur'anic schools--and using the training to argue for greater rights and freedoms from an Islamic perspective. And, in 2011, young women helped to lead antigovernment protests in the Arab Spring. But their voices have not been heard. Their stories have not been told. In Syria before its civil war she documents a complex society in the midst of soul searching about its place in the world and about the role of women. In Lebanon, she documents a country that on the surface is freer than other Arab nations but whose women must balance extreme standards of self-presentation with Islamic codes of virtue. In Abu Dhabi, Zoepf reports on a generation of Arab women who've found freedom in work outside the home. In Saudi Arabia she chronicles driving protests and women entering the retail industry for the first time. In the aftermath of Tahrir Square, she examines the crucial role of women in Egypt's popular uprising. Deeply informed, heartfelt, and urgent, Good Daughters brings us a new understanding of the changing Arab societies--from 9/11 to Tahrir Square to the rise of ISIS--and gives voice to the remarkable women at the forefront of this change""--  ""The never-before-reported story of this generation of Arab women, who are questioning authority, changing societies, and leading revolutions.

Europese lessen van Groen,Jelle Bijl,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL31712521W,/authors/OL11534083A/Jelle_Bijl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Aspekt|Language Dutch|Pages 74,"De antirevolutionaire staatsman en historicus Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer (1801-1876) staat bekend om zijn naar binnen gekeerde nationalisme, calvinisme en orangisme. Ook wordt hij door menigeen als conservatief denker beschouwd. In het eerste deel van dit essay wordt betoogd dat Groen de nationale kaders van zijn tijd oversteeg en dat hij gezien moet worden als Europese antirevolutionair. In het tweede deel wordt Groens Europastandpunt eerst vergeleken met dat van hedendaagse en prominente eurofielen als de Belgische Europarlementariër Guy Verhofstadt en de Duitse filosoof Jürgen Habermas en daarna met dat van eurosceptici als de bekende Nederlandse publicist Thierry Baudet en aanverwante denkers en historici. Hoewel Groens Europabeeld typisch negentiende-eeuwse kenmerken bezit en door zijn christelijke invulling nauwelijks bijval meer krijgt, blijkt dit met het oog op het huidige Europadebat desondanks verrassend actueel te zijn. Vooral omdat door de eurocrisis weer fundamentele vragen over de toekomst van de Europa worden gesteld. Vragen die ook de jonge Europese generaties aangaan. 0.

No obstante, dada la variedad de temas que abordó en su obra, y pese a las diversas interpretaciones a las que ésta ha dado lugar, algunos aspectos de su pensamiento aún no están debidamente situados en el mapa de las ideas actuales. Los artículos recogidos en este volumen corren a cargo de destacadas especialistas en la obra de Arendt (como es el caso de Seyla Benhabib y Fina Birulés), así como de otros pensadores que aúnan un buen conocimiento de la autora con un reconocido prestigio en su especialidad (Victoria Camps en la ética o Fernando Vallespín en la ciencia política). El conjunto constituye un mosaico de ejercicios filosóficos que nos introduce en facetas cruciales del pensamiento arendtiano como el totalitarismo, la ética, la memoria o el republicanismo, y establecen un diálogo con una autora que sostenía “poco importa que mis ideas sean un poco dispersas o incluso parezcan contradecirse entre sí, con tal que sean ideas que lleven a los lectores a pensar por sí mismos” y cuya sombra se proyecta, lúcida y malhumorada, sobre el futuro.

They can't represent us!,Marina Sitrin,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL19980533W,/authors/OL3091489A/Marina_Sitrin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 250,"""From one of the key organizes of Occupy Wall Street and a leading activist in European social movements comes a book that shows a common thread in the recent upsurge in mass protests from Argentina to Greece to the Middle East to New York. The new movements, argue Marina Sitrin and Dario Azzellini, put forward a new conception of participatory democracy, challenging the idea that liberal, representative democracy--let alone the authoritarian regimes being challenged in the Middle East--is democratic, nor ever was. To make the argument and illustrate the kinds of democratic thinking being pioneered by the new movements, They Can't Represent Us! is propelled by scores of interviews with leading activists in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia, allowing readers entre;e to a fascinating array of protest and prefigurative movements across the world. The book provides one of the most extensive portraits of the assemblies, direct democracy forums, factory takeovers, cooperatives, and organizational forms championed by the new movements, and its truly global focus provides a kind of political travelogue of the cutting edge of global activism""--  ""Here is one of the first books to assert that mass protest movements in disparate places such as Greece, Argentina, and the United States share an agenda--to raise the question of what democracy should mean. These horizontalist movements, including Occupy, exercise and claim participatory democracy as the ground of revolutionary social change today. Written by two international activist intellectuals and based on extensive interviews with movement participants in Spain, Venezuela, Japan, across the United States, and elsewhere, this book is both one of the most expansive portraits of the assemblies, direct democracy forums, and organizational forms championed by the new movements, and an analytical history of direct and participatory democracy from ancient Athens to Athens today. The new movements put forward the idea that liberal democracy is not democratic, nor was it ever""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Silent revolution,Barry Rubin,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL19976194W?edition=ia%3Asilentrevolution0000rubi,/authors/OL73550A/Barry_Rubin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27156363M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Broadside Books|Language English|Pages 331,"Over the past fifty years, a silent revolution has allowed the radical left to seize power to an extent unthinkable only a decade ago. Stranger still, no one has noticed. Throughout the twentieth century, leftists worked tirelessly toward their goal of a proletarian revolution. But they continually fell short. American workers rejected socialism in the 1920s and declined to join the international communist movement in the 1930s. The New Left flowered briefly in the 1960s but petered out with the end of the Vietnam War. When the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991, radical Marxism seemed to have been defeated and discredited for good. Not so fast, says the political scientist Barry Rubin in this sharply pointed history of the modern American left. Far from disappearing, the radical left has undergone an ideological revolution and has rebranded itself as liberalism. Rubin traces the roots of this new ideology to the ideas of domestic radicals like Saul Alinsky, cultural Marxists like Antonio Gramsci, and Third World revolutionary thinkers like Frantz Fanon. This new brand of leftism constitutes a Third Left that now dominates the liberal movement in the United States. The Third Left's main ideological innovation is the abandonment of the working class as a revolutionary vehicle. Instead it targets the education system, and it has now trained several generations of Americans to think in leftist terms of fairness and social justice.

For years the Luddites roamed the English countryside, practicing drills and manoeuvres that they would later deploy on unsuspecting machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history; for Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of the antagonistic relationship between all workers, including us today, and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The Luddites weren't primitive and they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the twenty-first century world. Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labour and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance-evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working-class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is intimidating, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|2 Currently reading|1 Have read

Se aborda la denominada independencia  efímera de Núñez de Cáceres en Santo Domingo y se evidencia que no existió ningún tipo de vínculos de éste con la Gran Colombia y que sus movimiento perseguía de modo esencial no perder sus esclabos ante la inminente invación de los haitianos. Se discurre en torno a la relación del presidente haitiano Petión y Bolívar, la estadía del Libertador en Haití. Su presencia como exiliado en Jamaica. Además se insertan importantes episodios de su aguerrida campaña en pro la liberación de la Gran Colombia.""--Page 4 of cover.

In democratic societies there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to incorporate citizens’ input in decision-making processes in more or less structured ways. But participatory decision making is balancing on the borders of inclusion, structure, precision and accuracy. To simply enable more participation will not yield enhanced democracy, and there is a clear need for more elaborated elicitation and decision analytical tools.    This rigorous and thought-provoking volume draws on a stimulating variety of international case studies, from flood risk management in the Red River Delta of Vietnam, to the consideration of alternatives to gold mining in Roșia Montană in Transylvania, to the application of multi-criteria decision analysis in evaluating the impact of e-learning opportunities at Uganda's Makerere University.    Editors Love Ekenberg (senior research scholar, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA], Laxenburg, professor of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University), Karin Hansson (artist and research fellow, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University), Mats Danielson (vice president and professor of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, affiliate researcher, IIASA) and Göran Cars (professor of Societal Planning and Environment, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm) draw innovative collaborations between mathematics, social science, and the arts.    They develop new problem formulations and solutions, with the aim of carrying decisions from agenda setting and problem awareness through to feasible courses of action by setting objectives, alternative generation, consequence assessments, and trade-off clarifications.    As a result, this book is important new reading for decision makers in government, public administration and urban planning, as well as students and researchers in the fields of participatory democracy, urban planning, social policy, communication design, participatory art, decision theory, risk analysis and computer and systems sciences.

When the resources they deliver or the reforms they advocate weaken rather than strengthen the state's decision- and policy-making functions, their efforts can do more harm than good. Donors can also do harm by creating a brain drain away from state organizations - for instance, by hiring the most qualified civil servants. When aid is delivered in a way that actually acts as a disincentive to states to consolidate their own revenue base, this can slow the development of the state's own capacity. How can donors ensure they do no harm? How can they be sure they intervene constructively in fragile situations? This publication provides practical guidance based on the results of research undertaken on behalf of the OECD DAC International Network on Conflict and Fragility (INCAF). The book is based on comparative case studies of six countries (Afghanistan, Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nepal, Rwanda and Sierra Leone) and a comprehensive literature review. It addresses how the interventions of OECD countries may risk undermining positive statebuilding processes, and makes recommendations as to how this may be avoided in the future.--Publisher's description.

Offering a highly nuanced and complex picture of 'older' and 'newer' political theology, these scholars examine the multifaceted interconnections and tensions between political theologies, liberation theologies, feminist theologies, and theologies that see themselves as 'postcolonial' or 'decolonizing.' Among other topics, the authors address the ecumenical and global nature of political theology; the lack of critical feminist analysis in most political, liberation, and postcolonial theologies; the statements regarding political theology in the encyclicals of Benedict XVI; and the specific tasks that political theology must address to remain effective and relevant.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But how extensive should those powers be, and where should their limits lie? What are the legitimate functions of government, and what is their proper justification? Should a nation's constitution aim at securing the general welfare of its citizens, and, if so, how is the general welfare to be defined? What protections should a constitution afford to individual rights, and how should these rights be specified? The essays in this volume--written by prominent philosophers, political scientists, and legal scholars--address these questions and explore related issues. Some essays examine the basic purposes of constitutions and their status as fundamental law. Some deal with specific constitutional provisions: they ask, for example, which branches of government should have the authority to conduct foreign policy, or how the judiciary should be organized, or what role a preamble should play in a nation's founding document. Other essays explore questions of constitutional design: they consider the advantages of a federal system of government, or the challenges of designing a constitution for a pluralistic society--or they ask what form of constitution best promotes personal liberty and economic prosperity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Challenging the common assumption that models of direct democracy and representative democracy are necessarily at odds, Direct Democracy Worldwide demonstrates how practices of direct and representative democracy interact under different institutional settings and uncovers the conditions that allow them to coexist in a mutually reinforcing manner. Whereas citizen-initiated mechanisms of direct democracy can spur productive relationships between citizens and political parties, other mechanisms of direct democracy often help leaders bypass other representative institutions, undermining republican checks and balances. The book also demonstrates that the embrace of direct democracy is costly, may generate uncertainties and inconsistencies, and in some cases is easily manipulated. Nonetheless, the promise of direct democracy should not be dismissed. Direct democracy is much more than a simple, pragmatic second choice when representative democracy seems not to be working as expected. Properly designed, it can empower citizens, breaking through some of the institutionalized barriers to accountability that arise in representative systems""--Provided by publisher.

How did it come to this? In Can Democracy Work? James Miller, the author of the classic history of 1960s protest Democracy Is in the Streets, offers a lively, surprising, and urgent history of the democratic idea from its first stirrings to the present. As he shows, democracy has always been rife with inner tensions. The ancient Greeks preferred to choose leaders by lottery and regarded elections as inherently corrupt and undemocratic. The French revolutionaries sought to incarnate the popular will, but many of them came to see the people as the enemy. And in the United States, the franchise would be extended to some even as it was taken from others. Amid the wars and revolutions of the twentieth century, communists, liberals, and nationalists all sought to claim the ideals of democracy for themselves--even as they manifestly failed to realize them.

Cet ouvrage propose une sélection de textes rédigés par les plus grands académiciens. Cet ouvrage de référence permet de découvrir Napoléon sous un jour nouveau : de son enfance avec notamment le portrait de sa mère par Alain Decaux, à son caractère émaillé par Alphonse Lamartine pour sa duplicité ou loué par Max Gallo pour son courage face à l'exil , jusqu'aux moindres détails de son intimité, avec une revue de son habillement et plus particulièrement de ses couvre-chefs par Edmond Rostand. Tous ces textes associés à ceux de Jules Michelet, Victor Hugo ou Jean Tulard seront illustrés par des oeuvres réalisées par les membres de l'Académie des Beaux-Arts. Napoléon, l'intime et l'exceptionnel s'adresse aussi bien aux avertis qu'aux amateurs de littérature et d'histoire et surtout aux lecteurs curieux d'entrer dans la légende de cet homme au destin prodigieux grâce à la qualité des textes rédigés par les meilleurs auteurs français.""--From Publisher description.

The Mwakenya Movement (Muungano wa Wazalendo wa Kenya/ Union of Patriotic Kenyans) was an underground socialist movement in Kenya in the 1980s formed to fight for multi-party democracy.  Independence means self-determination and self-government. An independent nation is one with the autonomy to make decisions, which will advance the welfare of its people. It is a nation that controls its own resources, and has the political and economic scope to utilise these resources, human and natural, free of foreign interference.  Independence in this sense has little relevance to the current Kenyan situation. Citizens find themselves in a dependent neocolonial country, wholly subservient to foreign interests. The country’s economy is geared to the needs of foreigners, both to the ex-colonial masters and other Western imperialist nations. Neocolonialism is not merely an academic debate in Kenya, it is a condition in which the people live day-by-day, a form of oppression and exploitation every bit as effective as that practiced by the British imperialist powers.  Mwakenya believes that only a true revolutionary democratic system, controlled by Kenyans can bring fundamental changes in the country and liberate the people from foreign domination and national oppression, overhaul the corrupt neocolonial system, and establish an egalitarian system for the Kenyan people."" - African Books Collective   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

COVID-19 and the Global Predators: We Are the Prey,Peter Roger Breggin,political_science,First published in 2021,/works/OL26038057W,/authors/OL36625A/Peter_Roger_Breggin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL35140575M-M.jpg,"Publish Date September 30, 2021|Publisher  Lake Edge Press|Language English|Pages 690","COVID-19 and the Global Predators is much more than an analysis of the current exploitation of humanity under cover of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. It discloses for the first time the actual blueprint and master plan that that was ten years in the making by global predators before the pandemic: a plan to reorganize the world in the name of public health. Billionaires, government agencies, giant funds, and major industries collaborated years ahead of time to lay the groundwork for what would become Operation Warp Speed and the Great Reset in 2020. All this is disclosed, individuals and groups are named, and their plans for the future are documented. The book concludes with chapters on what America and the world must do in the coming weeks and months to save humanity's freedoms.  Many top medical and public health experts treating and examining COVID 19 agree this is the most comprehensive book about who and what is behind the draconian measures that are crushing individual freedoms and many of the societies and economies of the Western World including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.  Three of these medical doctors have confirmed this in their introductions to the book: physicians Peter McCullough MD MPH, Vladimir ""Zev"" Zelenko MD and Elizabeth Lee Vliet MD. They are echoed by endorsements from Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Paul Alexander PhD.  This book thoroughly documents solid answers to these tragic questions about the global predators who are reaping enormous benefits from COVID-19 suffering including wealth, power and the destruction of America as an opposition to globalism.  Who are the ""they""-these Global Predators? What are their motives and their plans for us?  How can we defend against them?  Why did they:  ■ Plan Warp Speed for a SARS-CoV pandemic years before it came?  ■ Distribute mRNA and DNA vaccines that killed lab animals and now humans?  ■ Collaborate with the Chinese making pandemic viruses & bioweapons?  ■ Hide the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan Institute?  ■ Let China spread the virus around the world on passenger planes?  ■ Give so much power to Dr. Anthony Fauci?  Why do they continue to:  ■ Prohibit cheap, available, safe and eﬀective COVID-19 treatments?  ■ Impose draconian closures on our society and economy?  ■ Disproportionately harm or destroy small businesses and churches?  ■ Make us wear masks and distance ourselves from each other?  ■ Exaggerate the death rate from COVID-19 to frighten us?  ■ Hide the high and growing vaccine death rate from all of us?  ■ Make experimental ""vaccines"" that turn our bodies against ourselves?

The assault on international law,Jens David Ohlin,political_science,First published in 2014,/works/OL19667622W,/authors/OL3376048A/Jens_David_Ohlin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 289,"""International law presents a conceptual riddle.  Why comply with it when there is no world government to enforce it? The United States has a long history of skepticism towards international law, but 9/11 ushered in a particularly virulent phase of American exceptionalism. Torture became official government policy, President Bush denied that the Geneva Conventions applied to the war against al-Qaeda, and the US drifted away from international institutions like the International Criminal Court and the United Nations.  Although American politicians and their legal advisors are often the public face of this attack, the root of this movement is a coordinated and deliberate attack by law professors hostile to its philosophical foundations, including Eric Posner, Jack Goldsmith, Adrian Vermeule, and John Yoo.  In a series of influential writings they have claimed that since states are motivated primarily by self-interest, compliance with international law is nothing more than high-minded talk.  Theses abstract arguments then provide a foundation for dangerous legal conclusions: that international law is largely irrelevant to determining how and when terrorists can be captured or killed; that the US President alone should be directing the War on Terror without significant input from Congress or the judiciary; that US courts should not hear lawsuits alleging violations of international law; and that the US should block any international criminal court with jurisdiction over Americans.  Put together, these polemical accounts had an enormous impact on how politicians conduct foreign policy and how judges decide cases - ultimately triggering America's pernicious withdrawal from international cooperation.  In The Assault on International Law, Jens Ohlin exposes the mistaken assumptions of these 'New Realists,' in particular their impoverished utilization of rational choice theory. In contrast, he provides an alternate vision of international law based on a truly innovative theory of human rationality. According to Ohlin, rationality requires that agents follow through on their plans even when faced with opportunities for defection. Seen in this light, international law is the product of nation-states cooperating to escape a brutish State of Nature--a result that is not only legally binding but also in each state's self-interest""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Inwieweit sie dieser gerecht wird und ob sie Ansatzpunkte für eine Reform der deutschen Familienpolitik bieten kann, ist Gegenstand dieser Arbeit. Eine Untersuchung der bevölkerungs- und frauenpolitischen Zielsetzung der Familienpolitik zeigt, daß die Ausgestaltung familienpolitischer Leistungen in Frankreich eher dazu beiträgt, eine Erhöhung der Geburtenzahlen zu bewirken und Familien- und Erwerbsleben miteinander in Einklang zu bringen. Aus verteilungspolitischer Sicht kann jedoch der deutsche Familienlastenausgleich durchaus Anregungen geben, die französische Regelung zu verbessern.

SSR theory and practice are criticized for being overly focused on traditional conflict and post-conflict settings and for being unable to adjust to unconventional settings marked by chronic crime and terrorism. SSR tends to be disproportionately focused on national institutions and less amenable to engaging at the subnational scale. Drawing on the experiences of so-called ‘citizen security’ measures in cities across Latin America and the Caribbean, this paper offers some opportunities for renewing and revitalizing SSR. The emphasis of citizen security interventions on multiple forms of insecurity, data-driven and evidence-informed prevention, the promotion of social cohesion and efficacy and designing crime prevention into the social and built environment are all insights that can positively reinforce comprehensive SSR measures in the 21st century.

Bubba, the protagonist, is a Naval military retiree running from a traumatic past toward a personal dream he is already living but fails to recognize.  Other important themes include religion, parenting, politics, male friendship and chauvinism.  First and foremost, however, this is a love story between a man and his ex-wife, a man and his off-spring, and a man in love with life in general.  In an era of emphasis on higher education and a culture-wide push toward an informed electorate, it is good to remember what was once a common understanding, that formal education is not the only route toward knowledge.  Bubba Lee Boatbum is a life-smart common man who knows when to dodge the “guvmint” and where to read between the lines of the latest political spin.  He manages to live a life of honor and camaraderie by applying common sense and experiential intelligence to life's often chaotic circumstances.  Bubba shows us that a good heart and good intentions still count on the field of life's everyday battles.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Daß diese Frage nach wie vor aktuell ist, belegen auch in heutigen Demokratien noch existierende Lager. Dieses Buch untersucht die bereits von Hannah Arendt entwickelte These, das Lager sei das Paradigma des modernen Raums. Die Perspektive verschärft sich im Zusammenhang mit der Diskussion um die Entstehung der Biopolitik bei Michel Foucault, der die Lager auf Praktiken der Produktion von Leben und die politische Kontrolle von Populationen seit dem 18. Jahrhundert zurückführt. Giorgio Agamben schließlich sieht in den Lagern die Matrix des Raums, in dem wir leben. Die Erörterung der vorliegenden Ansätze wird ergänzt durch Sondierungen der ästhetischen Bedingungen des Funktionierens von Lagern: Was ist ein Lager? Wie ist die Erfahrung des Lagers zu vermitteln? Was bleibt, wenn ein Lager zu funktionieren aufgehört hat?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Holtzman--a master technologist, internet pioneer, security analyst, and former military codebreaker--presents a comprehensive insider's expos? of the world of invasive technology, who's using it, and how our privacy is at risk. Holtzman starts out by categorizing privacy violations into ""The 7 Sins Against Privacy"" and then goes on to explain in compelling and easy to understand language exactly how privacy is being eroded in every aspect of our lives.      Holtzman vividly reveals actual invasions and the dangers associated with the loss of privacy, and he takes a realistic look at the trade offs between privacy and such vital issues as security, rights, and economic development.    Praise for Privacy Lost    ""Whether we know it or not, we have all become citizens of the Digital Age. As such we need to take responsibility for our conduct, our safety, and our privacy. David Holtzman is deeply knowledgeable about the industry and passionate about the issues. Regardless of your political views, you will come away from this book better equipped to meet the challenges before us all.""  --Geoffrey A. Moore, author, Dealing with Darwin: How Great Companies Innovate at Every Phase of Their Evolution    ""Holtzman has drafted a blueprint all citizens of this great land ought to read if they desire to understand what privacy truly means, why it is important to both their everyday life as well as to their understanding of what it really means to be free, and what they can do to salvage what little privacy is left them. Privacy Lost needs to be readily available on the desks of all concerned citizens--heavily dog-eared and underlined.""  --Bob Barr, practicing attorney and former Member of theUnited States House of Representatives   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book examines how Mexican immigrants who have made these towns their homes have integrated legally, culturally, and institutionally. What accounts for the massive growth in the Mexican immigrant populations in these two small towns, and what does the future hold for them? Based on 260 surveys and 47 in-depth interviews, this study combines quantitative and qualitative research to explore the level and characteristics of immigrant incorporation in Beardstown and Monmouth. It assesses the advancement of immigrants in the immigration/ residency/citizenship process, the immigrants' level of cultural integration (via language, their connectedness with other members of society, and their relationships with neighbors), the degree and characteristics of discrimination against immigrants in these two towns, and the extent to which immigrants participate in different social and political activities and trust government institutions. Immigrants in new destinations are likely to be poorer, to be less educated, and to have weaker English-language skills than immigrants in traditional destinations. Studying how this population negotiates the obstacles to and opportunities for incorporation is crucial""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, the contentious dialogue between two seemingly-contrasting camps is based upon assumptions and stereotypes, rather than facts: the Christian right misrepresents the left as a movement inspired by moral relativism, while the left erroneously frames the Christian right as theocratically-driven. Beyond Religious Right and Secular Left Rhetoric uncovers the actual differences between these groups, examining how both movements have similar conceptual histories. By stressing their oft-ignored similarities (promotion of religious freedom, freedom of conscience, and separation of church and state), the book seeks to better inform partisans and the public at-large in order to move the debate beyond assumptions""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this book Jason Arnold explores the surprising extent of government secrecy in both national security and domestic policy areas in administrations since the 1970s. He lays out the costs of excessive secrecy, shows how government agencies keep their proceedings secret, and suggests remedies to promote a more open government. This is a timely contribution to the national debates about government secrecy sparked by the actions of Edward Snowden and the revelation about the extent of secret government spying on civilians here and abroad""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

During World War II some 40,000 Jews found themselves under Japanese occupation in Manchuria, China and countries of South East Asia. Virtually all of them survived the war, unlike their brethren in Europe. This book traces the evolution of Japan's policy towards the Jews from the beginning of the 20th century, the existence of anti-Semitism in Japan, and why Japan ignored repeated Nazi demands to become involved in the ""final solution.""

The drug war has also resulted in extreme levels of violence as drug traffickers and organized criminals compete for control of territory. Prohibitionist policies have destroyed the lives of millions of people as prisons warehouse drug offenders. This important volume represents an effort to map new approaches to drug policies. The contributors write from various disciplinary backgrounds and provide crucial insights on a wide-range of topics, including the gang-drug nexus, delinquency, legalization, trafficking, decriminalization, intervention programs and prison reform. The volume also provides a number of policy solutions and alternatives to the current drug strategies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

POLICY DESIGN FACTORS RELATED TO PRENATAL HEALTH CARE IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE NETHERLANDS,Patricia Files Smart,political_science,First published in 1994,/works/OL12278962W,/authors/OL5368296A/Patricia_Files_Smart,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 155,"The study of policy design instruments allows scholars to examine policy intent and content. It also enables scholars to begin to infer predictive capabilities of instruments. This study examined the instruments of policies addressing infant mortality in both South Carolina and the Netherlands.  Two questions were addressed: (1) what policy design factors are crucial to program strategists to ensure an effective program, and (2) how do the tools and their underlying assumptions that address infant mortality and prenatal care in the two sites differ? South Carolina's infant mortality rate of 10.5 percent is significantly higher than the 8 percent infant mortality rate in the Netherlands.  A limited ethnographic design was employed to analyze policy instruments through the implicit or explicit behavioral theories found in law, regulations and programs using a framework offered by Schneider & Ingram (1990). This study found that both South Carolina and the Netherlands used authoritative, incentive and capacity building instruments to address infant mortality. However, the focus of the instruments differed. Whereas South Carolina addressed the event of pregnancy as the focus of instruments, the Netherlands focused their tools at the prevention of unwanted pregnancies.  Findings. Conclusions of this study indicate the specific factors which may impact design and outcome.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
FACTORS AFFECTING THE CONTINUATION RATE OF NURSE PRACTITIONER PROGRAMS ONCE FEDERAL FUNDING IS DISCONTINUED,Joan Marlene Stanley,political_science,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267815W,/authors/OL5359658A/Joan_Marlene_Stanley,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 207,"The purpose of this research was to examine the organizations that have received Nurse Practitioner Training Grant monies and their internal and external environments in an attempt to discover why certain institutions continue innovative programs and why others discontinue programs once federal seed money is terminated.  Using open systems theory and Levine's Compatibility/Profitability Theory on why innovative programs in education are continued, two phases of research were conducted across the 36 institutions that had previously received NPTG monies. Phase I consisted of in-depth interviews with project directors, deans, and faculty of the nurse practitioner programs at four institutions. Two of the institutions had continued and two had discontinued their nurse practitioner programs. In Phase II, a questionnaire was sent to the 32 remaining project directors. The questionnaire elicited information on factors internal and external to the institution that had influenced the decision to continue the program once federal monies were terminated. Contributions made to the institution by the programs were also rated.  Those factors which had the greatest influence on programs which had been discontinued were: lack of funding, change in the institution's priorities, and change in the school of nursing's priorities. The factors which had the greatest effect on the programs that had been continued were: the American Nurses' Association's decision to require a master's degree and a change in the school of nursing's priorities. Large contributions to the institutions were made in only two areas by those programs that had been discontinued: the health care services provided to the community and recognition for the program and institution within the state. Those programs that had been continued, however, made large contributions in six areas: the two listed above and national recognition, an enhanced image of nursing in the region, improved public relations within the community and direct influence on other aspects of the school.  Findings from this research supported Levine's Compatibility/Profitability Theory. Those innovative programs which are not incompatible with the norms and values of the institution and are profitable to the institution are more likely to be continued after federal seed monies are discontinued.

"HOSPITAL STAFF NURSE DUTIES: A SURVEY OF PHYSICIANS, HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS, NURSING ADMINISTRATORS, AND NURSING EDUCATORS",Gene Beryl Hamrick Campbell,political_science,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267588W,/authors/OL5359449A/Gene_Beryl_Hamrick_Campbell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 151,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the level of agreement among physicians, chief hospital administrators, nursing administrators, and nursing educators when rating essentiality of certain tasks performed by hospital staff nurses. A sample of 245, composed of 55 physicians, 52 hospital administrators, 67 nursing administrators, and 71 nursing educators, represented acute care hospitals and baccalaureate nursing schools in Alabama. Data were collected using an instrument developed by the researcher. Statistical analysis of the data included factor analysis, MANOVA and Scheffe's test.  Results of the study indicate a difference among physicians, hospital administrators, nursing administrators, and nursing educators when rating level of essentiality of nursing tasks. It was further concluded that hospital location, hospital size, and ANA membership status of nurses have effects on essentiality rating of nursing tasks.  The study suggests that physicians, hospital administrators, and nursing administrators need to be included in planning nursing curricula, if varied staffing needs for hospitals are to be met by nursing education programs. An occupational analysis of nursing jobs is recommended as a curriculum framework for hospital nurses.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

He argues that liberal theorists should admit that their doctrine is not neutral with regard to conceptions of the good life - that it in fact fosters ideals of personal autonomy and a pluralist environment. These ideals generate irreconcilable, tragic conflicts between liberal and nonliberal ideals, and it is only by taking these conflicts seriously that liberals can learn of the unwanted consequences of liberal doctrine, effectively rebut critics, and react adequately to the complex pluralism of contemporary societies.""--Jacket.

On the basis of principles such as the free disposition of parties, the attenuated inquisitorial principle or the principles of orality and directness, the judge and the parties form a ?working group? when investigating the matter in dispute. The Austrian concept of an active judge, however, goes along with the judge?s duty to do case-management and especially to induce a truthful fact-finding using judicial discretion. While only five means of proof (documents, witnesses, expert opinions, evidence by inspection and the examination of parties) are explicitly listed the Austrian civil procedure code, there is no numerus clausus regarding the means of evidence. Evidence may be freely assessed by the judge.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Obvladovanje kreditnega tveganja pri ban?nem poslovanju,?an Jan Oplotnik,political_science,,/works/OL20931872W,/authors/OL8012203A/an_Jan_Oplotnik,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Institute for Local Self-Government and Public Procurement Maribor|Language Slovene|Pages 65,"Risk in banking business can not be avoided because the latter is strongly embedded in the very nature of it and banks should therefore be aware of the importance of effective risk management, encompassing the identification, measurement and assessment of each type of risk. Risk management can be important source of gaining competitive advantage and a way to survive in the world of banking. One of the most important risk in bank is the credit risk. Credit risk can be defined as the potential that a bank borrower or counterparty will fail to meet its obligations. The goal of credit risk management is to maximise bank´s risk-adjusted rate of return by maintaining credit risk exposure within acceptable parameters. Banks need to manage the credit risk inherent in the entire portfolio as well as the risk in invidual credits of transaction. Banks should also consider the relationships between credit risk and other risks. The effective management of credit risk is a comprehensive component of a comprehensive approach to risk management and essential to the long-term success of bank. Risk management is usualy regulated by bank directives, prescriptions, where the most important in Slovenia is the Law about banking with under law acts.

Fiscal Decentralisation and Local Government Financing in Serbia and Montenegro,Jadranka Kalu?erovi?,political_science,,/works/OL20931873W,/authors/OL8012204A/Jadranka_Kalu_erovi,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Institute for Local Self-Government and Public Procurement Maribor|Language English|Pages 388,"This book focuses on the fiscal decentralisation processes and the systems of local government financing in Serbia and Montenegro in the period 2000-2015. The retrospective analysis of the decentralisation processes in both countries show that they have been moving back and forth between decentralisation and centralisation, constantly swinging the pendulum of political discourse and the legal framework on intergovernmental fiscal governance. During the observed period, the systems of local government financing in both countries have often undergone drastic changes. Thus, this study focuses on the analysis of the impact of the legal framework related to intergovernmental fiscal relations, fiscal decentralisation and local government financing in Serbia and Montenegro on local government budgets. By applying both normative and economic analyses, as well as both quantitative and qualitative research methods, the study evaluates the legal quality and economic and factual effects of relevant legislation on local government budgets and status in the period 2000-2015. The study is divided into four parts: 1) Introduction; 2) Case Study: Serbia; 3) Case Study: Montenegro (both case studies include normative, economic and empirical analyses of the fiscal decentralisation process and the system of local government financing); 4) Comparative conclusions and recommendations.

Evidence in Civil Law - Ireland,Brid Moriarty,political_science,,/works/OL20931878W,/authors/OL8012207A/Brid_Moriarty,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Institute for Local Self-Government and Public Procurement Maribor|Language English|Pages 120,"Ireland as a common law jurisdiction operates an adversarial system. Ireland has a written Constitution, Bunreacht na h-Éireann. Other sources of law include legislation and European Union Law and a doctrine of precedent operates. This paper comprises a discussion of the law of evidence in Irish Civil Procedure. It follows the structure of a questionnaire circulated for the purposes of a comparative study as part of an EU wide project and is repetitive in parts. It was completed between November 2013 and August 2014 and in the interim there have been significant developments in the Irish legal system, most notably the establishment of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court decision in D.P.P. v. J.C. [2015] IESC 31, which modified the exclusionary rule concerning unconstitutionally obtained evidence. The primary form of proof in Irish courts is oral evidence. Competent witnesses are generally compellable. Usually testimony, on oath or affirmation, is given viva voce in open court before the Judge and where necessary a jury, and in the presence of the parties. The right to cross-examine is constitutionally guaranteed. In civil cases, the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. The burden of proof rests on the party which asserts. The principle of audi alteram partem applies. A distinction is drawn between unconstitutionally obtained evidence and illegally obtained evidence. There is pre-trial discovery. Evidence taking by and for foreign courts is discussed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On the fiftieth anniversary of King's assassination, the man and his activism are as close to public consciousness as ever. But despite his stature, the significance of King's writings and political thought remains underappreciated. In To Shape a New World, Tommie Shelby and Brandon Terry write that the marginalization of King's ideas reflects a romantic, consensus history that renders the civil rights movement inherently conservative--an effort not at radical reform but at ""living up to"" enduring ideals laid down by the nation's founders. On this view, King marshaled lofty rhetoric to help redeem the ideas of universal (white) heroes, but produced little original thought. This failure to engage deeply and honestly with King's writings allows him to be conscripted into political projects he would not endorse, including the pernicious form of ""color blindness"" that insists, amid glaring race-based injustice, that racism has been overcome. Cornel West, Danielle Allen, Martha Nussbaum, Robert Gooding-Williams, and other authors join Shelby and Terry in careful, critical engagement with King's understudied writings on labor and welfare rights, voting rights, racism, civil disobedience, nonviolence, economic inequality, poverty, love, just-war theory, virtue ethics, political theology, imperialism, nationalism, reparations, and social justice. In King's exciting and learned work, the authors find an array of compelling challenges to some of the most pressing political dilemmas of our present, and rethink the legacy of this towering figure.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Through an innovative re-reading of the existentialist notion of 'anxiety', Malone-France develops a 'fallibilist' warrant for classic liberal norms of tolerance, non-coercion, and individual freedom, disclosing ""the religious logic of liberal autonomy.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To redress the balance, Richard Mullin has translated 25 documents from this period, most of which express an anti-Lenin view. They include articles from Rabochee Delo, the Jewish Bund's Poslednie Izvestiia and the post-Lenin Iskra, pamphlets by Plekhanov and Martov, the resolutions of Party meetings and some very revealing private correspondence. However, the result is not an anti-Bolshevik polemic: through these documents a clearer, and curiously flattering picture of Lenin's thought and activity is obtained""--Provided by publisher.

This anthology brings together the work of distinguished contemporary political philosophers and theorists who address the leading normative and conceptual issues concerning war. The book is divided into three parts: initiating war, waging war, and ending war. The contributors aim to provide a comprehensive introduction to each of these main areas of dispute concerning war. Each essay is an original contribution to ongoing debates on various aspects of war and also provides a survey of the main topics in each subfield. Serving as a companion to the theoretical issues pertaining to war, this volume also is an important contribution to debates in political philosophy. It can serve as a textbook for relevant courses on war offered in philosophy departments, religious studies programs, and law schools.

Using insights from contemporary cultural theory, the contributors address questions of political identity and popular culture, state violence and genocide, speed machines and militarism, gender and resistance, cyberwar and mass media - connecting each question to a generalised re-thinking of the spaces of politics at the global scale. Rethinking Geopolitics argues that the concept of geopolitics needs to be conceptualised anew as the twenty first century approaches. Challenging conventional geopolitical assumptions, the diverse chapters include analyses of: theories of post-modern geopolitics, historical formulations of states and cold wars, the geopolitics of the Holocaust, the gendered dimension of Kurdish insurgency, the cold war world, political cartoons concerning Bosnia, Time magazine representations of the Persian Gulf, the Zapatistas and the Chiapas revolt, the new cyber politics, conflict simulations in the US military, and the emergence of a new geopolitics of global security. Exploring how popular cultural assumptions about geography and politics constitute the discourses of contemporary violence and political economy, Rethinking Geopolitics brings the ideas of a new generation of scholars to a wide audience for the first time.

Beslutningsteori angår os alle. Alle er vi med til, eller vil gerne være med til, at træffe beslutninger inden eller uden for de organisationer, vi arbejder i.  Disse modeller trækker på viden fra sociologi, socialpsykologi og politisk videnskab i modsætning til de beslutningsmodeller, som er bygget op omkring traditionel driftsøkonomi, statistik og operationsanalyse.   Endvidere tages en række emner op, som har en snæver tilknytning til beslutningsprocessen: målsætningsprocesser, styring, magt og indflydelse, kreativitet/planlægning, effektivitetsvurdering, og disse emner behandles i en beslutningsteoretisk ramme.

Moreover both political systems have some similar objectives. What communism tried to achieve with the use of the most brutal measures on a massive scale has been to a considerable degree achieved in a liberal democracy through a more or less spontaneous development and more or less humane social engineering, an almost total identification of man with a political regime, politicization of culture and social relations, omnipresence of ideology, and a peculiar combination of a utopian impulse with the insistence of human mediocrity. Both systems reduce human nature to that of the common man who is led to believe himself liberated from unnecessary obligations of the past, unaware that he shackled himself with other chains which dramatically narrowed his perspective. Both the communist man and the liberal democratic man refuse to admit that there exists anything of value outside the political systems to which they pledged their loyalty and both refuse to undertake any critical examination of their ideological prejudices""--Publisher.

The essays in this collection focus on the perennial but newly urgent questions of how the tension between relativism and the moral universalism current in contemporary politics can be resolved within the framework of liberalism."" ""While recognizing the dangers of moral imperialism, Lukes argues that a relativist position based on identifying clearly distinct cultural and moral communities is incoherent. Drawing on work in anthropology and philosophy, he examines the nature of social justice, the politics of identity and human rights theory, as well as discussing how ideas drawn from the work of Isaiah Berlin can shed light on these debates.""--Jacket.

The chapter starts with a summary of the main tenets of Laclau and Mouffe?s discourse theory, and touches upon its methodological/analytical translation in discourse-theoretical analysis (DTA). The next main part of the chapter discusses how discourse theory has been put to use for the analysis of communication and media, distinguishing four thematic areas: (1) communication, rhetoric, and media strategies; (2) discourses in media organizations; (3) media identities, practices, and institutions; and (4) media and agonistic democracy. In the next part, two areas that are currently being developed in the group, and have thus far remained under-developed, are singled out theoretically as well as empirically, from a discourse-theoretical perspective. This includes the relation between the discursive and the material, and the relation between media, communication, and audiences. Finally, the chapter provides a short overview of the other chapters in this book.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They demonstrate clearly that political decisions are not made in a vacuum, but in the context of specific historical constraints and social demands.The book begins with an overview of the features and events which have shaped the political landscape of Europe up to the end of the twentieth century. The authors go on to discuss liberal democracy, historical sources of conflict between countries, electoral systems, political parties and interest groups, governments and parliaments. The final section looks at fedaralism and EU decision-making and concludes with a consideration of how liberal democracies in western Europe have attempted to provide stable government while remaining responsive to changes in society.This book has been fully updated to take account of the French, British and Italian general elections that have occurred in recent years, as well as the momentous changes that have taken place in global politics as a result of the September 11 terrorist attack, and the preparations for EU enlargement. The chapters on the European Union and democracy in western Europe have also been substantially revised to take account of globalisation and recent political corruption issues.

Legaliteit en legitimiteit,Paul Cliteur,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL23498962W,/authors/OL5713701A/Paul_Cliteur,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Leiden University Press|Pages 289,"""Legaliteit en legitimiteit"" takes one of the central problems of law and jurisprudence as its point of departure: what is the law? Adopting an intermediate position between legal positivism and natural law, this book reflects on the concept of ‘liberal democracy’ or ‘constitutional democracy’. In five chapters the book analyses: (i) the idea of higher law, (ii) liberal democracy as a legitimate model for the state, (iii) the separation of church and state or secularism as essential for the democratic state, (iv) the universality of higher law principles, (v) the history of modern political thought. This interdisciplinary approach to jurisprudence is relevant for legal scholars, philosophers, political theorists, public intellectuals, historians, and politicians.

Can this lack of global democracy be justified? Which models of global politics should contemporary democrats endorse and which should they reject? What are the most promising pathways to global democratic change? To what extent does the extension of democracy from the national to the international level require a radical rethinking of what democratic institutions should be?

By presenting a broad range of views by prominent scholars, it offers an in-depth analysis of one of the key challenges of our century: globalizing democracy and democratizing globalization""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

After the May 4th Movement of 1919 (WusiYundong ), Confucianism lost much of its moral appeal and political authority and entered a kind of limbo, bearing blame for the backwardness and weakening of China. Now that China has asserted its political rights among world nations, it seems natural to ask whether Confucianism as a philosophy has a modern or even postmodern role to play for building modern China and for enlightening the world. This question is even more meaningful in light of the fact that there is a genuine need felt in China for a return to its Confucian heritage and vision for purposes of sustaining societal harmonization and reconstructing cultural identity in the modern world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Challenges to religious liberty in the twenty-first century,Gerard V.

But religious liberty is being challenged by new questions (for example, use of the niqab or church adoption services for same-sex couples) and new forces (such as globalization and Islamism). Combined, these make the meaning of religious liberty in the twenty-first century uncertain. This collection of essays by ten of the world's leading scholars on religious liberty takes aim at these issues. The book is arranged around five specific challenges to religious liberty today: the state's responsibility to prevent coercion and intimidation of believers by others within the same faith community; the U.S.'s basic moral responsibilities to promote religious liberty abroad; how to understand and apply the traditional right of conscientious objection in today's circumstances; the distinctive problems presented by globalization; and the viability today of an 'originalist' interpretation of the First Amendment religion clauses""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Basing her findings on long-term fieldwork with trading families, truckers, smugglers and scholars, Judith Scheele investigates the history of contemporary patterns of mobility from the late nineteenth century to the present. Through a careful analysis of family ties and local economic records, this book shows how long-standing mobility and interdependence have shaped not only local economies, but also notions of social hierarchy, morality and political legitimacy, creating patterns that endure today and that need to be taken into account in any empirically-grounded study of the region""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

La toma de la palabra por parte de intelectuales del Sur global, anteriormente llamado Tercer Mundo, ha supuesto un desafío a los moldes teóricos y narrativos impuestos por la colonización. Este «pensar desde el Sur» nos obliga a nosotros y nosotras, lectores del Primer Mundo, a tener en cuenta unas voces a las que nunca hemos prestado oídos. Nos obliga a salir del confortable universo de las teorías eurocéntricas y a adentrarnos en el reconocimiento de unos «otros» siempre desvalorizados. Este libro pretende afrontar este desafío y aprender a mirarnos con los ojos de los y las subalternas: las poblaciones dominadas por las potencias europeas a lo largo de siglos, y hoy ya también conciudadanas y conciudadanos nuestros en las grandes metrópolis globales.

Right-wing critics of American conservatism,"Hawley, George (Political scientist)",political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20017436W,/authors/OL7524977A/Hawley_George_(Political_scientist),/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  University Press of Kansas|Language English|Pages 366,"""The American conservative movement as we know it faces an existential crisis as the nation's demographics shift away from its core constituents - older white middle-class Christians. It is the American conservatism that we dont know that concerns George Hawley in this book. During its ascendancy, leaders within the conservative establishment have energetically policed the movements boundaries, effectively keeping alternative versions of conservatism out of view. Returning those neglected voices to the story, Right-Wing Critics of American Conservatism offers a more complete, complex, and nuanced account of the American right in all its dissonance in history and in our day. The right-wing intellectual movements considered here differ both from mainstream conservatism and from each other when it comes to fundamental premises, such as the value of equality, the proper role of the state, the importance of free markets, the place of religion in politics, and attitudes toward race. In clear and dispassionate terms, Hawley examines localists who exhibit equal skepticism toward big business and big government, paleoconservatives who look to the distant past for guidance and wish to turn back the clock, radical libertarians who are not content to be junior partners in the conservative movement, and various strains of white supremacy and the radical right in America. In the Internet age, where access is no longer determined by the select few, the independent right has far greater opportunities to make its many voices heard. This timely work puts those voices into context and historical perspective, clarifying our understanding of the American right - past, present, and future""--Publisher's website.

Electoral systems and political context,Robert G.

In the early 1990s, Japan and Russia each adopted a very similar version of a ""mixed-member"" electoral system. In the form used in Japan and Russia, in elections to a single house of the legislature each voter cast two ballots: one for a candidate in a single-member district (SMD) and one for a party under proportional representation (PR). In the SMD races, both countries used first-past-the-post (FPTP) rules, meaning that the candidate winning the largest number of votes in the district wins the race, even if tallying under a majority of all the SMD ballots cast. In PR, parties win shares of seats roughly in proportion to their share of the party vote. In both Japan and Russia, the PR systems used closed-list rules, meaning that prior to each election central party leaders put together a rank-ordered list of candidates to determine which individuals would win seats if the party won representation in PR. In PR in both countries, voters were only given the chance to choose a single pre-set party list. Both countries used mixed-member-majoritarian (MMM) electoral systems, meaning that the SMD and PR components of the system were ""unlinked"" - seats won by parties in one tier (e.g., SMDs) did not affect the number of seats allocated to the party in the other tier (e.g., PR). In short, both Russia and Japan adopted very similar forms of mixed-member electoral systems. In both countries, it was widely expected that the different rules would promote particular outcomes:""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet, few international actors are trained to understand or practice effective diplomacy. Poor diplomacy has contributed to repeated setbacks for the United States and other major powers in the last decade. Drawing on deep historical research, this book aims to 'reinvent' diplomacy for our current era. The original and comparative research provides a foundation for thinking about what successful outreach, negotiation, and relationship-building with foreign actors should look like. Instead of focusing only on failures, as most studies do, this one interrogates success. The book provides a framework for defining successful diplomacy and implementing it in diverse contexts. Chapters analyze the activities of diverse diplomats (including state and non-state actors) in enduring cases, including: post-WWII relief, the rise of the non-aligned movement, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the U.S. opening to China, the Camp David Accords, the reunification of Germany, the creation of the European Union, the completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and relief aid to pre-2001 Afghanistan. The cases are diverse and historical, but they are written with an eye toward contemporary challenges and opportunities. The book closes with systematic reflections on how current diplomats can improve their activities abroad. Foreign Policy Breakthroughs offers rigorous historical insights for present policy""--  ""This book provides a framework for defining successful diplomacy and implementing it in diverse contexts""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By reconstructing Roman political thinking about liberty against the background of Classical and Hellenistic thought, it excavates two distinct intellectual traditions on the means allowing for the preservation and the loss of libertas. Considering the interplay of these traditions in the political debates of the first century BC, Dr Arena offers a significant reinterpretation of the political struggles of the time as well as a radical reappraisal of the role played by the idea of liberty in the practice of politics. She argues that, as a result of its uses in rhetorical debates, libertas underwent a form of conceptual change at the end of the Republic and came to legitimize a new course of politics, which led progressively to the transformation of the whole political system""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But that is only a small part of its complicated and complicit performance history. In this sophisticated and historically grounded analysis, anthropologist Jennifer Robertson draws from over a decade of fieldwork and archival research to explore how the Revue illuminates discourses of sexual politics, nationalism, imperialism, and popular culture in twentieth-century Japan.  The Revue was founded in 1913 as a novel counterpart to the all-male Kabuki theater. Tracing the contradictory meanings of Takarazuka productions over time, with special attention to the World War II period, Robertson illuminates the intricate web of relationships among managers, directors, actors, fans, and social critics, whose clashes and compromises textured the theater and the wider society in colorful and complex ways.  Using Takarazuka as a key to understanding the ""logic"" of everyday life in Japan and placing the Revue squarely in its own social, historical, and cultural context, she challenges both the stereotypes of ""the Japanese"" and the Eurocentric notions of gender performance and sexuality.

How did the constitutional system shape the expansion and governance of American empire? American Imperialism and the State offers a new perspective on these questions by recasting American imperial governance as an episode of state building. Colin Moore argues that the empire was decisively shaped by the efforts of colonial state officials to achieve greater autonomy in the face of congressional obstruction, public indifference, and limitations on administrative capacity. Drawing on extensive archival research, the book focuses principally upon four cases of imperial governance--Hawai'i, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti--to highlight the essential tension between American mass democracy and imperial expansion""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Evaluation and assessment to date is largely focused on reviewing government documents, doing little to alleviate the distorted perspectives from which we vainly attempt to invoke workable policy.     In contrast to much of the current literature, Homeland Security Handbook takes a sober, analytical look at the policies, results, and lessons learned in what is still a nascent field. This comprehensive reference considers the myriad factors, implications, and ramifications involved with the practical and effective protection of our safety.     Dividing contributions into five sections, this book-    Provides an overview and historical      perspective of the worldwide threat of terrorism and debates the necessity      and danger of highly-centralized government response   Explores specific threats to      homeland security including the exploitation of our own vulnerabilities.      It explores the insidious effect of psycho-terrorism and challenges the      economic and military wisdom of launching armies against a nation-less and      nebulous threat   Offers practical, reasoned advice      from practitioners and academic experts on planning, preparedness,      prevention, and recovery  Reviews supporting case studies from      local and foreign governmental response to security and border control  Quantifies the cost of homeland      security in terms of funding, as well as the hardships incurred by rash      and biased actions     Conscious of the multi-faceted nature of the problem, the editor combines theory and practice to address concerns in border and transportation security, emergency preparedness and response, and infrastructure protection.

Sustainable Modernity,Nina Witoszek,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL20927050W,/authors/OL4061093A/Nina_Witoszek,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English,"The Open Access version of this book, available at https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781351765633, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 license.                 In the 21st century, Norway, Denmark and Sweden remain the icons of fair societies, with high economic productivity and quality of life. But they are also an enigma in a cultural-evolutionary sense: though by no means following the same socio-economic formula, they are all cases of a ""non-hubristic"", socially sustainable modernity that puzzles outside observers.               Using Nordic welfare states as its laboratory, Sustainable Modernity combines evolutionary and socio-cultural perspectives to illuminate the mainsprings of what the authors call the ""well-being society"". The main contention is that the Nordic uniqueness is not merely the outcome of one particular set of historical institutional or political arrangements, or sheer historical luck; rather, the high welfare creation inherent in the Nordic model has been predicated on a long and durable tradition of social cooperation, which has interacted with global competitive forces. Hence the socially sustainable Nordic modernity should be approached as an integrated and tightly orchestrated ecosystem based on a complex interplay of cooperative and competitive strategies within and across several domains: normative-cultural, socio-political and redistributive. The key question is: Can the Nordic countries uphold the balance of competition and cooperation and reproduce their resilience in the age of globalization, cultural collisions, the digital economy, the fragmentation of the work/life division, and often intrusive EU regulation?        With contributors providing insights from the humanities, the social sciences and evolutionary science, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of political science, sociology, history, institutiona   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Daniel Beer explores the massive penal colony that became an incubator for the radicalism of revolutionaries who would one day rule Russia""--  ""It was known as 'the vast prison without a roof.' From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the Russian Revolution, the tsars exiled more than one million prisoners and their families beyond the Ural Mountains to Siberia.  Daniel Beer illuminates both the brutal realities of this inhuman system and the tragic and inspiring fates of those who endured it. Here are the vividly told stories of petty criminals and mass murderers, bookish radicals and violent terrorists, fugitives and bounty hunters, and the innocent women and children who followed their husbands and fathers into exile. Siberia was intended to serve not only as a dumping ground for criminals but also as a colony. Just as exile would purge Russia of its villains so too would it purge villains of their vices. In theory, Russia's most unruly criminals would be transformed into hardy frontiersmen and settlers. But in reality, the system peopled Siberia with an army of destitute and desperate vagabonds who visited a plague of crime on the indigenous population.  Even the aim of securing law and order in the rest of the Empire met with disaster: Expecting Siberia also to provide the ultimate quarantine against rebellion, the tsars condemned generations of republicans, nationalists and socialists to oblivion thousands of kilometers from Moscow. Over the nineteenth century, however, these political exiles transformed Siberia's mines, settlements and penal forts into a virtual laboratory of revolution. Exile became the defining experience for the men and women who would one day rule the Soviet Union. Unearthing a treasure trove of new archival evidence, this masterly and original work tells the epic story of Russia's struggle to govern its prison continent and Siberia's own decisive influence on the political forces of the modern world."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wright Mills are far more accurate views about power in America than those of Mills's opponents. Dr. Domhoff shows how and why coalitions within the power elite have involved themselves in such policy issues as the Social Security Act (1935) and the Employment Act (1946), and how the National Labor Relations Act (1935) could pass against the opposition of every major corporation. The book descri bes how experts worked closely with the power elite in shaping the plansfor a post-World War II world economic order, in good part realized during the past 30 years. Arguments are advanced that the fat cats who support the Democrats cannot be understood in terms of narrow self-interest, and that moderate conservatives dominated policy-making under Reagan.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet the many complex challenges posed by crises in places such as Kosovo, Libya, Syria and Ukraine have illustrated the continuing failure of such normative arguments to transform the practice of international relations. This book responds to these theoretical and practical problems by drawing a sharp distinction between two strands of thought on the concept of sovereignty, one focused on power and the other on moral and legal responsibilities. Through analysis of case studies of Kosovo and Libya and consideration of the concept of the world state, the weaknesses and dangers of normative claims in support of humanitarian intervention are exposed and analysed""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Combining complexity theory and the notion of signature with case studies, it argues that political processes need to be understood within their social and cultural contexts. It thus develops the idea of enduring conflict, referring to both the enduring nature of political conflict and the endurance of people in conflict-ridden societies, looking at countries involved in conflict transformation, such as Northern Ireland, Cambodia, Indonesia, and South Africa. Examining debates around trauma, memory, and reconciliation, the work shows how conflicts are so socially and culturally ingrained and protracted that political agreements alone cannot bring substantive change. In addition, key texts, such as peace agreements, along with interviews of politicians, participants, and NGOs help identify the conditions under which notions like peace, democracy, and conflict resolution can even be conceived - let alone implemented. This innovative text is a significant contribution to the literature as it highlights the limitations of conflict resolution strategies and identifies the issues that pertain to conflicts throughout global politics. Written in an accessible manner, it will be highly attractive to students in conflict processes, peace studies, and international relations theory""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the 1960s, a rift developed between the Old America and the New America that resulted in a populist backlash that ultimately elected Donald Trump in 2016. Schneider describes an American populism that is economically progressive and culturally conservative. Liberals are attacked as cultural elitists (""limousine liberals""), and conservatives as economic elitists (""country club conservatives""). Trump is the complete populist package. He embraces social populism (anti-immigrant), economic populism (anti-free trade), and isolationism (""America First""). Standoff examines a number of hard-fought elections to show us how we got to Trump. He asserts the power of public opinion. He points to the public that draws the line on abortion and affirmative action. He shows why an intense minority cancels a majority on gun control, immigration, small government, and international interests. Standoff tells us why fifty years of presidential contests have often been confounding. It takes us inside to watch how and why Americans pull the lever, how they choose their issues and select their leaders. It is usually values that trump economics.

It threatens to become self-fulfilling. In this trailblazing new book, award-winning author Robert W. McChesney argues that the weight of the present is blinding people to the changing nature and the tremendous possibilities of the historical moment we inhabit. In Blowing the Roof Off the Twenty-First Century, he uses a sophisticated political economic analysis to delineate the recent trajectory of capitalism and its ongoing degeneration. In exciting new research McChesney reveals how notions of democratic media are becoming central to activists around the world seeking to establish post-capitalist democracies. Blowing the Roof Off the Twenty-First Century also takes a fresh look at recent progressive political campaigns in the United States. While conveying complex ideas in a lively and accessible manner, McChesney demonstrates a very different and far superior world is not only necessary, but possible""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The year 1983 was an extremely dangerous one--more dangerous than 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the United States, President Reagan vastly increased defense spending, described the Soviet Union as an 'evil empire,' and launched the 'Star Wars' Strategic Defense Initiative to shield the country from incoming missiles. Seeing all this, Yuri Andropov, the paranoid Soviet leader, became convinced that the US really meant to attack the Soviet Union and he put the KGB on high alert, looking for signs of an imminent nuclear attack. When a Soviet plane shot down a Korean civilian jet, Reagan described it as 'a crime against humanity.' And Moscow grew increasingly concerned about America's language and behavior. Would they attack? The temperature rose fast. In November the West launched a wargame exercise, codenamed 'Abel Archer,' that looked to the Soviets like the real thing. With Andropov's finger inching ever closer to the nuclear button, the world was truly on the brink. This is an extraordinary and largely unknown Cold War story of spies and double agents, of missiles being readied, intelligence failures, misunderstandings, and the panic of world leaders. With access to hundreds of astonishing new documents, Taylor Downing tells for the first time the gripping but true story of how near the world came to nuclear war in 1983.""--Publisher description.

Set-theoretic methods for the social sciences,Carsten Q.

In virtually all social science fields, statements about social phenomena can be framed in terms of set relations, and using set-theoretic methods to investigate these statements is therefore highly valuable. This book guides readers through the basic principles of set theory and then on to the applied practices of QCA. It provides a thorough understanding of basic and advanced issues in set-theoretic methods together with tricks of the trade, software handling and exercises. Most arguments are introduced using examples from existing research. The use of QCA is increasing rapidly and the application of set-theory is both fruitful and still widely misunderstood in current empirical comparative social research. This book provides an invaluable guide to these methods for researchers across the social sciences""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Australia,Haydn Aarons,political_science,,/works/OL20932956W,/authors/OL8012680A/Haydn_Aarons,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  ANU Press|Language English,"The latter years of the first decade of the twenty-first century were characterised by an enormous amount of challenge and change to Australia and Australians. Australia?s part in these challenges and changes is borne of our domestic and global ties, our orientation towards ourselves and others, and an ever increasing awareness of the interdependency of our world. Challenges and changes such as terrorism, climate change, human rights, community breakdown, work and livelihood, and crime are not new but they take on new variations and impact on us in different ways in times such as these. In this volume we consider these recent challenges and changes and how Australians themselves feel about them under three themes: identity, fear and governance. These themes suitably capture the concerns of Australians in times of such change. Identity is our sense of ourselves and how others see us. How is this affected by the increased presence of religious diversity, especially Islamic communities, and increased awareness of moral and political obligations towards Indigenous Australians? How is it affected by our curious but changing relationship with Asia? Fear is an emotional reaction to particular changes and challenges and produces particular responses from individuals, politicians, communities and nations alike; fear of crime, fear of terrorism and fear of change are all considered in this volume.

To dare more boldly,John C.

To Dare More Boldly provides those ways, telling the story of the rise of political risk analysis, both as a discipline and a lucrative high-stakes industry that guides the strategic decisions of corporations and governments around the world. It assesses why recent predictions have gone so wrong and boldly puts forward ten analytical commandments that can stand the test of time. Written by one of the field's leading practitioners, this incisive book derives these indelible rules of the game from a wide-ranging and entertaining survey of world history. John Hulsman looks at examples as seemingly unconnected as the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Third Crusade, the Italian Renaissance, America's founders, Napoleon, the Battle of Gettysburg, the British Empire, the Kaiser's Germany, the breakup of the Beatles, Charles Manson, and Deng Xiaoping's China. Hulsman makes sense of yesterday's world, and in doing so provides an invaluable conceptual tool kit for navigating today's. To Dare More Boldly creatively explains why political risk analysis is vital for business and political leaders alike, and authoritatively establishes the analytical rules of thumb that practitioners need to do it effectively. --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Die Studie zeigt, daß der soziale Mietwohnungsbau nicht in der Lage ist, einkommensschwache Haushalte und soziale Randgruppen effizient mit Wohnraum zu versorgen. Einzelne Korrekturmaßnahmen wie beispielsweise die Fehlbelegungsabgabe können keine Abhilfe schaffen. Auch die 1994 eingeführte einkommensorientierte Förderung weist erhebliche Probleme auf, bietet jedoch Ansatzpunkte für eine Neukonzeption des Fördersystems: Zentrales Instrument der sozialen Sicherung des Wohnens ist dabei ein leicht modifiziertes Wohngeld. Es wird flankiert durch den Erwerb kommunaler Belegungsrechte im Wohnungsbestand für solche Haushalte, die nicht aufgrund fehlender Mietzahlungsfähigkeit, sondern wegen persönlicher Eigenschaften auf dem Wohnungsmarkt benachteiligt werden.

It designates a stance which permits conflicts over beliefs and practices to persist while at the same time defusing them, because it is based on reasons for coexistence in conflict - that is, in continuing dissension. A critical examination of the concept makes clear, however, that its content and evaluation are profoundly contested matters and thus that the concept itself stands in conflict. For some, toleration was and is an expression of mutual respect in spite of far-reaching differences, for others, a condescending, potentially repressive attitude and practice. Rainer Forst analyses these conflicts by reconstructing the philosophical and political discourse of toleration since antiquity. He demonstrates the diversity of the justifications and practices of toleration from the Stoics and early Christians to the present day and develops a systematic theory which he tests in discussions of contemporary conflicts over toleration""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sie erzählen über ihre Erfahrungen, machen deutlich, was sie an ihren Gruppen fasziniert: „Wir besprechen Probleme, die uns im alltäglichen Leben begegnen. Wir versuchen, gegenseitig zu helfen, zu unterstützen. Das ist nicht nur im politischen Bereich, sondern auch im privaten Bereich so“, berichtet Rüdiger.  Das Buch zeigt: Jugendliche sind enttäuscht! „Welche Perspektive habe ich? — „Was kann meinem Leben einen Sinn geben?“ — „Wo finde ich Orientierung?“ — „Was kann ich machen?“ — „Wo finde ich Freunde, eine Gruppe?“ – „Wo werde ich gefordert?“ — „Wer kümmert sich um meine Probleme?“ — „Was kann mir die Gesellschaft bieten?“ — Fragen, Fragen, Fragen, doch wer gibt die Antwort? Politiker, Jugendorganisationen, Lehrer, Gewerkschafter, Eltern oder Kirche? Oder Rechtsextreme, die einfache „Lösungen“ parat haben, die „Schuldigen“ beim Namen nennen, mit Kameradschaft und dergleichen mehr locken?  „Verführte“ und „Verführer“ geben Auskunft: Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, ehemals „Chef“ einer inzwischen verbotenen Wehrsportgruppe, Vorstandsmitglieder der „Jungen Nationaldemokraten“, Michael Kühnen, der als Rädelsführer des rechtsextremen Terrors gilt, Gernot Morig, der „Bundesführer“ vom „Bund Heimattreuer Jugend“ und viele einfache Mitglieder verschiedener rechtsextremer Jugendgruppen.  Dieses Buch ergründet das „subjektive Moment“, warum Jugendliche in rechtsextremen Organisationen landen. Denn wer den Rechtsextremismus wirksam bekämpfen will, muß auch seine Anhänger kennen. Es ist erforderlich, sie zu verstehen, ohne das, was sie vertreten, zu akzeptieren. Um Gegenstrategien entwickeln zu können, ist „Rechtsextreme Jugendliche“ unentbehrlich.

Links is verantwoordelijk voor een almaar uitdijend en steeds meer geld verslindend overheidsapparaat dat het particulier initiatief verstikt. Links is veel te soft tegen allerlei profiteurs en klaplopers, vooral als die van buitenlandse afkomst zijn. Hoewel in de loop der jaren nogal wat linkse politici en intellectuelen het zicht op de werkelijkheid zijn kwijtgeraakt, correspondeert de werkelijkheid evenmin met dit zwaar overtrokken beeld van 'links'. Daarom wordt in deze essays onderzocht in hoeverre links schuldig is aan de problemen waarmee Nederland kampt. Bovendien wordt nagegaan in hoeverre het rechtse populisme en het intellectuele conservatisme werkbare alternatieven zijn, en welke rol linkse intellectuelen zouden kunnen spelen.

This ""crisis of authority"" was prompted by growing opposition in the Americas to the neo-liberal reforms that had been promoted by Washington since the 1980s. Marcel Nelson demonstrates how the FTAA became the focal point of this opposition from a growing chorus of leftist heads of state in Latin America to the detriment of the negotiations. A neo-Gramscian theoretical framework will be used to frame the manner in which the ""crisis of authority"" came to the fore in the states of the Americas and in the institutional structure established to negotiate the FTAA.

Against this tide of hysteria, Pilar Marrero reveals how damaging this rise in malice toward immigrants is not only to the individuals, but to our country as a whole. Marrero explores the rise in hate groups and violence targeting the foreign-born from the 1986 Immigration Act to the increasing legislative madness of laws like Arizona's SB1070 which allows law officers to demand documentation from any individual with ""reasonable suspicion"" of citizenship, essentially encouraging states and municipalities to form their own self-contained nation-states devoid of immigrants. Assessing the current status quo of immigration, Marrero reveals the economic drain these ardent anti-immigration policies have as they deplete the nation of an educated work force, undermine efforts to stabilize tax bases and social security, and turn the American Dream from a time honored hallmark of the nation into an unattainable fantasy for all immigrants of the present and future""--  ""A timely look at the evolution of US immigration policy and how the increasingly hostile anti-immigrant climate is detrimental to our nation's economic well-being""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book is not an attempt to give the reader a comprehensive history of a reluctant America's entry into World War I.

For decades Martha C. Nussbaum has been an acclaimed scholar and humanist, earning dozens of honors for her books and essays. In The Monarchy of Fear she turns her attention to the current political crisis that has polarized American since the 2016 election. Although today's atmosphere is marked by partisanship, divisive rhetoric, and the inability of two halves of the country to communicate with one another, Nussbaum focuses on what so many pollsters and pundits have overlooked. She sees a simple truth at the heart of the problem: the political is always emotional. Globalization has produced feelings of powerlessness in millions of people in the West. That sense of powerlessness bubbles into resentment and blame. Blame of immigrants. Blame of Muslims. Blame of other races. Blame of cultural elites. While this politics of blame is exemplified by the election of Donald Trump and the vote for Brexit, Nussbaum argues it can be found on all sides of the political spectrum, left or right. Drawing on a mix of historical and contemporary examples, from classical Athens to the musical Hamilton, The Monarchy of Fear untangles this web of feelings and provides a roadmap of where to go next.""--Amazon.com.

"A HISTORY OF THE EDMONTON GENERAL HOSPITAL: 1895-1970, ""BE FAITHFUL TO THE DUTIES OF YOUR CALLING"" (NURSING, GREY NUNS, ALBERTA, CANADA)",Pauline Paul,political_science,First published in 1994,/works/OL8545879W,/authors/OL2863356A/Pauline_Paul,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 499,"The purpose of this study was to trace the historical development of the Edmonton General Hospital (EGH) between 1895 and 1970. The focus of this project was on the development of nursing services at that hospital. It was acknowledged from the outset that studying the development of these services could not be done without taking into account other aspects of the history of the EGH including the place it occupied in Edmonton and Alberta. Thus, a concerted effort was made to write a context-bound history as reflected in the selected research questions: How did the role of nurses change at the EGH between 1895 and 1970? What was the impact of the Grey Nuns philosophy on patient care delivery and policy making at the EGH? What evidence is there of the impact of societal events on the EGH between 1895 and 1970? What changes at the EGH, between 1895 and 1970 can be attributed to the influence of federal and/or provincial government policies? What were the effects on the hospital of the link between the Grey Nuns and the Franco-Albertan community? Historical methods were used to answer these questions and primary and secondary data were collected, analyzed and organized into a coherent narrative. The results of this study show that nursing and the roles played by nurses greatly changed over the 76 years under investigation and that the hospital evolved from a family like structure to a large quasi-bureaucratic organization. Evidence also indicates that the Grey Nuns who owned and administered the hospital were resourceful women who had the ability to surpass a multitude of problems and difficulties. The results of this investigation show that the fact that the Grey Nuns were Catholic and primarily French Canadian influenced their outlook on life and the way in which they saw their role in the hospital field. Finally, the results resented in this dissertation show that a number of events and government policies influenced the destiny of the institution.

POLICY MAKING: STATE REGULATION OF NURSING PRACTICE. A STUDY OF THE NORTH CAROLINA BOARD OF NURSING (POLICYMAKING),Elizabeth Ann Mcgoldrick Trought,political_science,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278490W,/authors/OL5367891A/Elizabeth_Ann_Mcgoldrick_Trought,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 236,"Occupational licensure is the traditional method of governmental regulation of the quality of services provided by professionals. In 1903, North Carolina (NC) became the first state to pass legislation regulating nursing. In 1981 NC became the first state to have a directly elected Board of Nursing empowered to administer its Nursing Practice Act.  The purpose of this study was to explore the policy making process of the NC Board of Nursing. Specifically the research questions were: (1) How is policy made by the North Carolina Board of Nursing? (2) What are the factors which influence the policy making of this state board? and (3) What effect does an elected professional nursing board have on policy making?.  The study was conducted within the theoretical framework of critical social theory, using a multi-source case study methodology. Ideological issues explored while addressing the research questions revolved around the theoretical assumptions and research findings found in the political economic literature on occupational regulation, and the nursing and professionalizing literature.  The study findings revealed that the NC Board of Nursing has a policy making process with marked similarities to that of a nonprofit voluntary association. The dynamics of Board members, the Board's professional staff, individual practitioners, and interest groups are influential in the policy making process. The effects of an elected professional nursing board remain somewhat enigmatic.  Political economic theories were nonexplanatory for this example of regulatory policy making. Although professionalizing values and beliefs were apparent in Board members and professional staff the findings did not confirm attempts to convert these views into policy actions. The operational structure of the Board, its perceived legal parameters, and its commitment to the ""protection of the public"", seemed to counter balance and even negate professionalizing policy initiatives.

The RMP uses experienced mothers or paraprofessionals similar in race and socio-economic status to the participating teenagers. These persons are trained to assist pregnant adolescents and teen parents with nonmedical dimensions of pregnancy and child care. They recruit teens into the RMP, encouraging them to get early prenatal care. Resource Mothers provide teen mothers and their families with practical help as needed, and help increase community awareness of the infant mortality and adolescent pregnancy issues.  This analysis compares selected pregnancy outcomes of participants in the RMP with pregnancy outcomes of participants in an alternate program, young mothers who receive traditional prenatal care without structured psycho-social support, and with teens who receive no prenatal care. The pregnancy outcomes of the total study population and subgroups also are compared with national, state, regional and local low birth weight rates, and high infant mortality rates. Study findings show that premature deliveries and low birth weight babies are lower among adolescent mothers, at increased risk for delivering low weight infants, by using a specialized support program involving lay home-visitors who share socio-economic characteristics of the adolescents' families or a multi-disciplinary program with home visiting.

A household name for his reality-television show and his tawdry tabloid history, he has connected with an underappreciated strain of right-wing populists by focusing his fire on a single issue: immigration.  In this Broadside, Kevin D. Williamson takes a hard look at the Trump phenomenon and the failures of the national Republican leadership - and defects in our national character - that gave it life. Trump may or may not be in the race for the long haul, but in either case, Trumpism will remain a force""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Maar ook van toenemende politieke polarisering en van de invraagstelling van de mensenrechten en de democratie. In die context voelden intellectuelen zich niet enkel geroepen om deel te nemen aan het maatschappelijke debat, zij koesterden ook de ambitie om een welbepaalde rol te spelen in de samenleving. De idealen die ze voor zichzelf en voor de toekomst van de maatschappij nastreefden, waren nauw met elkaar verbonden. De spanning tussen deze idealen en de concrete verwezenlijking ervan staat centraal in dit boek. Het is een verhaal van rivaliserende overtuigingen die internationalisten, communistische intellectuelen, compagnons de route, humanitaire socialisten, sociale hervormers, pacifisten en cultuurcritici tegenover elkaar plaatst. Uit deze confrontaties komen convergenties, allianties en breuken naar voren tussen intellectuele groepjes en netwerken, tussentijdschriftredacties, verenigingen en actiegroepen.

The latest mass communication advances demonstrate that we live in an increasingly media-centric world. The chapters include theoretical and empirical studies that shed light on the meaning of this development. The trajectory of people?s move to electronic communication is a global phenomenon affecting their daily life. Does this trend aid or impede democracy? Is there an emerging digital divide contributing to an increasing gap between the rich and poor people and nations? The four parts of this book explore various aspects of political socialization and its relationship with different media, including print, broadcasting, and the Internet.

But Paulson had no idea that a year later, he would find himself at the very epicenter of the world's most cataclysmic financial crisis since the Great Depression. Major institutions including Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup, among others-all steeped in rich, longstanding tradition-literally teetered at the edge of collapse. Panic ensnared international markets. Worst of all, the credit crisis spread to all parts of the U.S. economy and grew more ominous with each passing day, destroying jobs across America and undermining the financial security millions of families had spent their lifetimes building.   This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime economic nightmare. Events no one had thought possible were happening in quick succession, and people all over the globe were terrified that the continuing downward spiral would bring unprecedented chaos. All eyes turned to the United States Treasury Secretary to avert the disaster.  This, then, is Hank Paulson's first-person account. From the man who was in the very middle of this perfect economic storm, ON THE BRINK is Paulson's fast-paced retelling of the key decisions that had to be made with lightning speed. Paulson puts the reader in the room for all the intense moments as he addressed urgent market conditions, weighed critical decisions, and debated policy and economic considerations with of all the notable players-including the CEOs of top Wall Street firms as well as Ben Bernanke, Timothy Geithner, Sheila Bair, Nancy Pelosi, Barney Frank, presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain, and then-President George W. Bush.  More than an account about numbers and credit risks gone bad, ON THE BRINK is an extraordinary story about people and politics-all brought together during the world's impending financial Armageddon.

This book argues that they are and that the reason is growing polarization of worldviews - what guides people's view of right and wrong and good and evil. These differences in worldview are rooted in what Marc J. Hetherington and Jonathan D. Weiler describe as authoritarianism. They show that differences of opinion concerning the most provocative issues on the contemporary issue agenda - about race, gay marriage, illegal immigration, and the use of force to resolve security problems - reflect differences in individuals' levels of authoritarianism. This makes authoritarianism an especially compelling explanation of contemporary American politics. Events and strategic political decisions have conspired to make all these considerations more salient. The authors demonstrate that the left and the right have coalesced around these opposing worldviews, which has provided politics with more incandescent hues than before.""--BOOK JACKET.

Smart Grid Security: An End-to-End View of Security in the New Electrical Grid explores the important techniques, challenges, and forces that will shape how we achieve a secure twenty-first century electric grid.Following an overview of the components of the Smart Grid, the book delves into the evolution of security standards and regulations and examines ways in which the Smart Grid might be regulated. The authors discuss the technical details about how metering technology is being implemented and the likely threats and vulnerabilities that utilities will face. They address the home area network (HAN) and examine distribution and transmission the foundation for the delivery of electricity, along with distributed generation, micro-grids, and operations.The book explores future concepts such as energy storage and the use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs ) in addition to the concomitant risk for fraud and manipulation with stored energy. Consumer-related issues are discussed as they pertain to emerging ways of receiving and generating energy. The book examines dysfunctions ranging from inadvertent outages to cyber-attack and presents recommendations on how to respond to these incidents. It concludes with speculation of future cyber-security challenges and discusses new ways that the grid can be defended, such as better key management and protection.Written in a style rigorous enough for the practitioner yet accessible to a broad audience, this comprehensive volume covers a topic that is becoming more critical to industry and consumers everywhere""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

She has reflected upon what made the transition so effective, and wonders if it could be a model for future incoming and outgoing administrations. This book focuses on the preparations made by President Bush's transition team as well as those by Senators Obama and McCain as one administration exited and the other entered the White House. Using this recent transition as a lens through which to examine the presidential transition process, Kumar simultaneously outlines the congressional legislation that paved the way for this distinctive transition and interweaves comparative examples from previous administrative transitions going back to Truman-to-Eisenhower. She evaluates the early and continuing actions by the General Services Administration to plan and set up transition offices; the work on financial disclosure issues handled by the Office of Government Ethics; and the Office of Management and Budget's preparatory work. In this fascinating historical and contemporary vivisection of presidential transitions, Kumar maps out, in the words of former NSA advisor General James L. Jones, the characteristics of a smooth ""glide path"" for presidential campaign staffs and their administrations""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From 1789 to 1958, the leaders of four republics, two absolute monarchies, two constitutional monarchies, two imperiums, and a fascist regime all struggled and ultimately failed to rule France. Although a myriad of reasons explain the emergence and collapse of each political system before 1958, one underlines all--the French failed to master the art of power. As a master of power, Charles de Gaulle appears to have broken France's bloody cycle of the rise and fall of regimes. He did so largely through the system he created in 1958 and the policies that he asserted as president until he resigned in 1969. De Gaulle's legacy is the Fifth Republic, which has flourished for over five decades and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This book asks: What is the art of power? What is the art of French power? How did Charles de Gaulle understand and assert power in his lifetime? How well or poorly have his successors wielded the art of French power in asserting national interests as they defined them? ""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Innovative activities include taking detailed plant cell photographs through a microscope using a disposable camera; building a rocket engine out of aluminum foil, paper clips, and kitchen matches; and constructing a geodesic dome out of gumdrops and barbecue skewers. Organized by scientific topic, each chapter includes explanations of the physics, chemistry, biology, or mathematics behind the projects. Most of the devices can be built using common household products or components available at hardware or electronic stores, and each experiment contains illustrated step-by-step instructions with photographs and diagrams that make construction easy.

A native of the former Soviet Union, he lived as an exchange student in North Korea in the 1980s. He has studied it for his entire career, using his fluency in Korean and personal contacts to build a rich, nuanced understanding. In The Real North Korea, Lankov substitutes cold, clear analysis for the overheated rhetoric surrounding this opaque police state. After providing an accessible history of the nation, he turns his focus to what North Korea is, what its leadership thinks, and how its people cope with living in such an oppressive and poor place. He argues that North Korea is not irrational, and nothing shows this better than its continuing survival against all odds. A living political fossil, it clings to existence in the face of limited resources and a zombie economy, manipulating great powers despite its weakness. Its leaders are not ideological zealots or madmen, but perhaps the best practitioners of Machiavellian politics that can be found in the modern world. Even though they preside over a failed state, they have successfully used diplomacy-including nuclear threats-to extract support from other nations. But while the people in charge have been ruthless and successful in holding on to power, Lankov goes on to argue that this cannot continue forever, since the old system is slowly falling apart. In the long run, with or without reform, the regime is unsustainable. Lankov contends that reforms, if attempted, will trigger a dramatic implosion of the regime. They will not prolong its existence. Based on vast expertise, this book reveals how average North Koreans live, how their leaders rule, and how both survive""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Mohebi focuses especially on reformist public intellectuals as agents of change, especially effective because of the role they played in introducing new ideas to a wider constituency, and examines how different reformist intellectuals used civil society to craft their vision of Iran's socio-political future. Mohebi also examines how conservative figures with different underlying values and political agendas appropriated civil society for their own ends. The book argues that, although the concept of civil society may be deployed to serve conflicting objectives, its lasting legacy is pluralism and an opening up of the public sphere""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Their collective aim (in the words of the editors) is ""to articulate a new conception of Asian-American racial identity, its heterogeneity, hybridity, and multiplicity-concepts that have after all underpinned the Asian-American moniker from its very inception. Q & A approaches matters of identity from a variety of points of view and academic disciplines in order to explore the multiple crossings of race and ethnicity with sexuality and gender. Drawing together the work of visual artists, fiction writers, community organizers, scholars, and participants in roundtable discussions, the collection gathers an array of voices and experiences that represent the emerging communities of a queer Asian-America. Collectively, these contributors contend that Asian-American studies needs to be more attentive to issues of sexuality and that queer studies   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, in the Italian general elections of February 2013, despite still largely being considered a small protest movement, the party gained the undisputed role of leading political actor gaining just under 9 million votes and sending 163 Deputies and Senators to the Italian parliament. The birth and rapid rise of the Five Star Movement represents an electoral earthquake with no parallels in Italy and the whole of post-1945 Western Europe and a phenomenon likely to shape the Italian political scene for many years to come. Drawing on an extensive array of data and face-to-face interviews, this volume offers an empirically grounded explanation of the surprising electoral success of the Five Star Movement and presents a realistic picture of this party in its manifold aspects: organisational structure, communication style, linkages with civil society, ideological nature and positioning in the Italian political system.

Up until that moment, Dash had lived a typical Hollywood life: Best known for playing Dionne in the 1995 teen classic Clueless, Dash had close friends in the upper echelons of the movie and music industries-and she had an Obama bumper sticker on the back of her BMW. But in 2012, sick of being disappointed by the Obama White House and growing more certain of her conservative beliefs, Dash endorsed Mitt Romney for president on Twitter. The backlash was swift and brutal. In There Goes My Social Life, Stacey Dash explains how she became a conservative, sharing incredible stories of her rough upbringing in South Bronx and her tumultuous Hollywood career to movingly illustrate her strong opinions about the value of a good education, the importance of family, the inanity of political correctness, and the power of personal responsibility""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Instead, it takes a long, judicious view of political change in the Arab world, beginning with the first Awakening in the nineteenth century and extending into future decades when--if the dream is realized--a new Arab world defined by pluralism and tolerance will emerge. Marwan Muasher, former foreign minister of Jordan, asserts that all sides--the United States, Europe, Israel, and Arab governments alike--were deeply misguided in their thinking about Arab politics and society when the turmoil of the Arab Spring erupted. He explains the causes of the unrest, tracing them back to the first Arab Awakening, and warns of the forces today that threaten the success of the Second Arab Awakening, ignited in December 2010. Hope rests with the new generation and its commitment to tolerance, diversity, the peaceful rotation of power, and inclusive economic growth, Muasher maintains. He calls on the West to rethink political Islam and the Arab-Israeli conflict, and he discusses steps all parties can take to encourage positive state-building in the freshly unsettled Arab world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

En el bicentenario del nacimiento de Alexis de Tocqueville» organizadas por el Instituto Cánovas del Castillo de la Fundación FAES los días 12 y 13 de diciembre de 2005 en el Hotel Miguel Ángel de Madrid. El fin primordial del Instituto Cánovas del Castillo es la investigación y difusión de la historia del pensamiento liberal-conservador y, dentro de ese objetivo, organizó unas jornadas de reflexión y homenaje a este gran pensador de la libertad y la democracia.  La obra de Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-1859) es lectura indispensable para el lector contemporáneo. Nadie mejor que él ha sabido explicar cómo bajo las apariencias de la democracia puede ocultarse un tipo nuevo de despotismo blando, pacífico, muelle, aparentemente racional, en el que los apáticos habitantes salen de su sopor consumista un instante cada cierto número de años para elegir a sus tiranos.  No existe mejor alegato a favor de una democracia de ciudadanos iguales, libres y responsables, conscientes de los peligros de un poder político cada vez más inquisitorial, protector y previsor que La democracia en América. En sus páginas se describe el ideal de una democracia que conjuga la igualdad y solidaridad con la necesidad del debate, la discusión, el desorden que provoca la búsqueda permanente de la libertad.  Para Tocqueville, lo más trágico es la tendencia a que los seres humanos, cada vez más individualistas, inmersos en sus quehaceres diarios, renuncien ellos mismos a defender sus libertades. Alexis de Tocqueville nos ha enseñado que la libertad no puede obtenerse más que a través de la acción diaria de los ciudadanos en la vida política y social, de la constante vigilancia y control de la acción de un Estado que se pretende eterno vigilante y protector, omnisciente y paternal y que considera a sus súbditos en una eterna infancia.

Kant is often thought to be highly reductionistic with regard to religion - as though religion simply provides the unsophisticated with colourful representations of moral lessons that reason alone could grasp. James DiCenso's rich and innovative discussion shows how Kant's theory of religion in fact emerges directly from his epistemology, ethics and political theory, and how it serves his larger political and ethical projects of restructuring institutions and modifying political attitudes towards greater autonomy. It also illustrates the continuing relevance of Kant's ideas for addressing issues of religion and politics that remain pressing in the contemporary world, such as just laws, transparency in the public sphere and other ethical and political concerns. The book will be valuable for a wide range of readers who are interested in Kant's thought""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book includes a mix of article types: theory, lecture, research, battlefield journalism, investigative reporting, as well as excerpts from international law and a military leadership manual""--Provided by publisher.  ""This book is a collection of recent and provocative articles by such influential figures as Noam Chomsky and Scott Atran. It presents a variety of perspectives and disciplines that critically examine significant ethical issues involved in the War on Terrorism. Concepts of terrorism, counterterrorism, and antiterrorism are explored within the context of how language frames and controls definition of the problem, potential solutions, viable actors, and outcomes. This book provides in-depth analyses of moral principles as applied to real-life events, as well as facts and ideas that are missing or underrepresented in the dominant narratives found in public discourse. The editors establish that there are viable nonviolent alternatives to the global war on terrorism and outline eight steps necessary to initiate a process of understanding and reconciliation that promises improved human security and sustainable peace""--Provided by publisher.

Kai Hafez's book overturns these arguments, contending that, despite its excesses, as a radical form of political opposition the movement plays a central role in the processes of democratization and modernization, and that these processes have direct parallels in the history and politics of the West. By analyzing the evolution of Christian democratization through the upheavals of the Reformation, colonisation, fascism, and totalitarianism, the book shows how radicalism and violence were constant accompaniments to political change, and that these components - despite assertions to the contrary - are still part of Western political culture to this day. In this way, the book draws hopeful conclusions about the potential for political, religious, and cultural transformation in the Islamic world, which is already exemplified by the cases of Turkey, Indonesia, and many parts of South Asia. The book marks an important development in the study of radical movements and their contribution to political change""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Called an enemy of the people,"" over the past year Piven has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign of hatred and disinformation, spearheaded by Beck.

For anyone who is skeptical of the World According to Beck, here is a guide to the ideas that Glenn fears most.  Who's Afraid of Frances Fox Piven? is a concise, accessible introduction to Piven's actual thinking (versus Beck's outrageous claims), from her early work on welfare rights and poor people's movements,"" written with her late husband Richard Cloward, through her influential examination of American voting habits, and her most recent work on the possibilities for a new movement for progressive reform.

He explores a range of themes in the political thought of Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau, at substantially greater length and depth than in his famous work of 1961, Man and Society. The lectures exemplify Plamenatz's view that repeated engagement with the texts of canonical thinkers can substantially enrich and expand our capacity for political reflection. Edited by Mark Philp and Zbigniew Pelczynski, the volume includes annotations to supply Plamenatz's sources and to refer readers to developments in their interpretation. A substantial introduction by Philp sets some of Plamenatz's concerns in the light of trends in recent scholarship, and illuminates the relevance of his work to the contemporary study of political thought""--  ""This volume presents lucid and insightful studies of three great figures from the history of political thought, by John Plamenatz (1912-1975), a leading political philosopher of his time.

Valerie J. Bunce and Sharon L. Wolchik compare these unexpected electoral breakthroughs with one another and with elections that had the more typical result of maintaining authoritarian rule. They draw three conclusions. First, the opposition was victorious because of the hard and creative work of a transnational network composed of local opposition and civil society groups, members of the international democracy assistance community, and graduates of successful electoral challenges to authoritarian rule in other countries. Second, the remarkable run of these upset elections reflected the ability of this network to diffuse an ensemble of innovative electoral strategies across state boundaries. Finally, elections can serve as a powerful mechanism for democratic change. This is especially the case when civil society is strong, the transfer of political power is through constitutional means, and opposition leaders win with small mandates""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In The Tunisian Tsunami John R. Bradley offers a sober counternarrative to this outlook. It is not liberalism, democracy, and pluralism that will emerge triumphant, he argues, but instead radical Islam. Bradley illustrates how, in a region awash with extremist Wahhabi ideology, intertribal rivalries, and Sunni-Shia divisions, the idea that liberal and progressive trends will prevail is little more than wishful thinking""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Decades ago, the idea of collective fear had a tangible face: the atom bomb. Today our shared anxiety has become far more complex and insidious, arising from tyranny, terrorism, and the invisible power of the ""quasi state."" As Wole Soyinka suggests, the climate of fear that has enveloped the world was sparked long before September 11, 2001. Rather, it can be traced to 1989, when a passenger plane was brought down by terrorists over the Republic of Niger. From Niger to lower Manhattan to Madrid to Beslan, this invisible threat has erased distinctions between citizens and soldiers; we're all potential targets now. In this seminal work, Soyinka explores the implications of this climate of fear: the conflict between power and freedom, the motives behind unthinkable acts of violence, and the meaning of human dignity. Fascinating and disturbing, Climate of Fear is a brilliant and defining work for our age.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Konzepte wie Rettungsfolter, gerechte Kriege, Ausnahme oder Sicherheit verweisen zugleich auf neue Rationalitäten staatlicher Gewalt. Der Band bietet interdisziplinäre Perspektiven auf historische Kontinuitäten und Brüche staatlicher Neuordnungen von Gewalt in der Gegenwart.

Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan seemed to think so when asked if she thought Congress possessed the constitutional power to force every American to ""eat three fruits and three vegetables every day."" Kagan laughed and said that while it sounded like ""a dumb law,"" that did not make it an unconstitutional one. In other words, if you don't like what your lawmakers have done, take your complaint to the ballot box, not to the courthouse. It was a classic case of judicial restraint, the idea that judges should defer to the will of the majority and refrain from striking down most democratically-enacted laws, even the really dumb ones. Judicial restraint and judicial activism cut across the political spectrum in surprising ways and make for some unusual bedfellows. Judicial restraint is not only a touchstone of the Progressive left, it is also a philosophy adopted by many members of the modern right. The growing camp of libertarians and free-market conservatives, however, has no patience with judicial restraint and little use for majority rule. Chief Justice Roberts' 2012 ruling in favor of Obama's health care law is an excellent case in point, though only the most recent. This is the story of two competing visions, each one with its own take on what role the government and the courts should play in our society, a fundamental debate that goes to the very heart of our constitutional system""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

This book studies the political transition from the Jagiellon dynasty to an elective monarchy as a political decision-making process in the 1560s and 1570s. It focuses on the Polish-Lithuanian nobility and clergy as 'king-makers' and their relationship with the monarchy. In addition, special attention is paid to the issue of transnational influences and the way in which the international state system affected events in Poland-Lithuania. Thus, this particular political transition is considered in the context of the great events of early modern Europe, such as the Reformation and state-formation processes""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

According to Michael Savage, OUR NATION IS IN REAL TROUBLE and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country. Not a war of bullets and blood - but one of commitment to freedom and courage of conviction. Michael Savage is convinced that we face more than just political differences now. He believes the split between right and left is possibly irreparable - unless we understand what's really happening and how we must act to stop it. Savage has been raising his voice for over 20 years as America's most outspoken and incisive talk radio host, and bestselling author. He argues that the situation is urgent and he is raising his voice even louder telling his Savage Truth in STOP THE COMING CIVIL WAR. Savage wants to galvanize every liberty-loving American and warn the enemies of our way of life - that, difficult as the path ahead may be, the time has come, the facts are clear, the line must be drawn. Savage cut his teeth exposing the political left's goals, tactics and actions as they attempt to tilt the country's axis ever closer to socialism. In these pages he lays out his belief that lefties don't want some to know ... connecting the dots between their many frightening moves hiding in plain sight, and raising the not-so-obvious questions they don't want people to ask: -How are recent changes to the Senate's filibuster rules a thinly- veiled extension of big government's limits on our civil rights? -Why have so many of our top military commanders been summarily pushed aside, after years of brave service? -When will the nefarious strategy of ""purposeful incompetence"" underlying Obamacare be exposed for what it is? -How is Obama's feckless foreign policy not just weakening us in the world, but actually endangering our security at home as well? STOP THE COMING CIVIL WAR is a no-holds-barred tale as gripping as any movie script in which some super hero or secret agent saves the day. Except no one but We the People can save the country we love. A page-turner from start to finish, this [intelligent and principled] fervent warning offers the Savage truth -- a call to action in the voting booth - in order to defend the freedoms our Constitution so brilliantly established. Read it and be ready to play your part in helping STOP THE COMING CIVIL WAR!""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Don't tell me to wait,Kerry Eleveld,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL17868743W?edition=ia%3Adonttellmetowait0000elev,/authors/OL7413512A/Kerry_Eleveld,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26450831M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 349,"""As a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama distanced himself from same-sex marriage, saying he believed marriage was ""a sacred union"" between a man and a woman. In 2012, he did just the opposite, proclaiming it was ""important"" for him to affirm the right of same-sex couples to marry. This dramatic about-face put the most powerful man in the world at the front of the battle for gay rights, giving LGBT Americans and their advocates an invaluable ally in their struggle for freedom. Just one year later, the Supreme Court would strike down key provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act, and no Democratic presidential nominee would ever again shun marriage equality. As former Advocate journalist Kerry Eleveld shows, Obama's support transformed the issue of gay rights from a political liability into an electoral imperative, and in Don't Tell Me to Wait she offers a boots-on-the-ground account of how gay rights activists pushed the president to this political tipping point. Obama's ""evolution"" on marriage equality was not the result of a benevolent politician who entered the Oval Office with a wealth of good intentions. Rather, pressure from lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender activists changed the conversation, issue by issue. As a result of the protests and outcry following the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban, Obama realized that overturning the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy was the one 2008 campaign promise he couldn't ignore. While pledges to other progressive constituencies fell apart during Obama's first two years in office, the LGBT rights movement protested the administration's fecklessness early and often. By the time the sun set on the 111th Congress, the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" repeal had become the sole piece of major progressive legislation to become law. The repeal's overwhelming success and popularity paved the way for other LGBT advances, including the president's eventual embrace of the freedom to marry. With unprecedented access and unparalleled insights into this hot-button issue, Don't Tell Me to Wait captures a critical moment in LGBT history and demonstrates the power of activism to change the course of a presidency--and a nation.""--  ""As former Advocate journalist Kerry Eleveld shows, Obama's support transformed the issue of gay rights from a political liability into an electoral imperative, and in Don't Tell Me to Wait she offers a boots-on-the-ground account of how gay rights activists pushed the president to this political tipping point.

In a lively and engaging narrative, the author uses gender as the lens through which to examine the processes of democratization, marketization and newly emergent nationalism. She shows the centrality of gender to these processes and the ways in which rigid codes of masculinity and femininity limit people's choices. Individual chapters examine mainstream politics versus the promotion of civil society as routes to empowerment and participation. Barbara Einhorn highlights the growing public-private divide in the region, pinpointing the negative influences of the neo-liberal market model and its gendered media representations. Voices of scholars and actors from the region enliven the narrative. With great clarity, the author reveals the relevance of fully active citizenship within a vibrant civil society as a measure of democracy and gender equitable societies.

American foreign policy since World War II has long been seen primarily as a story of strong and successful alliances, domestic consensus, and continuity from one administration to the next. Why then have so many presidents--even those most admired today--left office condemned for their foreign policy record? In his fresh and compelling history of America's rise to dominance, Stephen Sestanovich makes clear that U.S. diplomacy has always stirred controversy, both at home and abroad. He shows how successive administrations have struggled to find new solutions, alternating between bold ""maximalist"" strategies and retrenchment efforts to downsize America's role. Almost all our presidents--and all their most important decisions, from defeat in Vietnam through victory in the Cold War to today's new challenges--emerge from this vivid retelling in a sharp and unexpected light.

This new understanding of pain brought with it a complex set of moral and philosophical dilemmas. If pain serves no obvious purpose, how do we reconcile its existence with a well-ordered universe? Examining how writers of the day engaged with such questions, Victorian Pain offers a compelling new literary and philosophical history of modern pain. Rachel Ablow provides close readings of novelists Charlotte Brontë and Thomas Hardy and political and natural philosophers John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, and Charles Darwin, as well as a variety of medical, scientific, and popular writers of the Victorian age. She explores how discussions of pain served as investigations into the status of persons and the nature and parameters of social life. No longer conceivable as divine trial or punishment, pain in the nineteenth century came to seem instead like a historical accident suggesting little or nothing about the individual who suffers. A landmark study of Victorian literature and the history of pain, Victorian Pain shows how these writers came to see pain as a social as well as a personal problem. Rather than simply self-evident to the sufferer and unknowable to anyone else, pain was also understood to be produced between persons--and even, perhaps, by the fictions they read.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

El corpus jurídico que constituyen sus obras fue el inspirador y promotor de un sistema justo de colonización de las tierras descubiertas en el Nuevo Mundo. Las tres «relecciones» jurídicas —Sobre el poder civil, Sobre los indios y Sobre el derecho de la guerra— se enmarcan en un vasto plan que se propuso desarrollar en las conferencias públicas o «relecciones» que daba en la Universidad y le acreditan como fundador de la Escuela de Salamanca. La base del proyecto está en Sobre el poder civil, que contiene los principios jurídicos de la sociedad civil. Esta primera «relección» lleva el germen de las otras dos, posteriores en el tiempo. En Sobre los indios y Sobre el derecho de la guerra Vitoria completa la exposición de su pensamiento jurídico en torno a la sociedad con una visión moderna y universalista del derecho de gentes y propugna la «república de todo el orbe» que debe regirse por el Derecho Internacional.

This situation fosters the very separations, exclusions, and hierarchies it claims to deplore as Muslims face discrimination in education, housing, and employment. In Constructing Muslims in France, Jennifer Fredette provides a deft empirical analysis to show the political diversity and complicated identity politics of this relatively new population. She examines the public identity of French Muslims and evaluates images in popular media to show how stereotyped notions of racial and religious differences pervade French public discourse. While rights may be a sine qua non for fighting legal and political inequality, Fredette shows that additional tools such as media access are needed to combat social inequality, particularly when it comes in the form of unfavorable discursive frames and public disrespect.

Now many are on a mission to prove he shouldn't be president. The Trump administration and the press are at war -- and as in any war, the first casualty has been truth.

These movements emerge out of distinct contexts and yield different outcomes, but tend to share one thing in common: online and offline solidarity shaped around the public display of emotion. Social media facilitate feelings of engagement, in ways that frequently make people feel re-energized about politics. In doing so, media do not make or break revolutions but they do lend emerging, storytelling publics their own means for feeling their way into events, frequently by making those involved a part of the developing story. Technologies network us but it is our stories that connect us to each other, making us feel close to some and distancing us from others. Affective Publics explores how storytelling practices facilitate engagement among movements tuning into a current issue or event by employing three case studies: Arab Spring movements, various iterations of Occupy, and everyday casual political expressions as traced through the archives of trending topics on Twitter. It traces how affective publics materialize and disband around connective conduits of sentiment every day and find their voice through the soft structures of feeling sustained by societies. Using original quantitative and qualitative data, Affective Publics demonstrates, in this groundbreaking analysis, that it is through these soft structures that affective publics connect, disrupt, and feel their way into everyday politics""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this groundbreaking book, Clifford Bob analyzes the clashes, proposing a new model of global policy making - and unmaking. This highlights the battle of networks, marked by exclusionary strategies, negative tactics, and dissuasive ideas. Bob first investigates the fight over gay rights, in which a coalition of religious conservatives, the ""Baptist-burqa"" network, confronts human rights groups at the United Nations and in such countries as Sweden, Romania, and Uganda. Next, he examines conflicts over gun control, pitting firearms enthusiasts against disarmament and safety advocates in the UN, Brazil, and elsewhere. Bob's provocative findings extend beyond the culture wars. With its critical conclusions about norms, activists, and institutions, this book will change how campaigners fight, analysts study international issues, and all of us think about global politics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each chapter combines substantive knowledge with the kind of skill-building and analytical inquiry that is being touted at top universities across the country. Contributors to New Directions highlight why the questions they seek to answer are critical for understanding American politics, and situate them in the broader context of controversies in research. The book will introduce students to how political science works, in addition to how our political system works. The teaching of American politics follows a well-worn path. Textbooks for introductory courses hew to a traditional set of chapters that describe the Founding, American institutions, the ways citizens participate in politics, and sometimes public policy. The material rarely engages students in the kind of questions that animate scholarship on politics. One hurdle for instructors is finding material that reflects quality scholarship--and thus teaches students about why, not just what--and yet is accessible for undergraduates. Articles in scholarly journals are typically unsuited for undergraduate courses, particularly introductory courses. What is needed is a book that conveys exciting trends in scholarship across vital topics in American politics and illustrates analytical thinking. New Directions in American Politics is that book and will be an ideal companion to standard textbooks that focus mostly on nuts and bolts of politics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And while experts have already formed a provisional understanding of the Obama administration's foreign policy goals, the shape of the ""Obama Doctrine"" is finally coming into full view. It has been consistently cautious since Obama was inaugurated in 2009, but recent events in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Far East have led an increasingly large number of foreign policy experts to conclude that caution has transformed into weakness. In The Obama Doctrine, Colin Dueck analyzes and explains what the Obama Doctrine in foreign policy actually is, and maps out the competing visions on offer from the Republican Party. Dueck, a leading scholar of US foreign policy, contends it is now becoming clear that Obama's policy of international retrenchment is in large part a function of his emphasis on achieving domestic policy goals. There have been some successes in the approach, but there have also been costs. For instance, much of the world no longer trusts the US to exert its will in international politics, and America's adversaries overseas have asserted themselves with increasing frequency. The Republican Party will target these perceived weaknesses in the 2016 presidential campaign and develop competing counter-doctrines in the process. Dueck explains that within the Republican Party, there are two basic impulses vying with each other: neo-isolationism and forceful internationalism. Dueck subdivides each impulse into the specific agenda of the various factions within the party: Tea Party nationalism, neoconservatism, conservative internationalism, and neo-isolationism. He favors a realistic but forceful US internationalism, and sees the willingness to disengage from the world by some elements of the party as dangerous. After dissecting the various strands, he articulates an agenda of forward-leaning American realism--that is, a policy in which the US engages with the world and is willing to use threats of force for realist ends. The Obama Doctrine not only provides a sharp appraisal of foreign policy in the Obama era; it lays out an alternative approach to marshaling American power that will help shape the foreign policy debate in the run-up to the 2016 elections""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The internet is a vital arena of communication, self expression, and interpersonal organizing. When there is a message to convey, words to get out, people to organize, many will turn to the internet as a theater for that activity. As familiar and widely accepted activist tools--petitions, fundraisers, mass letter-writing, call-in campaigns and others--find equivalent practices in the online space, is there also room for the tactics of disruption and civil disobedience that are equally familiar from the realm of street marches, occupations, and sit-ins? Grounding the analysis historically, focusing on early deployments of activist DDOS as well as modern instances to trace its development over time, this book uses activist DDOS actions as the foundation of a larger analysis of the practice of disruptive civil disobedience on the internet""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Using an array of data and analysis, Marisa Abrajano and Zoltan Hajnal show that fears about immigration fundamentally influence white Americans' core political identities, policy preferences, and electoral choices, and that these concerns are at the heart of a large-scale defection of whites from the Democratic to the Republican Party.Abrajano and Hajnal demonstrate that this political backlash has disquieting implications for the future of race relations in America. White Americans' concerns about Latinos and immigration have led to support for policies that are less generous and more punitive and that conflict with the preferences of much of the immigrant population. America's growing racial and ethnic diversity is leading to a greater racial divide in politics. As whites move to the right of the political spectrum, racial and ethnic minorities generally support the left. Racial divisions in partisanship and voting, as the authors indicate, now outweigh divisions by class, age, gender, and other demographic measures.White Backlash raises critical questions and concerns about how political beliefs and future elections will change the fate of America's immigrants and minorities, and their relationship with the rest of the nation""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By scrutinising the interaction of institutional design with state interests, Forum Shopping in International Disputes analyses why particular forums are selected in maritime boundary disputes. The act of forum shopping, it argues, is more than the identification of the forum most likely to award a favourable decision. Rather, other interests come into play, such as concerns about domestic standing and the wish to draw international attention to a case. In other words, the best forum in a given dispute is the one that conforms most closely to a government's overarching policy. This book is especially notable for its use of qualitative case studies, a much-needed contribution to the growing body of research on forum selection, and for its detailed actor-centred approach, which comparatively assesses the merits of available forums. Focusing on the UN system, it provides an account of why states sometimes call on the Security Council and at other times prefer the International Court of Justice.

For Colored Girls Who Have Consider Politics is a sweeping view of American history from the vantage points of four women who have lived and worked behind the scenes in politics for over thirty years--Donna Brazile, Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, and Minyon Moore--a group of women who call themselves The Colored Girls. Like many people who have spent their careers in public service, they view their lives in four-year waves where presidential campaigns and elections have been common threads. For most of the Colored Girls, their story starts with Jesse Jackson's first campaign for president. From there, they went on to work on the presidential campaigns of Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Over the years, they've filled many roles: in the corporate world, on campaigns, in unions, in churches, in their own businesses and in the White House. Through all of this, they've worked with those who have shaped our country's history--US Presidents such as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, well-known political figures such as Terry McAuliffe and Howard Dean, and legendary activists and historical figures such as Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, and Betty Shabazz. For Colored Girls Who Consider Politics is filled with personal stories that bring to life heroic figures we all know and introduce us to some of those who've worked behind the scenes but are still hidden. Whatever their perch, the Colored Girls are always focused on the larger goal of ""hurrying history"" so that every American -- regardless of race, gender or religious background -- can have a seat at the table. This is their story""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Examining the record of the House minority party from 1970 to the present, and drawing from a wide range of quantitative and qualitative data, Green shows how and why the minority seeks to influence legislative and political outcomes and demonstrates that the party's efforts can succeed. The result is a fascinating appreciation of what the House minority can do and why it does it, providing readers with new insights into the workings of this famously contentious legislative chamber""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE AND STUDENT SUCCESS ON THE BSN EXIT EXAMS IN THE PENNSYLVANIA SSHE SCHOOLS OF NURSING (BACCALAUREATE),Jacqueline Stefanik,political_science,First published in 1994,/works/OL12280174W,/authors/OL5369337A/Jacqueline_Stefanik,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 161,"The purpose of this study was to describe the programs in terms of faculty's and chairs' perceptions of organizational climate and to determine the potential relationships between organizational climate and student success, i.e., educational outcomes on the BSN Exit Exams. This was done for baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the 10 Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (SSHE) schools in 1992.  The Organizational Climate Index (OCI-375SF) was used to measure climate. Student success by programs was measured by the Mean Percent Correct z-equivalent (MPC-z) on the BSN Exit Exams. These included the NLN BSN Exam, Mosby AssessTest, NLN DRT, and a Dept. Comp.  The population included 101 full-time nursing faculty and 10 chairs. The sample consisted of the 10 schools of nursing, with 10 chairs and 64 faculty responding.  Eight research questions were analyzed to determine whether a relationship existed between the eight OCI variables and student success on the BSN Exit Exams. One research question examined the existence of relationships among the eight OCI variables. Another six research questions involved the existence of relationships between the Institutional Profile variables (the percent of admissions, rejections, and graduates, faculty years of experience, and percent of classroom and clinical time) and student success on the BSN Exit Exams. All research questions were analyzed using Pearson Correlations.  None of the OCI variables were found to be a good predictor of student success. However, the highest r-values were.859 and.801, respectively, for the Intellectual Climate, and Orderliness variables. these produces p-values less than.05. Thus, these two OCI variables were noted as possible candidates for further study. It was found that most all of the six first order OCI scores were significantly related to each other. Finally, it was concluded that none of the Institutional Profile variables were good predictors of student success on the BSN Exit Exams. The correlations involving the percent of admissions and class time did produce r-values of.727 and.606, respectively. However, these did not produce p-values less than.05.

In Corporation Nation Derber addresses the unchecked power of today's corporations to shape the way we work, earn, buy, sell, and think—the very way we live. Huge, far-reaching mergers are now commonplace, downsizing is rampant, and our lines of communication, news and entertainment media, jobs, and savings are increasingly controlled by a handful of global—and unaccountable—conglomerates. We are, in effect, losing our financial and emotional security, depending more than ever on the whim of these corporations. But it doesn't have to be this way, as this book makes clear. Just as the original Populist movement of the nineteenth century helped dethrone the robber barons, Derber contends that a new, positive populism can help the U.S. workforce regain its self-control.  Drawing on core sociological concepts and demonstrating the power of the sociological imagination, he calls for revisions in our corporate system, changes designed to keep corporations healthy while also making them answerable to the people. From rewriting corporate charters to altering consumer habits, Derber offers new aims for businesses and empowering strategies by which we all can make   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

As a result, millions have died, economies are in shambles, and whole states are on the brink of collapse. Political observers and policymakers are starting to believe that economic aid is not the key to saving Africa. So what does the continent need to do to throw off the shackles of militant rule? African policy expert George Ayittey argues that before Africa can prosper, she must be free. Taking a hard look at the fight against dictatorships around the world, from Ukraine's orange revolution in 2004 to Iran's Green Revolution last year, he examines what strategies worked in the struggle to establish democracy through revolution. Ayittey also offers strategies for the West to help Africa in her quest for freedom, including smarter sanctions and establishing fellowships for African students.

How will they regard the United States, democracy, free speech, and immigration? What do they think of their current leaders? And what sorts of tactics will they bring to international negotiating tables, political and otherwise? Splinters in the Ice provides an engaging, intimate, and unprecedented window onto the mindsets of the next generation of leaders in Russian politics, business, and economics. In it, Ellen Mickiewicz, one of the world's foremost experts on Russian media, politics and culture, draws on interviews with students in Russia's three most elite universities, the training grounds for all of the nation's leadership. Allowing these students to speak in their own words, she shares their thoughts on international relations, the domestic and international media, democratic movements, and their government. She also shows how their total immersion in the world of the internet - an immersion that sets them apart from the current generation of Russian leadership and much of the rest of the country - frames the way that they think and affects their trust in their leaders, the media, and their colleagues. Mickiewicz also looks at the nation's recent protests and nascent political movements to show how they came about and to consider what promise, if any, they might hold for a more democratic Russia.

This book examines the impact of the 1998 Agreement which halted the violence on those most affected by it--the Northern Irish people themselves. Using public opinion surveys conducted over half a century, this book covers changes in public opinion across all areas of society and politics, including elections, education, community relations and national identity. The surveys show that despite peace, Protestants and Catholics remain as deeply divided as ever. The vast majority marry co-religionists, attend religious schools and have few friends across the religious divide. The results have implications not just for peace-making in Northern Ireland, but for other societies emerging from conflict. The main lesson of peace-making in Northern Ireland is that political reform has to be accompanied by social change across the society as a whole. Peace after conflict needs social as well as political change""--Publisher's website.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"International relations, meaning and mimesis",Necati Polat,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16215793W,/authors/OL7027927A/Necati_Polat,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25078689M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 198,"International Relations, Meaning and Mimesis is an innovative assessment of the uses of theory in making sense of international politics, opening up new pathways to thinking about the basics of the study area.  Insights drawn from an interdisciplinary corpus of critical scholarship are synthesized and brought to bear on key concepts such as sovereignty, the state, peace, law, justice, ethics, and supranationality. The mainstream characteristically dismisses the narrativity that accompanies these concepts as derivative, tending to treat meaning attributable to them as static. The work shows how problematic this disdain of mimesis (exchange, reproduction, imitation) is and how this mindset effectively incapacitates conventional theorizing in both predicting phenomena and providing a normative vision. Integrating the study of international politics into debates in the wider academia over meaning and mimesis, this ambitious work is fluent and accessible at the same time, with exceptional lucidity in presenting difficult philosophical notions.  A series of radical positions advanced in the book on theory and methodology not only address and call to account the mainstream imagination on international politics but also outline the implications of this critique for a host of specific issue areas, including peace research, normative theories, international law, and European studies.

Was können und müssen die Einzelnen tun, um individuelles und staatliches Wohlergehen zu ermöglichen? Wie weit können staatliche Regelungen gehen und wie können Menschen zur Regelbefolgung motiviert werden? Dies sind Fragen, denen die Platonischen Staatskonzeptionen Politeia und Nomoi nachgehen und die auch aktuelle Diskussionen bestimmen. Die Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede in Platonischen und aktuellen Perspektiven sind Gegenstand in dem von Sabine Föllinger und Evelyn Korn herausgegebenen Tagungsband. Er vereint in einem innovativen Zugang Beiträge aus der Klassischen Philologie, Ökonomie, Philosophie und Alten Geschichte. Sie machen deutlich, dass auch das Platonische Menschenbild das Modell eines ""homo oeconomicus"" kennt und dass Platons rigide Normierungen des wirtschaftlichen Lebens eine Reaktion auf die athenische Realität seiner Zeit sind. Ebenso wird herausgearbeitet, dass Platons Auffassung davon, auf welche Weise Werte und Ziele entstehen, sich von modernen Zugängen unterscheidet. In der Verbindung dieser Perspektiven zeigt sich gleichzeitig die methodische Vielfalt der beteiligten Disziplinen und führt vor, wie fruchtbar der fächerübergreifende Dialog ist.

Dass Kanzler Könige und Bürger Bauern abgelöst haben, hat daran nichts geändert. Andererseits hält diese Mesalliance erstaunlich viel aus - selbst nach blutigen Konflikten arrangiert man sich wieder und findet ein neues Gleichgewicht der Frustration.

Over three days, Rosen recorded ten hours of conversations with the man known as the ""Darth Vader"" of American politics. A small fraction of the interview was adapted into an April 2015 Playboy interview; but now, Rosen shares the whole, incredible conversation. With no topic off limits, the former vice president opened up about his complicated relationships with President George W. Bush and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and talks candidly about why his influence in the White House waned over Bush's second term. Rosen also presses Cheney about his WWII-era childhood, his two DUI arrests and expulsion from Yale, his political coming-of-age during the Watergate era, his reflections on 9/11 and the Iraq War, his misgivings about Syria and North Korea, his role in the development of the CIA's ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and the NSA's warrantless surveillance program, and his views on life, death, and God.

Yet in 1977 she became the first female Assistant to the President for Public Liaison under Jimmy Carter, emerging as a prominent focal point of the American culture wars. Tasked with bringing the views of special interest groups to the president, Costanza championed progressive causes even as Americans grew increasingly divided on the very issues for which she fought. In A Feminist in the White House, Doreen Mattingly draws on Costanza's personal papers to shed light on the life of this fascinating and controversial woman. Mattingly chronicles Costanza's dramatic rise and fall as a public figure, from her initial popularity to her ultimate clashes with Carter and his aides. While Costanza challenged Carter to support abortion rights, gay and lesbian rights, and feminist policies, Carter faced increased pressure to appease the interests of emerging Religious Right, which directly opposed Costanza's ideals. Ultimately, marginalized both within the White House and by her fellow feminists, Costanza was pressured to resign in 1978. Through the lens of Constanza's story, readers catch a unique perspective of the rise of debates which have defined the feminist movement and sexual politics to this very day. Mattingly also reveals a wider, but heretofore neglected, narrative of the complex era of gender politics in the late 1970's Washington--a history which continues to resonate in politics today. A Feminist in the White House is a must-read for anyone with an interest in sexual politics, female politicians, and presidential history""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For many, the responsibility for the impasse that scuppered the Haass talks and brought violent protests to the streets of Belfast appears to rest with the perceived intransigence of the Protestant, Unionist and Loyalist communities to embrace change. That this community is itself riven with internal rancour and discord should come as no surprise. Issues of social class, denominational alignment, political aspiration and national identity have historically divided what outsiders have often mistakenly viewed as a collective cultural, religious and socio-political entity.This study explores the statement by Henry McDonald that this is '...the least fashionable community in Western Europe'.

In this new book, Fritz Schwarz, who was chief counsel to the U.S. Church Committee on Intelligence- which uncovered CIA plots to assassinate world leaders, including Fidel Castro's exploding cigar- uses examples ranging from the dropping of the first Atomic bomb, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, to Iran Contra and 9/11 to illuminate this central question: How much secrecy does good governance require? Schwarz argues that while some control of information is necessary, governments tend to fall prey to a culture of secrecy that is ultimately not just hazardous to democracy but antithetical to it."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Perhaps not, but it is the title to the preface of this tongue-in-cheek and unexpectedly revealing exploration of human behavior by the webmaster behind the popular PoopReport.com. This book is not a history of poop, but a study of today. Its goal is to understand how poop affects us, how we view it, and why; to appreciate its impact from the moment it slides out of our anal sphincters to the moment it enters the sewage treatment plant; to explore how we've arrived at this strange discomfort and confusion about a natural product of our bodies; to see how this contradiction-the natural as unnatural-shapes our minds, relationships, environment, culture, economics, media, and art.  Paul Provenza, the director of The Aristocrats, says in his foreword: ""It's shocking to think that a book about poop can be considered an act of courage. But it is. Most of us have knee-jerk responses to the topic that we are not even aware of. Attitudes that, like the awful stench of poop itself, permeate all of society and culture.

In a world of limitless technology, we are more connected than ever before but our hyper-connected lifestyles threaten our ability to know ourselves and interact with each other. By focusing on the four core values that allow us to become truly ""connected"" in tech-centric societies--empathy, patience, focus, and humility--Otto demonstrates that the power of technology is not in the tool, but in the intention of the person using it. Everyday Ambassador offers a unique solution to those who aspire to truly make a difference in the twenty-first century--revealing the secrets of how to unite people, even when technology keeps us at a distance from others--emotionally and physically. Otto helps us lift our heads up from our cell phones and tablets and take a look at the people standing right in front of us. In a time when good citizenship is the new currency of cool, Everyday Ambassador gives us the tactics to connect in our disconnected world""--  ""In a world of limitless technology, we are more connected than ever before, but our hyper-connected lifestyles threaten our ability to know ourselves and meaningfully interact with each other. Everyday Ambassador offers a solution to this disconnectivity paradox--reflections, everyday examples, and tools that anyone can use every day and everywhere to maximize technology's capacity for social change. With an emphasis on the core values of focus, empathy, humility, and patience, Everyday Ambassador demonstrates that the power of technology is not in the tool but in the intention of the person using it. Everyday ambassadorship is a process that starts from the inside out and serves our countries, cities, communities, and even our own homes.

In this study, the author examines a pivotal period in Britain's rise to power status that culminated in the defeat of France in the struggle for North America in the Seven Years' War. The central themes in this book are the choices between war and peace, America of Europe. Due weight is given to the period of the War of the Austrian Succession 1740-48, when British policy was far from successful and when the major theme was concern with European developments, and to the years of inter-war diplomacy, when the agenda was once again dominated by European developments, specifically the attempt to create a continental system of collective security to off set the Franco-Prussian alliance. Focusing on the diplomacy of the period rather than, as with the majority of works, emphasizing the dominance of a struggle with France for colonial and maritime superiority, new light is thrown on British foreign policy in this period.

Political theory for mortals,John Evan Seery,political_science,First published in 1996,/works/OL3262263W?edition=ia%3Apoliticaltheoryf00seer,/authors/OL531695A/John_Evan_Seery,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL977342M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Cornell University Press|Language English|Pages 230,"Despite an abundance of violence occurring in political contexts, no liberal political theorist since Thomas Hobbes has talked directly and coherently about death. John E. Seery does. He contends that liberalism desperately needs a theoretical framework in which to discuss pressing matters of human mortality. Among the contemporary political issues that cry out for theoretical articulation, Seery suggests, are abortion politics, ethnic cleansing, suicide assistance, national reparations, environmental degradation, and capital punishment. Seery offers a new conception of social contract theory as a framework for confronting death issues. He urges us to look to an older tradition of descent into an underworld, wherein classic theorists consulted poetically with the dead and acquired from them political insight and direction.In this lively book, Seery excavates the infernal tradition by rereading the politics of death in Platonism, early Christianity, and contemporary feminism. Building on those traditions, he proposes a new, constructive image of death that can serve democratic theory productively. Reconsidered from the ""land of the shades,"" social contractarian theory is sufficiently altered that, for example, a pro-life Christian and a pro-choice secularist might be able to strike common ground upon which to discuss abortion politics.

Es präsentiert, kommentiert und diskutiert die wichtigsten politikwissenschaftlichen Ansätze, die den Übergang autokratischer in demokratische Herrschaftsordnungen zu erklären suchen. Auf dem Hintergrund dieser theoretischen Überlegungen werden die besonderen Hindernisse, Probleme und Chancen herausgearbeitet, die sich innerhalb der drei großen Transformationsetappen - der Ablösung des alten Regimes, der Institutionalisierung sowie der Konsolidierung der Demokratie - ergeben. Abschließend wird anhand von drei Beispielen Osteuropas gezeigt, warum Transformationsprozesse hin zur Demokratie erfolgreich verlaufen (Ungarn), verzögert werden (Rußland) oder scheitern (Weißrußland). Das Buch eignet sich besonders für Studenten und Interessierte, die sich einen Überblick über die Ansätze, Probleme und Ergebnisse der Transformations- und Demokratisierungsforschung verschaffen wollen.

Maladies of modernity,David N.

More specifically, it focuses on the problem of scientism. Scientism is a deformation of science, which unnecessarily restricts the scope of scientific inquiry by placing a dogmatic faith in the method of the natural sciences. Its adherents call for nothing less than a complete transformation of society. Science becomes the idol that can magically cure the perpetual maladies of modern society and of human nature itself. Whitney demonstrates that scientism is intellectually impoverishing and politically dangerous. Whitney surveys the development of scientism from early modernity to the present day, beginning with Francis Bacon, arguing that Bacon stands as the founder, not only of the experimental method, but also of scientism. This is most evident in his presentation of a scientific utopia in New Atlantis. After briefly noting the impact of Isaac Newton and the French Encylopedists, Whitney then moves on to the other great representative figure of scientism: Auguste Comte, who demonstrates the religious fervor that accompanies the scientistic attitude. Continuing on the path set forth by Bacon, Comte argues for a reorganization of society based on the precepts of positive science. The solution to scientism, Whitney advances, lies in a new (or revised) science of politics; the foundation of which is based on the Classical sources that were either discredited or banned outright by the proposals of Bacon and Comte. He concludes the work with contemporary examples of scientism, including the climate change debates, genetic engineering, and the New Atheism movement""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How is it to be won and preserved in our time? He notes that our government's increasingly unlimited powers flow in part from our statesmen's inability to stay out of wars or to win them and that our statesmen and academics have ceased to think about such things. The purpose of this book is to rekindle such thoughts. The author reestablishes early American statecraft's understanding of peace-what it takes to make it and what it takes to keep it. He reminds Americans why our founding generation placed the pursuit of peace ahead of all.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Our bodies, whose property?",Anne Phillips,political_science,First published in 2013,/works/OL19704568W?edition=ia%3Aourbodieswhosepr0000phil,/authors/OL445015A/Anne_Phillips,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26917747M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Princeton University Press|Language English|Pages 202,"""No one wants to be treated like an object, regarded as an item of property, or put up for sale. Yet many people frame personal autonomy in terms of self-ownership, representing themselves as property owners with the right to do as they wish with their bodies. Others do not use the language of property, but are similarly insistent on the rights of free individuals to decide for themselves whether to engage in commercial transactions for sex, reproduction, or organ sales. Drawing on analyses of rape, surrogacy, and markets in human organs, Our Bodies, Whose Property? challenges notions of freedom based on ownership of our bodies and argues against the normalization of markets in bodily services and parts. Anne Phillips explores the risks associated with metaphors of property and the reasons why the commodification of the body remains problematic. What, she asks, is wrong with thinking of oneself as the owner of one's body? What is wrong with making our bodies available for rent or sale? What, if anything, is the difference between markets in sex, reproduction, or human body parts, and the other markets we commonly applaud? Phillips contends that body markets occupy the outer edges of a continuum that is, in some way, a feature of all labor markets. But she also emphasizes that we all have bodies, and considers the implications of this otherwise banal fact for equality. Bodies remind us of shared vulnerability, alerting us to the common experience of living as embodied beings in the same world. Examining the complex issue of body exceptionalism, Our Bodies, Whose Property? demonstrates that treating the body as property makes human equality harder to comprehend""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book gives a concise, non- technical account of these 'public choice' theories and examines their influence upon government policies in English-speaking countries. Issues covered include slimming the state, privatising welfare and re- structuring government. Final chapters offer an alternative view of the basis of good government. This book offers a unique survey and critique of the ideas and influence of an important branch of political thought and it links with market theories.

Who holds the purse strings to the majority of the world's wealth? There is a new global elite at the controls of our economic future, and here former Project Censored director and media monitoring sociologist Peter Phillips unveils for the general reader just who these players are. The book includes such power players as Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon, and Warren Buffett.         As the number of men with as much wealth as half the world fell from sixty-two to just eight between January 2016 and January 2017, according to Oxfam International, fewer than 200 super-connected asset managers at only 17 asset management firms—each with well over a trillion dollars in assets under management—now represent the financial core of the world's transnational capitalist class. Members of the global power elite are the management—the facilitators—of world capitalism, the firewall protecting the capital investment, growth, and debt collection that keeps the status quo from changing. Each chapter in Giants identifies by name the members of this international club of multi-millionaires, their 17 global financial companies—and including NGOs such as the Group of Thirty and the Trilateral Commission—and their transnational military protectors, so the reader, for the first time anywhere, can identify who constitutes this network of influence, where the wealth is concentrated, how it suppresses social movements, and how it can be redistributed for maximum systemic change.

También muestra el origen del carácter tradicional y provinciano de una élite conservadora, de tipo tradicionalista en donde el peso de las relaciones de parentesco constituyen uno de los elementos determinantes en la conformación del poder político en Tabasco.    El libro también muestra de manera puntual las debilidades del gobierno en turno y la quiebra financiera que agobia a un estado en el que hay pocos visos de cambio democrático- Finalmente plantea que la ciudadanización de la política es tal vez la única alternativa que tiene México de avanzar en la construcción de una sociedad democrática.

After rejecting the standard justifications most commonly used in support of the killing, Strawser ultimately argues that the killing was ethically permissible as an act of defensive harm on behalf of innocents. The book contends bin Laden was morally responsible for a collection of unjust threats such that he was liable to be killed. Moreover, the many unique features of the bin Laden case -such as the use of pre-emptive harm and the collective agency of al-Qaeda - do not defeat that liability. The monograph also includes discussions of the apparent violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and the morally dubious celebrations of bin Laden's death, among other morally relevant issues.

Under authoritarian rule, relentless injustice creates the objective conditions for expressions of popular protest which may culminate in popular uprisings, as witnessed in many Arab countries at the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Unsurprisingly, the slogans of the Arab Liberation Tide (ALT) popular revolts centered around freedom, implying sound democratic governance, social justice, and human dignity for all. In reality, the short-lived governance arrangements which followed the January 2011 popular revolt in Egypt, for example, were little more than extensions of the authoritarian governance system the revolt set out to overthrow. There were differences, of course, between the three short-lived regimes that took power since then, but in form, rather than substance. This book uses a structuralist political economy framework rather than a detailed historical account as it considers how the ALT may prove to be an historic opportunity for human renaissance in the Arab World - or alternatively a disaster of epic proportions. ""--  ""The monograph aims to present a compassionate analysis of the Arab popular uprisings in the 21st century, with particular reference to two important cases, Egypt and Tunisia, in an analytic framework anchored in a structuralist political economy framework rather than a detailed historical account of the popular uprisings""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet an enhanced understanding is needed if we are to gain, not only a more effective purchase on social processes involved in well-being, or on links between poverty and place, but also of the stratagems people adopt to challenge or cope with social and economic difficulties and resist their deleterious effects. Drawing on key concepts and on community studies conducted in East London housing estates, this book brings together diverse strands of influence on participatory community life and individual well-being. Residents' rich narratives are used to emphasize the significance of different social network patterns for mediating disadvantage and happiness. The book makes a timely contribution to post 2010 policy agendas and to current political debates on the 'big society' and the 'good society'""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Despite the prominence of such efforts, the nature and impact of social sanction in international politics remains highly contested.This unique collection unpacks the concept and practice of naming and shaming. Drawing on a diverse range of issues and theoretical controversies in the International Relations and Human Rights literatures, the contributors to this collection explore the ways in which state and non-state actors wield public exposure as an instrument of leverage and combine it with material sanction, the contextual factors that shape these combinations, and the conditions that generate effective pressure.This volume will be of interest to students, scholars, policymakers, and practitioners interested in international relations, human rights, the diffusion of global norms, transnational crime, targeted sanctions, corporate social responsibility, and the dynamics of leverage in international politics.

Standing just a few feet from President Obama, the neurosurgeon offered a common sense critique of liberal government, calling for a return to our historic culture of personal responsibility, free markets, and upward mobility. Now, in this sequel to their #1 New York Times bestseller America the Beautiful, Dr. and Mrs. Carson offer a bold plan to stop the country's slide into fiscal and moral decay. Avoiding the political correctness of politicians and the animosity of Washington lawyers, Dr. Carson calls for respectful discussion and disagreement, with no subjects off limits. Applying the problem-solving skills he honed as a surgeon, he takes on tough issues such as education, health care, family values, race relations, taxes, charity, and the role of faith in public life. In his journey from poverty to the top of his field, Dr. Carson has lived the American dream. He shows how we can save that dream for our future generations, by restoring a moral, informed citizenry that will support ""one nation, under God, indivisible.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet she was also a prominent figure in politics during the French Revolution. Biancamaria Fontana sheds new light on this often overlooked aspect of Staël's life and work, bringing vividly to life her unique experience as a political actor in a world where women had no place. The banker's daughter who became one of Europe's best-connected intellectuals, Staël was an exceptionally talented woman who achieved a degree of public influence to which not even her wealth and privilege would normally have entitled her. During the Revolution, when the lives of so many around her were destroyed, she succeeded in carving out a unique path for herself and making her views heard, first by the powerful men around her, later by the European public at large. Fontana provides the first in-depth look at her substantial output of writings on the theory and practice of the exercise of power, setting in sharp relief the dimension of Staël's life that she cared most about--politics. She was fascinated by the nature of public opinion, and believed that viable political regimes were founded on public trust and popular consensus. Fontana shows how Staël's ideas were shaped by the remarkable times in which she lived, and argues that it is only through a consideration of her political insights that we can fully understand Staël's legacy and its enduring relevance for us today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But youthful dissent did not appear overnight; for decades it has been simmering beneath the surface in countries from Saudi Arabia to Yemen, from Iran to Egypt. In Arab Spring Dreams, a number of young Middle Easterners describe their experiences with the region's laws and cultural mores, including the crime of holding hands before marriage, discrimination and harassment over religious beliefs, and young women fighting for the right to complete their educations. They also discuss how previous uprisings, particularly the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, might be channeled to effect change in their own countries.

Many believe that the White House is Hillary Clinton's to lose. As long-time strategists Morris and McGann reveal in this book, however, Hillary's plans are vulnerable to a challenge from the Bush administration's secretary of state and former national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice. Rice is the only figure on the national scene who has the credentials, the credibility, and the charisma to lead the GOP in 2008. And, as this first book on the subject demonstrates, a race between these two commanding, but very different, women is a very real possibility--and would prove one of the most fascinating and important races in American history.

The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken.  But it’s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.  This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant’s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In Unfair, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning.  Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.  Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases—from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case—Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society’s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system’s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.

In this explosive new book, the legendary Jim Marrs, author of the underground bestseller Rule by Secrecy, reveals the frighteningly real possibility that today the United States is becoming the Fourth Reich, the continuation of an ideology thought to have been vanquished more than a half century ago.This concept may seem absurd to those who cannot see past the rose-colored spin, hype, and disinformation poured out daily by the media conglomerates—most of which are owned by the very same families and corporations who supported the Nazis before World War II. But as Marrs precisely explains, National Socialism never died, but rather its hideous philosophy is alive and active in modern America. Unfortunately, most people cannot understand the shadowy links between fascism and corporate power, the military, and our elected leaders.While the United States helped defeat the Germans in World War II, we failed to defeat the Nazis. At the end of the war, ranking Nazis, along with their young and fanatical proteges, used the loot of Europe to create corporate front companies in many countries, including the United States of America. Utilizing their stolen wealth, men with Nazi backgrounds and mentalities wormed their way into corporate America, slowly buying up and consolidating companies into giant multinational conglomerates. Many thousands of other Nazis came to the United States under classified programs such as Project Paperclip. They brought with them miraculous weapon technology that helped win the space race but they also brought their insidious Nazi philosophy within our borders. This ideology based on the authoritarian premise that the end justifies the means—including unprovoked wars of aggression and curtailment of individual liberties—has gained an iron hold in the ""land of the free and the home of the brave.""For the first time Jim Marrs has gathered compelling evidence that an effort has been underway for the past sixty years to bring a form of National Socialism to modern America, creating in essence a modern empire—or ""Fourth Reich""!

Instead of positing particular definitions of being Muslim, this volume invites and encourages a diverse body of 735 informants from Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK to reflect on who they are and on the meaning and place Islam has in such considerations. Drawing upon extensive fieldwork and suggesting novel ways of seeing the phenomenon of European Islam and the continent's Muslim communities, Islam in Europe examines how through their practices, discourses, face to face and mediated interaction, European Muslims construct notions or identity, agency, solidarity and belonging, or how they negotiate and redefine religion, tradition, authority and cultural authenticity. Theoretically and methodologically innovative, Islam in Europe makes a significant contribution to better understanding European Islam and Europe's Muslims.

Its influence in military issues is well known, but its role in shaping cultural and political activities has not received enough attention. Kanaaneh sheds new light on the organization's successful evolution as a counterhegemonic force in the region's resistance movement, known as ""Muqawama."" Founded on the idea that Islam is a resisting religion, whose real heroes are the poor populations who have finally decided to take action, Hezbollah has shifted its focus to advocate for social justice issues and to attract ordinary activists to its cause. From the mid-1990s on, Hezbollah has built alliances that allow it to pursue soft power in Lebanon, fighting against both the dominant Shi'ite elites and the Maronite-Sunni, as well as Israeli and US influence in the region. Kanaaneh argues that this perpetual resistance--military as well as cultural and political--is fundamental to Hezbollah's continued success.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Chinese people had been ravaged by long years of domestic struggle, terrible famine and economic and political isolation. Today, China has the world's second largest economy and is a major player in global diplomacy. This volume, written by some of the leading experts in the field, tracks China's extraordinary transformation from the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, through the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and  the death of Chairman Mao, to its dynamic rise as a superpower in the twenty-first century. The latest edition of the book includes a new introduction and a seventh chapter which focuses on the legacy of Deng Xiaoping, the godfather of China's transformation, under his successors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Under Mao, China challenged the outside world ideologically and militarily. Today China's challenge as an economic and diplomatic superpower may prove even more formidable. As a comprehensive and authoritative appraisal of China's last sixty years, this book will be invaluable for professionals working in the region and for students assessing what China will mean for their futures""--  ""Thirty years ago, China was a basket case, ravaged by long years of domestic political struggle and the worst famine in human history.

Near abroad,Gerard Toal,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL20045439W,/authors/OL2735382A/Gerard_Toal,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28727288M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 387,"""Vladimir Putin's intervention into the Georgia/South Ossetia conflict in summer 2008 was quickly recognized by Western critics as an attempt by Russia to increase its presence and power in the ""near abroad"", or the independent states of the former Soviet Union that Russia still regards as its wards. Though the global economic recession that began in 2008 moved the incident to the back of the world's mind, Russia surged to the forefront again six years later when they invaded the heavily Russian Crimea in Ukraine and annexed it. In contrast to the earlier Georgia episode, this new conflict has generated a crisis of global proportions, forcing European countries to rethink their relationship with Russia and their reliance on it for energy supplies, as Russia was now squeezing natural gas from what is technically Ukraine. In Near Abroad, the eminent political geographer Gerard Toal analyzes Russia's recent offensive actions in the near abroad, focusing in particular on the ways in which both the West and Russia have relied on Cold War-era rhetorical and emotional tropes that distort as much as they clarify. In response to Russian aggression, US critics quickly turned to tried-and-true concepts like ""spheres of influence"" to condemn the Kremlin. Russia in turn has brought back its long tradition of criticizing western liberalism and degeneracy to grandly rationalize its behavior in what are essentially local border skirmishes. It is this tendency to resort to the frames of earlier eras that has led the conflicts to ""jump scales,"" moving from the regional to the global level in short order. The ambiguities and contradictions that result when nations marshal traditional geopolitical arguments-rooted in geography, territory, and old understandings of distance-further contributes to the escalation of these conflicts. Indeed, Russia's belligerence toward Georgia stemmed from concern about its possible entry into NATO, an organization of states thousands of miles away. American hawks also strained credulity by portraying Georgia as a nearby ally in need of assistance. Similarly, the threat of NATO to the Ukraine looms large in the Kremlin's thinking, and many Ukrainians themselves self-identify with the West despite their location in Eastern Europe. ""--  ""In sum, by showing how and why local regional disputes quickly develop into global crises through the paired power of historical memory and time-space compression, Near Abroad reshapes our understanding of the current conflict raging in the center of the Eurasian landmass and international politics as a whole""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book is a collection of essays from the conference The Brazilian State: Paths and Prospects of Dirigisme and Liberalization held at The Graduate Center, City University of New York in November 2009.

The authors of the essays knew that the principles of our Founding would not always be unquestioned, so they gave us the strongest defense of those principles as part of the immediate political struggle for ratification. The Federalist not only illuminates the meaning of the Constitution's text. It also explains how our Constitution embodies the core principles of the Declaration of Independence and why it must be preserved in the face of present struggles. In this monograph, Anthony Peacock, professor of political science at Utah State University, offers us a brief guide to The Federalist, a road map illuminating the major issues treated in the essays and explaining their continued relevance for us today. An appendix of important passages on contemporary subjects is also included as a helpful resource for interested readers. Despite our contemporary challenges, we still enjoy some measure of constitutional government. More important, our Founders have left us with their teaching and example, showing us the way to restore our Constitution to its rightful place. Our Constitution will endure only if our leaders understand why it is defensible, and there is no better argument in favor of the Constitution than The Federalist Papers.

Il s'agit précisément de mener à son terme, dans un système unifié du savoir, la détermination de l'étant en procédant à son extension à la question de l'être de l'homme et de l'être-en-commun propre à la société politique. Au commencement du XVII° siècle, une autre direction pour l'accomplissement du projet ontologique non identifiable à celle d'une science mathématique de la nature se profile et préfigure une récurrence persistante des origines de la philosophie. Ainsi, on trouve dans le système suarézien la retranscription originale et réactualisée d'une ligne de force traversant la pensée antique: l'ontopolitique.

The essays discuss how to reconcile multiple ontologies without subsuming them to a totalitarian unity. While one school of thought (Deleuze, Negri) seeks to create a new ontology based on the many instead of the one, (which, politically, is close to anarchy), another proposes to understand the ""one"" as the ""ultra-one"" of the event (Badiou). In this groundbreaking work, leading thinkers explore these debates and offer alternative concepts. Building on Jean-Luc Nancy's essay who proposes an ontology of ""singular plurality,"" contributors aim to synthesize the one and the many and suggest different ways of forming collectives, beyond the dominant representative political forms. An original and challenging work, Politics of the One addresses new possible ways of bringing people together, integrating philosophy with theoretical and practical problems of politics"" --  ""Leading thinkers address the relationship between the one and the many in this Political Theory and Contemporary Philosophy volume""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The 11 case studies, based across India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, explore how state regulative law is often ignored and/or selectively manipulated. The emerging collective narrative shows the workings of regulated criminal economic systems where criminal formations, politicians, police, judges and bureaucrats are deeply intertwined.  By pioneering the field-study of the politicisation of economic crime, and disrupting the wider literature on South Asia?s informal economy, The Wild East aims to influence future research agendas through its case for the study of mafia-enterprises and their engagement with governance in South Asia and outside.

Yet despite the enduring appeal of works from the Parthenon to Michelangelo's David to Picasso's Guernica, histories of both art and democracy have ignored this phenomenon. Millions have admired the works of art covered in this book but relatively few know why they were commissioned, what was happening in the culture that produced them, and what they were meant to achieve. Even scholars who have worked on these objects for decades often miss the big picture as these objects have been traditionally studied in isolation. The goal of this book is to integrate the pursuits of creative excellence and human freedom on the grounds that this synthetic approach will bring a fresh, new perspective into both lines of inquiry. David's Sling places into context ten canonical works of art executed to commemorate the successes of free societies that exerted political and economic influence far beyond what might have been expected of them. The book thus fuses political and art history with a judiciously-applied dose of creative reconstruction to craft a lively narrative around each key work of art and the free system that inspired it. David's Sling tells their story""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

George Monbiot is one of the most vocal, and eloquent, critics of the current consensus. In How Did We Get into this Mess?, which collects Monbiot's journalism over the last seven years, he brilliantly anatomises the state we are in: the devastation of our environment, the crisis of inequality, the corporate takeover of Nature, our obsessions with growth and profit and the decline of the political debate over what to do. While his diagnosis of the problems in front of us is clear-sighted and reasonable, he also develops solutions to challenge this politics of fear""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Northern Europe has long been among the most progressive regions with respect to renewables--boasting Denmark and Germany, front-runners in wind and solar energy solutions--but also home to petroleum-based economies like Norway. By comparing and contrasting the experiences of such a diverse range of countries, this book identifies both barriers and success factors and explains why some countries have been so much more successful than others when it comes to renewable energy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hume's politics,Andrew Sabl,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16715221W,/authors/OL7155998A/Andrew_Sabl,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Princeton University Press|Language English,"""Hume's Politics provides a comprehensive examination of David Hume's political theory, and is the first book to focus on Hume's monumental History of England as the key to his distinctly political ideas. Andrew Sabl argues that conventions of authority are the main building blocks of Humean politics, and explores how the History addresses political change and disequilibrium through a dynamic treatment of coordination problems. Dynamic coordination, as employed in Hume's work, explains how conventions of political authority arise, change, adapt to new social and economic conditions, improve or decay, and die. Sabl shows how Humean constitutional conservatism need not hinder--and may in fact facilitate--change and improvement in economic, social, and cultural life. He also identifies how Humean liberalism can offer a systematic alternative to neo-Kantian approaches to politics and liberal theory. At once scholarly and accessibly written, Hume's Politics builds bridges between political theory and political science. It treats issues of concern to both fields, including the prehistory of political coordination, the obstacles that must be overcome in order for citizens to see themselves as sharing common political interests, the close and counterintuitive relationship between governmental authority and civic allegiance, the strategic ethics of political crisis and constitutional change, and the ways in which the biases and injustices endemic to executive power can be corrected by legislative contestation and debate""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Transparency"" has become the new mantra of politicians and pundits alike. But what does it mean in practice? In this informative, clearly written book community activist Donald Gordon defines the essential features of a transparent government and makes a convincing case that it is critical for a healthy and maturing democracy and the basic liberties we all take for granted. Gordon first presents a clear definition of transparency in government and why we should pursue it, followed by a review of the history of transparency in American politics. He then makes the case for how transparency serves as the foundation for active civic engagement. The heart of the book is Gordon's ""Transparency Index."" The author examines best practices in measuring transparency and then isolates the critical factors that can be used to assess any type of government and its commitment to transparency. In addition, a scoring system is presented that allows for comparison of government entities. For anyone who wishes that government were more effective and responsive, this book shows how these goals can be achieved""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Like those infamous ideologies, Islamism today touts imperialist dreams of world domination, belief in its inherent superiority, contempt for the rest of humanity, and often a murderous agenda. The author, born and raised in Egypt and now living in Germany, not only explains the historical connections between early 20th-century fascist movements in Europe and extremist factions in Islam, but he also traces the fascist tendencies in mainstream Islam that have existed throughout its history. Examining key individuals and episodes from centuries past, the book shows the influence of Islam's earliest exploits on current politics in the Islamic world. The author's incisive analysis exposes the fascist underpinnings of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Shia regime in Iran, ISIS, Salafi and Jihadist ideologies, and more. Forcefully argued and well-researched, this book grew out of a lecture on Islamic fascism that the author gave in Cairo, resulting in a call for his death by three prominent Egyptian clerics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This is the first book to offer a genuine cross-regional perspective on populism and its impact on democracy. By analyzing current experiences of populism in Europe and the Americas, this edited volume convincingly demonstrates that populism can be both a threat and a corrective to democracy. The contributors also demonstrate the interesting similarities between right-wing and left-wing populism: both types of populism are prone to defend a political model that is not against democracy per se, but rather at odds with liberal democracy. Populism in Europe and the Americas offers new insights into the current state of democracy from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The age of Clinton,Gil Troy,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL20012851W?edition=ia%3Aageofclintonamer0000troy,/authors/OL39297A/Gil_Troy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27192929M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Thomas Dunne Books|Language English|Pages 368,"""The 1990s was a decade of extreme change. Seismic shifts in culture, politics, and technology radically altered the way Americans did business, expressed themselves, and thought about their role in the world. At the center of it all was Bill Clinton, the talented, charismatic, and flawed Baby Boomer president and his controversial, polarizing, but increasingly popular wife Hillary. Although it was in many ways a Democratic Gilded Age, the final decade of the twentieth century was also a time of great anxiety. The Cold War was over, America was safe, stable, free, and prosperous, and yet Americans felt more unmoored, anxious, and isolated than ever. Having lost the script telling us our place in the world, we were forced to seek new anchors. This was the era of glitz and grunge, when we simultaneously relished living in the Republic of Everything even as we feared it might degenerate into the Republic of Nothing. Bill Clinton dominated this era, a man of passion and of contradictions both revered and reviled, whose complex legacy has yet to be clearly defined.In this unique analysis, historian Gil Troy examines Clinton's presidency alongside the cultural changes that dominated the decade. By taking the '90s year-by-year, Troy shows how the culture of the day shaped the Clintons even as the Clintons shaped it. In so doing, he offers answers to two of the enduring questions about Clinton's legacy: how did such a talented politician leave Americans thinking he accomplished so little when he actually accomplished so much? And, to what extent was Clinton responsible for the catastrophes of the decade that followed his departure from office, specifically 9/11 and the collapse of the housing market? Even more relevant as we head toward the 2016 election, The Age of Clinton will appeal to readers on both sides of the aisle""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The role of regional organizations in disaster risk management,Simon Hollis,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL23214010W,/authors/OL8799702A/Simon_Hollis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""The abrupt power of disasters pays no respect to political boundaries or the social fabric in today's complex and globalized world. The interruption of flights from volcanic ash clouds, damaged oil refineries from hurricanes and collapsed buildings from earthquakes can cause major damage nationally, produce ripple effects on the global economy and disrupt countless lives. The use of regional organizations to mitigate and respond to disasters in transboundary spaces has become a global trend. Yet, we know very little about how and whether these organizations can provide an additional layer of security for the state. Through a comparative study of ten regional organizations, Hollis explores both rational and cultural based explanations for explaining the role regional organizations play as managers of risk; a role fashioned by national-based interests as well as global norms. A valuable contribution to the under-explored yet growing issue of global protection, this book will appeal to scholars of international relations and humanitarian and development studies.

More than 25 state legislatures have already introduced copycat anti-immigration bills of Arizona's controversial SB 1070. But immigration reform is just the opening salvo-in Arizona, and for the 2012 elections.With one of the most radical Tea Party factions in control of its legislature, Arizona and its growing bevy of wingnut politicians have not only dislodged Sarah Palin as one of the most popular jokes on late night TV shows, but have set in motion one of the most alarming challenges to federal authority in history. The legislature has passed several bills challenging federal authority on gun laws, Medicaid, and the rights of undocumented children to attend school or go to the emergency room. One bill debated in the state congress proposed prohibiting ""courts from considering international law or legal percepts of other nations or cultures when making judicial decisions.""  Another bill required federal environmental inspectors to register with the sheriff whenever its representatives enter one of Arizona's fifteen counties. One Forbes reporter wrote that the bill could be summed up in three words: ""Stay outta Arizona."" As a precursor to the 2012 election, Arizona defiantly unveiled its vision of a Tea Party America--that may be our future""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Majority rule versus consensus,James H. Read,political_science,First published in 2009,/works/OL11955344W,/authors/OL5142866A/James_H._Read,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21559752M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  University Press of Kansas|Language English|Pages 288,"John C. Calhoun may be best known for his stature in the U.S. Senate and his controversial defense of slavery, but he is also a key figure in American political thought. The staunchest advocate of the consensus model of government as an alternative to majority rule, he proposed government not by one, by few, or by many, but by all: each key group enjoying veto rights over collective decisions.  Some consider consensus preferable to majority rule in deeply divided societies, and consensus theory has been advocated in such contemporary works as Lani Guinier's The Tyranny of the Majority. James Read's book, the first historically informed, theoretically sophisticated critique of Calhoun's political thought, goes beyond other studies to ask key questions about the feasibility of consensus. Read critically examines Calhoun's arguments, considering both their antebellum context--including Calhoun's spirited defense of slavery--and modern-day attempts to apply consensus models in Northern Ireland, the former Yugoslavia, and South Africa.  Read sheds new light on the crisis leading up to the Civil War by exploring Calhoun's conviction that his uncompromising defense of slavery would help preserve the Union. He also juxtaposes Calhoun's thought with that of Jefferson and Madison, whose legacies Calhoun invoked to support his claim that states had the right to nullify federal law, and he contrasts Madison's ultimate faith in majority rule with Calhoun's ultimate rejection of it.  Read argues that, although Calhoun's critique of majority rule deserves careful attention, his remedy is unworkable and in the end unjust. Read demonstrates that governments ruled by consensus tend to be ineffective, that they are better at preventing common action than achieving common goods, and that they privilege strategically placed minorities rather than producing genuine consensus.  Majority Rule versus Consensus is a provocative work that sheds new light on the promise and limitations of democracy, showing that, despite the failure of Calhoun's remedy, his diagnosis of the potential injustice of majority rule must be taken seriously. It discourages uncritical celebrations of democracy in favor of reflection on how committed democrats can better address the problems that Calhoun attempted to solve.

Written by American and Dutch scholars, the book will be of great interest to students of comparative politics, public policy analysts, mathematic modelers, and all those concerned with the development of the European Community. One set of models explored in this volume - the expected utility model - treats politics as a conflictual activity, while the other, the exchange or log rolling model, emphasizes the cooperative nature of political processes. The alternative approaches model decision making in fundamentally different ways and make very different predictions about how issues in the European Community will be resolved. To facilitate direct comparison of their predictive and explanatory value, the models in this volume are based on the same variables: the potential control of actors over outcomes, the salience of the issues for the actors, and the outcomes preferred by the actors. The contributors test their models in the context of sixteen issues already resolved by the Council of Ministers and six issues currently under consideration, providing the reader with considerable knowledge about the controversies surrounding European Community policy on such topics as automobile emissions, nuclear radiation norms, air transport liberalization, and the European banking system. They conclude that the conflictual model and the cooperative model are less competitive and more complementary than has been thought, and they explain in detail how the models can be fruitfully combined.

In Fixing Families, Jennifer Reich takes us inside Child Protective Services for an in-depth look at the entire organization. Following families from the beginning of a case to its discharge, Reich shows how parents negotiate with the state for custody of their children, and how being held accountable to the state affects a family. During her investigation Reich had access to many levels of CPS action, and within each chapter are heartbreaking stories culled from her many ride-alongs with social workers, and the numerous juvenile court cases that she was able to observe--stories that illustrate the dramatic personal effects of bureaucratic decisions.

Dancing Jacobins,Rafael Sánchez,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20037643W,/authors/OL7610261A/Rafael_Sánchez,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 393,"""Dancing Jacobins traces the populist 'monumental governmentality' that began to take shape in Venezuela and other Latin American nations around the time of independence, in response to the insistent return of subaltern populations in the form of crowds. Informed by a Bolivarian political theology, the nation's representatives, or 'dancing Jacobins,' draw on the repertoire of busts, portraits, and equestrian statues of national heroes scattered across Venezuela in a montage of monuments and dancing--or universal and particular. To this day, the nervous oscillation between crowds and peoplehood intrinsic to this form of government has inflected the republic's institutions and constructs, which are haunted and imbued from within by the crowds they otherwise set out to mold, enframe, and address""--  ""Since independence from Spain, a trope has remained pervasive in Latin America's republican imaginary: that of an endless antagonism pitting civilization against barbarism as irreconcilable poles within which a nation's life unfolds. This book apprehends that trope not just as the phantasmatic projection of postcolonial elites fearful of the popular sectors but also as a symptom of a stubborn historical predicament: the cyclical insistence with which the subaltern populations menacingly return to the nation's public spaces in the form of crowds""--  ""This long-awaited book presents an insightful and at the same time rollicking account of the Latin American populist form the author terms 'monumental governmentality.' It combines a theatricalizing of political leaders to a sometimes absurdly gigantic and statesque extent with those leaders' antic efforts to effectuate their political power through a syncopated, winking, salsa-like personal style that appeals directly to the mass audience. Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is the prime example, and the central focus of the book. Theoretically, the book is a marvelously rich example of anthropological writing, which can be read with pleasure by those not Latin Americanists for its insights in practical and poltiical philosophy. Historically and in term of policy, it gives an excellent account of a Latin American political style that tends simply to be laughed at in the U.S.--but that persists and is effective nonethess""--From publisher's website.

It ranges over an unusually broad range of topics in the field, including the just distribution of wealth, both within countries and globally; the nature and justification of political authority; the meaning and significance of freedom; arguments for and against democratic rule; the problem of war; and the grounds for toleration in public life. It also offers an accessible, non-technical discussion of perfectionism, utilitarianism, theories of the social contract, and of recently popular forms of critical theory. Throughout, the book challenges readers to think critically about political arguments and institutions that they might otherwise take for granted. It will be a provocative text for any student of philosophy or political science.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Schall tries to demonstrate that Roman Catholicism and political philosophy―-revelation and reason―are not contradictory. It is his contention that political philosophy, the primary focus of the book, asks certain questions about human purpose and destiny that it cannot, by itself, answer. Revelation is the natural complement to these important questions about God, human being, and the world. Schall manages to avoid polemicism or triumphalism as he shows that revelation and political thought contribute to a fuller understanding of each other.

Reagan,Bob Spitz,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL19754806W,/authors/OL581376A/Bob_Spitz,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27361496M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 863,"""More than five years in the making, based on hundreds of interviews and access to previously unavailable documents, and infused with irresistible storytelling charm, Bob Spitz's REAGAN stands fair to be the first truly post-partisan biography of our 40th President, and thus a balm for our own bitterly divided times. It is the quintessential American triumph, brought to life with cinematic vividness: a young man is born into poverty and raised in a series of flyspeck towns in the Midwest by a pious mother and a reckless, alcoholic, largely absent father. Severely near-sighted, the boy lives in his own world, a world of the popular books of the day, and finds his first brush with popularity, even fame, as a young lifeguard. Thanks to his first great love, he imagines a way out, and makes the extraordinary leap to go to college, a modest school by national standards, but an audacious presumption in the context of his family's station. From there, the path is only very dimly lit, but it leads him, thanks to his great charm and greater luck, to a solid career as a radio sportscaster, and then, astonishingly, fatefully, to Hollywood. And the rest, as they say, is history. Bob Spitz's REAGAN is an absorbing, richly detailed, even revelatory chronicle of the full arc of Ronald Reagan's epic life - giving full weight to the Hollywood years, his transition to politics and rocky but ultimately successful run as California governor, and ultimately, of course, his iconic presidency, filled with storm and stress but climaxing with his peace talks with the Soviet Union that would serve as his greatest legacy. It is filled with fresh assessments and shrewd judgments, and doesn't flinch from a full reckoning with the man's strengths and limitations""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It documents an extensive correspondence between the ideals cited in honorific inscriptions for the emperor erected across the Western Empire and those advertised on imperial coins minted at Rome. This reveals that the dissemination of specific imperial ideals was more pervasive than previously thought, and indicates a high degree of ideological unification amongst the aristocracies of the Western provinces. The widespread circulation of a particular set of imperial ideals, and the particular form of ideological unification that this brought about, not only reinforced the power of the Roman imperial state, but also increased the authority of local aristocrats, thereby facilitating a general convergence of social power that defined the High Roman Empire""--  ""The Roman empire, like all empires, may be seen as a particular configuration of power. Controlled by an interlinked set of central institutions and layered aristocracies, this configuration of power reached its widest extent, deepest penetration, and greatest stability between the late first century BC and early third century AD. One feature of this 250-year period that distinguishes it from the previous two and a half centuries, when the Roman state was creating its overseas empire, was the existence of a single, empire-wide ruler, the emperor, who functioned in part as a unifying symbol for the far-flung territories and widely scattered inhabitants of the Roman world.

Political consulting emerged as a profession in the 1930s with writers Leone Baxter and Clem Whitaker, the husband and wife team who built their business, in part, with a successful campaign to destroy Upton Sinclair's 1934 bid for governor of California. With roots in advertising and public relations, political consulting has since developed into a highly professionalized business worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

As such it tells not just the making of a political business but the very contours of modern American politics.""--  ""Though they work largely out of the public eye, political consultants-- ""image merchants"" and ""kingmakers"" to candidates-- play a crucial role in shaping campaigns. They persuaded Barry Goldwater to run for president, groomed former actor Ronald Reagan for the California governorship, helped derail Bill Clinton's health care initiative, and carried out the swiftboating of John Kerry. As Dennis Johnson argues in this history of political consulting in the United States, they are essential to modern campaigning, often making positive contributions to democratic discourse, and yet they have also polarized the electorate with their biting messages.

The Occupy movement made the plight of the 99 percent an indelible part of the public consciousness, and concerns about inequality were a decisive factor in the 2012 presidential elections. How bad is it? According to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, most Americans, in inflation-adjusted terms, are now back to the average income of 1966. Shockingly, from 2009 to 2011, the top 1 percent got 121 percent of the income gains while the bottom 99 percent saw their income fall. Yet in this most unequal of developed nations, every aspect of inequality remains hotly contested and poorly understood. Divided collects the writings of leading scholars, activists, and journalists to provide an illuminating, multifaceted look at inequality in America, exploring its devastating implications in areas as diverse as education, justice, health care, social mobility, and political representation. Provocative and eminently readable, here is an essential resource for anyone who cares about the future of America--and compelling evidence that inequality can be ignored only at the nation's peril.

This book explores the political thought of Bertrand de Jouvenel and Alfred Fabre-Luce, two French intellectuals, journalists and political writers who, from 1930 to the mid-1950s, moved between liberalism, fascism and Europeanism. Daniel Knegt argues that their longing for a united Europe was the driving force behind this ideological transformation-and that we can see in their thought the earliest stages of what would become neoliberalism.

The recognition rate lies at around one percent. What has happened to the refugees? Are there no longer any reasons to apply for asylum? In order to find asylum seekers, one must look in the new EU member states on the external borders, and to the countries immediately beyond the borders: because of regulations about jurisdiction, more and more refugees become stranded on the edges of the EU and can only reach other European target countries by irregular means. The study shows, using Germany and Poland as examples, how the significance of asylum law has changed over the last 20 years, how this change can be explained, and how it relates to migrants’ strategies.    Inthis manner the study offers new insight into the field of asylum policy in three respects: on the one hand, asylum policy is analysed in the context of category construction related to migration policy. In this way the significance of the categorization and hierarchization of ‘desirable and ‘undesirable’ migrants as a central component of ‘migration management’ is revealed. On the other hand, the two studies of individual countries provide an extensive picture of asylum policy in Germany and Poland. By embedding the two case studies in developments at EU level, and relating them to each other, the study offers a new and comprehensive insight into the dynamics which have determined the changes in the European asylum regime in the last two decades.

As a longtime partisan Democrat himself, he felt forced to acknowledge that his own views were too parochial, too absent of any exposure to the ""other side."" In fact, his urban neighborhood is so liberal, he couldn't find a single Republican--even by asking around. So for one year, he crossed the aisle to spend time listening, talking, and praying with Republicans of all stripes. With his mind open and his dial tuned to the right, he went to evangelical churches, shot a hog in Texas, stood in pit row at a NASCAR race, hung out at Tea Party meetings and sat in on Steve Bannon's radio show. He also read up on conservative wonkery and consulted with the smartest people the right has to offer. What happens when a liberal sets out to look at issues from a conservative perspective? Some of his dearly cherished assumptions about the right slipped away. Republican Like Me reveals what lead him to change his mind, and his view of an increasingly polarized America.

Eighteen experts introduce readers to a wide variety of systems spanning 4,000 years, from the earliest known states in world history to the Roman Empire and its immediate successors. They seek to understand the inner workings of these states by focusing on key issues: political and military power, the impact of ideologies, the rise and fall of individual polities, and the mechanisms of cooperation, coercion, and exploitation. This shared emphasis on critical institutions and dynamics invites comparative and cross-cultural perspectives. A detailed introductory review of contemporary approaches to the study of the state puts the rich historical case studies in context. Transcending conventional boundaries between ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean history and between ancient and early medieval history, this volume will be of interest not only to historians but also anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists, and political scientists. Its accessible style and up-to-date references will make it an invaluable resource for both students and scholars.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Gillon offers a revelatory new history of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders--popularly known as the Kerner Commission. Convened by President Lyndon Johnson after riots in Newark and Detroit left dozens dead and thousands injured, the commission issued a report in 1968 that attributed the unrest to ""white racism"" and called for aggressive new programs to end discrimination and poverty. ""Our nation is moving toward two societies,"" it warned, ""one black, and one white--separate and unequal."" Johnson refused to accept the Kerner Report, and as his political coalition unraveled, its proposals went nowhere.

""Our nation is moving toward two societies,"" they warned, ""one black, and one white--separate and unequal."" Fifty years later, Gillon draws on official records, never-before-seen private papers, and interviews with key players to offer an absorbing new account of the Kerner Commission's work and its vital legacies. Johnson, he shows, never intended the Commission as anything more than window dressing; when it took its mission seriously, he cut off its funding. And despite its unanimous report, the Commission was riven by generational, ideological, and racial divides that foreshadowed the fracturing of Johnson's liberal coalition and the reshaping of American politics in the years that followed. A vivid portrait of the possibilities and limitations of American liberalism at its apogee, Separate and Unequal is a crucial book for anyone seeking to understand our debate over race today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Community organiser Amanda Tattersall in Power in Coalition examines successful coalitions between unions and community organisations in three countries: the public education coalition in Sydney, Toronto’s Ontario Health Coalition fighting to save universal health care, and Chicago’s living wage campaign run by the Grassroots Collaborative.

"STRESS, BURNOUT AND BEING: A DASEIN ANALYSIS OF NURSES SEEKING AUTHENTICITY AND HEALTH IN HOSPITAL NURSE WORK","Everett, Karl Menoher Jr.",political_science,First published in 1991,/works/OL12272502W,/authors/OL5363096A/Everett_Karl_Menoher_Jr.,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 303,"Finding that burnout had no accepted standard definition; was not understood as to what it is; and, had no understood meaning for individuals and the researchers who use The Scientific Method, i.e., hypothetico-deductive epistemology, a paradigm shift to Heidegger's hermeneutic phenomenology was done. The shift was necessitated because of anomalies that were prevalent in the research literature. Two principal anomalies were: (1) Why do some persons become burned out while others do not? (2) Why do some become burned out and develop physical symptoms while others who burnout do not?.  A survey instrument containing the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Antonovsky' s Sense of Coherence short-form questionnaire (ASOC), 35 work related factors (WRF), 38 physical symptoms (PHYSYM), and four open-ended questions, was administered to 68 hospital nurses in two medical centers. The open-ended questions were used for the hermeneutic phenomenological analysis.  Analysis of empiric indicators (ontic reality), i.e., MBI, WRF, and PHYSYM, was done. Results revealed through descriptive statistics that some folks achieved high scores on the MBI, but may have high or low PHYSYM. This duplicated work done by other researchers using The Scientific Method.  Ontological analysis of two of the open-ended questions, i.e., one asked for response to an exceptionally good experience in respondent's job while the other asked for an exceptionally bad experience, was done. Phenomenological analysis revealed that respondents were dichotomized into two categories: those concerned with ""duties"", i.e., prescribed activities through doctor's orders, and those who gave added-values services, i.e., personal care and concern. The latter was labeled ""nursework"".  Further analysis revealed that those engaged in duties had an inclination to fear and low PHYSYM while those inclined to nursework were anxious and had high or low PHYSYM. Subsequently, those folks with high or low PHYSYM were found to inversely vary with ASOC.  Tentative conclusions are: burnout is either fear or anxiety and is useless as a meaningful term; ASOC is an ameliorating disposition; and, there are two types of nurses, those who do duties and become fearful and those who do nursework and become anxious.

Victims in the war on crime,Markus Dirk Dubber,political_science,First published in 2002,/works/OL6026219W?edition=ia%3Avictimsinwaroncr0000dubb,/authors/OL1513657A/Markus_Dirk_Dubber,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL15542183M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  New York University Press|Language English|Pages 399,"Publisher's description: Two phenomena have shaped American criminal law for the past thirty years: the war on crime and the victims' rights movement. As incapacitation has replaced rehabilitation as the dominant ideology of punishment, reflecting a shift from an identification with defendants to an identification with victims, the war on crime has victimized offenders and victims alike. What we need instead, Dubber argues, is a system which adequately recognizes both victims and defendants as persons. Victims in the War on Crime is the first book to provide a critical analysis of the role of victims in the criminal justice system as a whole. It also breaks new ground in focusing not only on the victims of crime, but also on those of the war on victimless crime. After first offering an original critique of the American penal system in the age of the crime war, Dubber undertakes an incisive comparative reading of American criminal law and the law of crime victim compensation, culminating in a wide-ranging revision that takes victims seriously, and offenders as well. Dubber here salvages the project of vindicating victims' rights for its own sake, rather than as a weapon in the war against criminals. Uncovering the legitimate core of the victims' rights movement from underneath existing layers of bellicose rhetoric, he demonstrates how victims' rights can help us build a system of American criminal justice after the frenzy of the war on crime has died down.

Sebastian Strangio, a journalist based in the capital city of Phnom Penh, now offers an eye-opening appraisal of modern-day Cambodia in the years following its emergence from bitter conflict and bloody upheaval. In the early 1990s, Cambodia became the focus of the UN's first great post-Cold War nation-building project, with billions in international aid rolling in to support the fledgling democracy. But since the UN-supervised elections in 1993, the country has slipped steadily backwards into neo-authoritarian rule under Prime Minister Hun Sen. Behind a mirage of democracy, ordinary people have few rights and corruption infuses virtually every facet of everyday life. In this lively and compelling book Strangio explores the present state of Cambodian society under Hun Sen's leadership, painting a vivid portrait of a nation struggling to reconcile the promise of peace and democracy with a violent and tumultuous past. -- from dust jacket.

In South East Asia, however, this axiom is valid only up to a point. Monarchy in South East Asia explores the roles played by the monarchy in the political life of a region in which both ruling and constitutional monarchies continue to maintain considerable authority.Roger Kershaw's fascinating study looks at the continued influence which the monarchy has had in South East Asia and considers its prospects given the influence of alternative ruling families such as the the Suhartos and the Lees. He surveys the monarchical tradition in the region and traces the ways in which it has evolved to the systems currently in place. Subjects covered include:* the impact and legacy of colonial rule the relationship between monarchy and democracy detailed case studies of Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand.This scholarly and comprehensive study is invaluable for students of Asian Studies and Comparative Politics. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the role of the monarchy in the modern world.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Objective and detailed, this account provocatively challenges the call for a return to a largely mythical golden age of economic regulation as a check on finance capital. In addition, it deftly illuminates how the era of neoliberal free markets has been, in practice, under-girded by state intervention on a massive scale. Arguing for genuinely transformative alternatives to capitalism, and discussing how to build the collective capacity to realize these goals, this record is a critique of the crisis and an indispensable springboard for a renewed political left.

Broadly defined as ?ways of getting things done?, these invisible yet powerful informal practices tend to escape articulation in official discourse. They include emotion-driven exchanges of gifts or favours and tributes for services, interest-driven know-how (from informal welfare to informal employment and entrepreneurship), identity-driven practices of solidarity, and power-driven forms of co-optation and control. The paradox, or not, of the invisibility of these informal practices is their ubiquity. Expertly practised by insiders but often hidden from outsiders, informal practices are, as this book shows, deeply rooted all over the world, yet underestimated in policy. Entries from the five continents presented in this volume are samples of the truly global and ever-growing collection, made possible by a remarkable collaboration of over 200 scholars across disciplines and area studies. By mapping the grey zones, blurred boundaries, types of ambivalence and contexts of complexity, this book creates the first Global Map of Informality.
