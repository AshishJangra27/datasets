The discussion treats Buddhist, Morisco, Morrano, Christian, and South American Indian relics considered from the perspectives of experts in Buddhism, art history, literary analysis, history, philosophy, Spanish Studies, and Celtic Studies. The anthology reveals the surprising commonalty of the significance of sacred objects across the globe while at the same time delineating their varied functions. Among the shared issues considered in the collection are the nature of access to the object (who is allowed to see the object, how, and when), the way relics delineate sacred space, community formation via sacred objects (who is included and who is excluded in the sacred community), and appropriation and reappropriation of sacred and devotional objects (who controls what object, where, and when.)""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Black lives and sacred humanity,Carol Wayne White,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL20974704W,/authors/OL393299A/Carol_Wayne_White,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Fordham University Press|Language English|Pages 164,"Identifying African American religion as the ingenuity of a people constantly striving to inhabit their humanity and eke out a meaningful existence for themselves amid harrowing circumstances, Black Lives and Sacred Humanity constructs a concept of sacred humanity and grounds it in the writings of Anna Julia Cooper, W.E.B. Du Bois, and James Baldwin. Supported by current theories in science studies, critical theory, and religious naturalism, this concept, as Carol Wayne White demonstrates, offers a capacious view of humans as interconnected, social, value-laden organisms with the capacity to transform themselves and create nobler worlds wherein all sentient creatures flourish. Acknowledging the great harm wrought by divisive and problematic racial constructions in the United States, this book offers an alternative to theistic models of African American religion to inspire newer, conceptually compelling views of spirituality that address a classic, perennial religious question: What does it mean to be fully human and fully alive? -- adapted from Amazon.

The first part introduces the history approaches to eschatology. The second part concerns the reasons for eschatological statements in light of important aspects of the doctrine of God and Christ. The third part is devoted to different concepts of the relationship between eternity and time, space and infinitude as well as the question of what is good, true and beautiful. Using a thematic structure, the multiple different approaches and concepts of modern eschatology are clearly presented, and illuminated by the perspective of the classical teachings on the Last Things; which are ultimately brought together in a synthesis. This is an important contribution to a crucial part of the study of systematic theology""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

And a thoughtful observer can be relatively certain that battles about church and state, and more specifically about religion in the schools, are going to be characteristic of the first decades of the new millennium as they have been for the last two centuries. - Introduction.

Abasciano's intertextual exegesis of Romans 9 started in his acclaimed volume, Paul's Use of the Old Testament in Romans 9.1-9. Abasciano's method incorporates into a thorough traditional exegesis a comprehensive analysis of Paul's use of scripture against the background of interpretive traditions surrounding the texts alluded to, with great emphasis placed on analyzing the original contexts of Paul's citations and allusions. This intertextual exegesis is conducted with an awareness of the broader unit of chapters 9-11 especially, as well as the epistle as a whole. Based on careful, detailed exegesis, Abasciano tackes controversial theological subjects with precision and depth, such as election and divine hardening of human beings, shedding light on Paul's theology as it unfolds in Rom. 9.10-18. - Back cover.

EQUIPPING THE CONGREGATION FOR A MINISTRY TO THE AGED,Roland Elzie Cavanaugh,religion,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280801W,/authors/OL5369911A/Roland_Elzie_Cavanaugh,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 43,"The number of Americans over the age of 65 is increasing dramatically. This increase, in conjunction with certain theological imperatives, requires that the Church develop new and effective ways to minister to this group. The First Wesleyan Church of Ramseur, North Carolina felt a need to respond to this group in new and healthy ways. The author and congregation developed a project that enabled the church to minister to a select group of aged persons.  Reaching the point where helpful ministry took place was a challenging and sometimes difficult endeavor. It was achieved through training sessions led by various government resource persons and speakers to help prepare the congregation for ministry. These resources included: Hospice, the Home Health Department, a nursing home chaplain, and other similar experts in the field of elder-care. The end result of visitation to several aged persons was enhanced by the knowledge that the congregation gained through the training sessions.  The congregation was able to minister both to the community and also the local aged of the congregation. This ministry was developed into a home mission to the aged in the congregation. The broader effect, however, was a ministry to anyone within the congregation in a crisis situation. This ministry was developed by those who originally carried on the work to the elderly of the community. This ministry goes beyond the elderly and positively impacts many lives.  While the intentions of the congregation of First Wesleyan Church were centered on the elderly, the results of that ministry are very different from what was originally planned. In the process of ministry, the church began to see the needs of the entire community and developed a burden for that community. This includes outreach, issues of justice and mercy, and genuine compassion. Although the thrust of the ministry project was an effort to help the elderly, the results are broader and much more comprehensive. Whereas the goals of the congregation were fairly narrow, the experience of developing and carrying out the ministry led to a deeper understanding of what it means to truly minister.

A profoundly interdisciplinary approach to comparative scholarship, Ecologies of Participation offers a methodology whereby we can face our shared planetary predicament. It is grounded in process philosophy, and asserts the importance of a new ontology of agency. It traces the importance of Lévy-Bruhl and Lévi-Strauss’s early work, while offering new insight into the ontological turn in anthropology. This book sets out to destabilize modern reductionist trends toward scientific materialism, without falling into postmodern cultural constructivism. It does not assume the givenness of nature or culture. By advancing a multi-ontology approach, this work offers robust interventions into decolonial and critical studies. Cabot takes contemporary scholarship in new and exciting directions—offering an unstable ground from which to examine our shared worlds, both human and other. Throughout the last chapters of the book, these threads are illuminated through a detailed ethics of comparison and participation."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Until about the 1970s, the dominant narrative in the history of science had long been that of science triumphant, and science at war with religion. But a new generation of historians both of science and of the church began to examine episodes in the history of science and religion through the values and knowledge of the actors themselves. Now Ronald Numbers has recruited the leading scholars in this new history of science to puncture the myths, from Galileo's incarceration to Darwin's deathbed conversion to Einstein's belief in a personal God who ""didn't play dice with the universe."" The picture of science and religion at each other's throats persists in mainstream media and scholarly journals, but each chapter in Galileo Goes to Jail shows how much we have to gain by seeing beyond the myths. - Publisher.

This book attempts to answer that question, beginning with a dialogue with the Vatican Declaration Dominus Iesus and discerning how Schillebeeckx's methodology has been applied in Asian theology. Employing the hermeneutical-critical method, Schillebeeckx asserts that the Word of God did not come ""down to us, as it were, vertically in a purely divine statement""--it must be interpreted! In today's context of so many religions, so many cultures, and so many poor, God's Word invites the church to be a ""sacrament of dialogue."" Through dialogue the church will be ""challenged by other religions and challenge them in return."" Christianity will then be ""put in its place, as well as given the place which is its due.""

Focusing on the Assemblies of God denomination, the story begins in 1918, when white missionaries fanned out from the South and Midwest to convert Native Americans in the West and other parts of the country. Drawing on new approaches to the global history of Pentecostalism, Angela Tarango shows how converted indigenous leaders eventually transformed a standard Pentecostal theology of missions in ways that reflected their own religious struggles and advanced their sovereignty within the denomination. Key to the story is the Pentecostal ""indigenous principle,"" which encourages missionaries to train local leadership in hopes of creating an indigenous church rooted in the culture of the missionized. In Tarango's analysis, the indigenous principle itself was appropriated by the first generation of Native American Pentecostals, who transformed it to critique aspects of the missionary project and to argue for greater religious autonomy. More broadly, Tarango scrutinizes simplistic views of religious imperialism and demonstrates how religious forms and practices are often mutually influenced in the American experience. - Publisher.

John Rist tests his argument via a number of avenues: man's creation in the image of God and historical difficulties about incorporating women into that vision; the relationship between God's mercy and justice; the possibility of Christian aesthetics; the early development of the see of Rome as the source of an indispensable doctrinal unity for Christian culture; the search for the proper role of the Church in politics. He also argues that such an understanding of Catholic culture is necessary if contemporary assumptions about inalienable rights and the value of the human person are to be defended. The alternatives are a value-free, individualist universe on the one hand, and a fundamentalist denial of human nature and of history on the other.

Dancing on Tisha B'av,Lev Raphael,religion,First published in 1990,/works/OL77231W?edition=ia%3Adancingontishaba00raph,/authors/OL39385A/Lev_Raphael,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1876741M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1990|Publisher  St. Martin's Press|Language English|Pages 231,"From Publishers Weekly:  Tisha B'Av (the Ninth of the Hebrew month of Ab), which commemorates the destruction of both Jerusalem temples, is observed by fasting and public mourning. In the title story of Raphael's first collection, a gay student has been publicly humiliated in a university synagogue. Furious and frustrated, he lashes out at God and his own commitment to Judaism by dancing on the holiday. Raphael's characters, struggling to find identities as Jews, gays or children of Holocaust survivors, are angry, humorless and largely self-absorbed. Although message dominates plot in most of the tales, when the author permits personalities and events to play themselves out, he creates a more natural and sympathetic setting for his themes. In ""War Stories,"" a remote, morose New York cab driver believes he is his family's sole survivor. When a cousin long thought dead enters his cab, he is transformed; he can finally break down and express his emotions. In ""Abominations, "" on the other hand, in which the characters in the title story are reencountered, Raphael errs into overemphasis: the torching of the gay student's dormitory room is compared by his sister to the Holocaust's conflagrations. Here as in other stories, Raphael forgets that people's lives can be interesting, instructive and important without the explicit ascription of cosmic significance.     Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.  From Library Journal:  The 19 short stories in this first collection give the reader a glimpse of what it's like to be gay and Jewish, probing the problems encountered when trying to reconcile seemingly incompatible sensibilities. The author draws interesting parallels between the treatment of Jews in Europe before and during the World War II; several stories include concentration camp survivors parenting gay children, with each generation painfully aware of the discrimination and suffering experienced by the other. The title story begins with a sister admiring her brother's devotion to Orthodoxy, while refusing to confront his homosexuality; it concludes with his expulsion from his religious minyan, the torching of his dorm room by bigots, and her new understanding and sensitivity to another potential holocaust.

To help reveal the complexity and intricacy of the webs of meaning in which they are suspended, Tom Inglis interviewed one-hundred people in their native home of Ireland  to discover what was most important and meaningful for them in their lives. Inglis believes language is a medium: there is never an exact correspondence between what is said and what is felt and understood. Using a variety of theoretical lenses developed within sociology and anthropology, Inglis places their lives within the context of Ireland's social and cultural transformations, and of longer-term processes of change such as increased globalisation, individualisation, and informalisation""--  ""Meaning makes social life possible.

She ached for God's comfort but felt utterly alone.  Then she discovered a secret that suffering souls through the centuries have learned: She began using psalms and classic hymns to speak the truth to her fretful soul. The truths carried by these timeless songs---many of which Brestin includes in this book---can calm the most fretful spirit. They invite the wounded heart to be quiet before God, to rest like a child in the arms of a loving parent.   Each of us must travel down roads of bereavement, betrayal, and broken dreams. The God of All Comfort will help readers find their way into the arms of God. With compassion and spiritual wisdom, Brestin draws on the difficult beauty of her own story as well as her skills as a Bible teacher to offer companionship, comfort, and hope.

Some have linked this to a neo-liberal form of individualism, while others noted that secularism has left people bereft of a humanly necessary link with the transcendent. The importance of identity issues has also been remarked upon. This book examines how liberal forms of religion are allowing people to engage with religion on their own terms, while also feeling part of something more universal. Looking at liberal approaches to the Abrahamic faiths - Judaism, Protestant and Roman Catholic Christianity and Islam - this book teases out how postmodern culture has shaped the way in which people engage with these religions. It also compares and contrasts how liberal thinking and theology have been expressed in each of the faiths examined, as well as the reactionary responses to its emergence. By considering how liberalism has influenced the narrative around the Abrahamic faiths, this book demonstrates how malleable faith and spirituality can be. As such, it will be of interest to scholars working in Religious Studies, Theology, Sociology and Cultural Anthropology.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Is it more awe-inspiring to suppose that a transcendent God fashioned the cell, or to consider that the living organism was created by the evolving biosphere? As the eminent complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman explains in this ambitious and groundbreaking new book, people who do not believe in God have largely lost their sense of the sacred and the deep human legitimacy of our inherited spirituality. For those who believe in a Creator God, no science will ever disprove that belief. In Reinventing the Sacred, Kauffman argues that the science of complexity provides a way to move beyond reductionist science to something new: a unified culture where we see God in the creativity of the universe, biosphere, and humanity. Kauffman explains that the ceaseless natural creativity of the world can be a profound source of meaning, wonder, and further grounding of our place in the universe. His theory carries with it a new ethic for an emerging civilization and a reinterpretation of the divine. He asserts that we are impelled by the imperative of life itself to live with faith and courage-and the fact that we do so is indeed sublime. Reinventing the Sacred will change the way we all think about the evolution of humanity, the universe, faith, and reason.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

North considers a range of themes relevant to the interpretation of the Fourth Gospel. First, the relationship between the Gospel and 1 John. North explores the value of the Epistle as a means of identifying traditional material the evangelist knew, on which basis North analyses John's composition of the Lazarus story in chapter 11. Second, John's Christology in which North looks to John's cultural roots in monotheistic Judaism to understand his capacity to align Jesus with God. Third, the crucial issue of 'the Jews' in John, where North clarifies the data by observing a narrative logic in John's use of the expression. Fourth, North identifies John's 'anticipated' eschatology as a consolation strategy aimed at a readership struggling under life-threatening circumstances in the absence of Jesus. Finally, North looks at John and the Synoptics, and demonstrates how evidence drawn from the Gospel itself can serve to indicate whether or not John composed directly on the basis of the Synoptic record. This collection draws together a number of ground-breaking studies from over thirty years of work on the Fourth Gospel, presenting a cohesive development of thought on this crucial Christian text""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The work is written in a Herodotean-style of Ionic Greek, and has been traditionally ascribed to the Hellenized Syrian essayist Lucian of Samosata.  De Dea Syria describes the worship as being of a phallic character, with votaries offering little male figures of wood and bronze. There were also huge phalli set up like obelisks before the temple, which were ceremoniously climbed once a year and decorated. The treatise begins with a re-telling of the Atrahasis flood myth where floodwaters are drained through a small cleft in the rock under the temple.[2]   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Provides ethnographic description and analysis of the symbolic and technical relations of the Achuar to the Amazon environment. This pioneering model of a synthetic ecological/symbolic approach investigates dynamic interactions between techniques used in socializing nature and the symbolic systems that sustain these interactions. Overcomes previous limitations of materialist ecological and conceptual symbolic analyses. The value of this contribution is its understanding of the Achuar process of domesticating nature and of the long-run implications of this process for resource use in the Amazon environment""--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 57.

When one religion isn't enough,Duane R.

But some people regularly cross religious boundaries. These ""spiritually fluid"" people celebrate complex religious bonds, and in the process they blur social categories, evoke prejudice, and complicate religious communities. Their presence sparks questions: How and why do people become spiritually fluid? Are they just confused or unable to commit? How do we make sense of them? When One Religion Isn't Enough explores the lives of spiritually fluid people, revealing that while some chose multiple religious belonging, many more inherit it. For many North Americans, the complicated legacies of colonialism are part of their family story, and they may consider themselves both Christian and Hindu, or Buddhist, or Yoruban, or one of the many other religions native to colonized lands. For some Asian Americans, singular religious identity may seem an alien concept, as many East Asian nations freely mix Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, and other traditions. Some African American Christians are consciously seeking to reconnect with ancestral spiritualities. And still other people are born into religiously mixed families. Jewish-Christian intermarriage led the way in the US, but religious diversity here is only increasing: almost four in ten Americans (39 percent) who have married since 2010 have a spouse who is in a different religious group. Through in-depth conversations with spiritually fluid people, renowned scholar Duane Bidwell explores how people come to claim and be claimed by multiple religious traditions, how spiritually fluid people engage radically opposed truth claims, and what this growing population tells us about change within our communities.  In the United States, we often assume religious and spiritual identity are pure, static, and singular. But some ""spiritually fluid"" people celebrate complex religious bonds, and in the process they blur social categories, evoke prejudice, and complicate religious communities. Bidwell explores the lives of spiritually fluid people, revealing that while some chose multiple religious belonging, many more inherit it through complicated legacies of colonialism or being born into religiously mixed families.

The transformation of ancient cults into faith systems, which we recognise now as major world religions, took place in the first millennium AD, in the period we call 'Late Antiquity'. Our argument is that the creative impetus for both the emergence, and much of the visual distinctiveness of the world religions came in contexts of cultural encounter. Bridging the traditional divide between classical, Asian, Islamic and Western history, this exhibition and its accompanying catalogue highlights religious and artistic creativity at points of contact and cultural borders between late antique civilisations. This catalogue features the creation of specific visual languages that belong to four major world religions: Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam. The imagery still used by these belief systems today is evidence for the development of distinct religious identities in Late Antiquity. Emblematic visual forms like the figure of Buddha and Christ, or Islamic aniconism, only evolved in dialogue with a variety of coexisting visualisations of the sacred.0As late antique believers appropriated some competing models and rejected others, they created compelling and long-lived representations of faith, but also revealed their indebtedness to a multitude of contemporaneous religious ideas and images. 00Exhibition: Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, UK (19.10.2017-18.02.2018).

Religious plurality and interreligious contacts in the Middle Ages,Dorothea Weltecke,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL32286190W,/authors/OL5760552A/Dorothea_Weltecke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Harrassowitz Verlag (in Kommission)|Language English|Pages 224,"This volume brings together Spanish and German scholars specialised in the field of religious interaction. Most medieval societies ruled by Muslims and Christians were religiously plural not by choice and ideal but by nature. Religious affiliation and identity had to be repeatedly negotiated, defined, and chosen. The impact of legitimated religious violence towards subordinate religions or of religious wars underlies the more peaceful periods. Semi-permeable borders between the religions favoured inter-religious exchanges, while at the same time the efforts to impose segregation and discrimination aimed to restrict contact and influence. Agency by members of the subordinate religions was administratively and economically welcome and religiously and socially inevitable.  The authors address topics such as the different strategies for power, order, exchange and identity chosen to organise religious plurality in medieval societies. Rights and regulations by both dominant and subordinate religions for demarcation, and in the opposite direction, pragmatism and forum shopping, were important strategies. A comparative approach stemming from the controversy on the concept of convivencia or coexistence in and beyond the Iberian Peninsula, as a possible model of inter-religious cohabitation, is combined with the inspiring results on religious plurality unearthed by intense research on mixed societies in the Mediterranean, Byzantium, the Crusading States and Central Asia. New theoretical and empirical models and concepts are proposed for comparative work in this research field.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book is a combination of three texts: The root text, The Gradual Path of the Wisdom Essence is oral instructions of Padmasambhava, recorded by his chief female disciple, Yeshe Tsogyal. Padmasambhava established the Buddhist doctrine in Tibet during the eight century. He concealed teachings in the form of hidden treasures, to be revealed at an appropriate time in the future. The Light of Wisdom by JamgOn KongtrUl, one of the most prominent Buddhist masters of nineteenth-century Tibet, is an extensive commentary on this sacred scripture. Entering the Path of Wisdom consists of annotations on the commentary by Jamyang Drakpa, a student of JamgOn KongtrUl, dictated to Jokyab Rinpoche. The root text of Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpo, a terma revealed by the great treasure-finder Chokgyur Lingpa, and its commentary by KongtrUl Rinpoche, the great translator in person, form together a complete scripture that embodies all the tantras, statements and instructions of the Nyingma School of the early translations, which is most rare to find in the past, present, or future ... I find it important that all Dharma practitioners study and reflect upon this book. ' Kyabje Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche It is correct that it will be quite difficult to practice the entire Gradual Path of the Wisdom Essence, so you should use what is directly appropriate for your training. It is never said that you should practice an entire root text as Light of Wisdom contains the complete path for different kinds of individuals, both of Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana. But since its title is the Wisdom Essence, it means that its ultimate practice is Dzogchen. ' Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Unbridled, William Robert uses Equus, Peter Shaffer's enigmatic play about a boy passionately devoted to horses, to think differently about religion. For several years, Robert has used Equus to introduce students to the study of religion, provoking them to conceive of religion in unfamiliar, even uncomfortable ways. In Unbridled, he is inviting readers to do the same. A play like Equus tangles together text, performance, practice, embodiment, and reception. Studying a play involves us in playing different roles, as ourselves and others, and those roles, as well as the imaginative work they require, are critical to the study of religion. By approaching Equus with the reader, turning the play around and upside-down, Unbridled transforms standard approaches to the study of religion, engaging with themes including ritual, sacrifice, worship, power, desire, violence, and sexuality, as well as thinkers including Judith Butler, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jonathan Z. Smith. As Unbridled shows, the way themes and theories play out in Equus challenges us to reimagine the study of religion through open questions, contrasting perspectives, and alternative modes of interpretation and appreciation.

"Evolving brains, emerging gods",E.

Atheist, humanist, and materialist critics, meanwhile, have attempted to turn theology on its head, claiming that religion is a human invention. In this book, E. Fuller Torrey draws on cutting-edge neuroscience research to propose a startling answer to the ultimate question. Evolving Brains, Emerging Gods locates the origin of gods within the human brain, arguing that religious belief is a by-product of evolution.Based on an idea originally proposed by Charles Darwin, Torrey marshals evidence that the emergence of gods was an incidental consequence of several evolutionary factors. Using data ranging from ancient skulls and artifacts to brain imaging, primatology, and child development studies, this book traces how new cognitive abilities gave rise to new behaviors. For instance, autobiographical memory, the ability to project ourselves backward and forward in time, gave Homo sapiens a competitive advantage. However, it also led to comprehension of mortality, spurring belief in an alternative to death. Torrey details the neurobiological sequence that explains why the gods appeared when they did, connecting archaeological findings including clothing, art, farming, and urbanization to cognitive developments. This book does not dismiss belief but rather presents religious belief as an inevitable outcome of brain evolution. Providing clear and accessible explanations of evolutionary neuroscience, Evolving Brains, Emerging Gods will shed new light on the mechanics of our deepest mysteries.

Exploring the fundamental principles of several key religions, this chronicle pursues a singular message that emphasizes the fundamental requirement for peace--respect for God, respect for the human person. Referring to the exploding occurrences of sectarian-fueled violence in every country, leaders of all faiths are forced to answer hard questions about the role of religion in a world that is increasingly becoming a base for unrest and war. Addressing these challenges directly, this thoughtful study simplifies the myriad abstract questions blocking world peace, while validating each argument with real-world solutions--a refreshing reminder that people of all religious devotions can speak together in the name of common peace""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The illusion of God's presence,John C.

More than any rituals or doctrines, it is this experience that anchors religious faith, yet it has been largely ignored in the scientific literature on religion. Biologist John Wathey takes the reader on a scientific journey to find the sources of religious feeling and the illusion of God's presence. His book delves into the biological origins of this compelling feeling, attributing it to innate neural circuitry that evolved to promote the mother-child bond. Dr. Wathey, a veteran neuroscientist, argues that evolution has programmed the infant brain to expect the presence of a loving being who responds to the child's needs. As the infant grows into adulthood, this innate feeling is eventually transferred to the realm of religion, where it is reactivated through the symbols, imagery, and rituals of worship. The author interprets our various conceptions of God in biological terms as illusory supernormal stimuli that fill an emotional and cognitive vacuum left over from infancy.

Edward J. Watts traces their experiences of living through the fourth century's dramatic religious and political changes, when heated confrontations saw the Christian establishment legislate against pagan practices as mobs attacked pagan holy sites and temples. The emperors who issued these laws, the imperial officials charged with implementing them, and the Christian perpetrators of religious violence were almost exclusively young men whose attitudes and actions contrasted markedly with those of the earlier generation, who shared neither their juniors' interest in creating sharply defined religious identities nor their propensity toward violent conflict. Watts examines why the 'final pagan generation'-born to the old ways and the old world in which it seemed to everyone that religious practices would continue as they had for the last two thousand years--proved both unable to anticipate the changes that imperially sponsored Christianity produced and unwilling to resist them. A compelling and provocative read, suitable for the general reader as well as students and scholars of the ancient world""--Provided by publisher.

The collected essays portray existence at different points across India's northern frontiers and, in one instance, along borders within India. Whether discussing Shi'i Muslims striving to be patriotic Indians in the Kashmiri district of Kargil or Bangladeshis living uneasily in an enclave surrounded by Indian territory, the contributors show that state borders in Northern South Asia are complex sites of contestation. India's borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma/Myanmar, China, and Nepal encompass radically different ways of life, a whole spectrum of relationships to the state, and many struggles with urgent identity issues. Taken together, the essays show how, by looking at state-making in diverse, border-related contexts, it is possible to comprehend Northern South Asia's various nation-state projects without relapsing into conventional nationalist accounts.

Now Terryl Givens offers a full-length treatment of this highly influential work, illuminating  many facets of this uniquely Americanscripture.       Givens examines the Book of Mormon's role as a divine testament of the Last Days and as a sacred sign of Joseph Smith's status as a modern-day prophet. He assesses its claim to be a history of the pre-Columbian peopling of the Western Hemisphere, first by a small Old World group in the era ofBabel, and later by tribes from Jerusalem in the age of Jeremiah. Givens explores how the Book of Mormon has been defined as a cultural product, the imaginative ravings of a rustic religion-maker more inspired by the winds of culture than the breath of God...

They would, he said, leave behind security, money, convenience, even family for him. They would abandon everything for the gospel. They would take up their crosses daily...BUT WHO DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVES LIKE THAT? DO YOU?In Radical, David Platt challenges you to consider with an open heart how we have manipulated the gospel to fit our cultural preferences. He shows what Jesus actually said about being his disciple--then invites you to believe and obey what you have heard. And he tells the dramatic story of what is happening as a ""successful"" suburban church decides to get serious about the gospel according to Jesus.Finally, he urges you to join in The Radical Experiment --a one-year journey in authentic discipleship that will transform how you live in a world that desperately needs the Good News Jesus came to bring.From the Trade Paperback edition.

After introductory chapters that approach the subject from conceptual and historical angles, the book then discusses what Revelation says about the woman who, in the fullness of time, bore in her womb the pre-existent Son of God. There follows a study of Mary's perfections, such as the Church believes them; these chapters are written in a 'genetic' way, examining how appreciation of each perfection developed over the past two thousand years. The last chapter deals with Marian devotion.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Our new clothing reminds us of the truth of who we are in Him and the amazing spiritual transformation that has already begun inside of us when we became born-again daughters of the King of Kings. The problem is that too few of us as believers truly understand how to wear this amazing new wardrobe. Our personal identity is far too often found in what we see in our fleshy mirrors rather than the beautiful mirror of the word of God that tells us a love story so real and so true that it overwhelms the natural mind""--Cover   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dadashri has described the concept of ‘paap-punya’ in simple words as giving happiness to others we incur punya and giving trouble anyone, hurting anyone by our words, deeds or behaviour, we incur paap. However, if we do pratikraman (whole hearted repentance) we can get rid of paap and bind punya.  What is the detailed meaning of paap-punya? How is it related to incarnation? What are the results of paap-punya? How does one have to face the consequences of paap-punya? What are the types of paap-punya? What role paap-punya plays in the path to Moksha? Can Punya give us liberation?  All these have been revealed by Param Pujya Dadashri in this book on Paap-Punya. Such reading will definitely help readers increase their awareness about paap-punya which will help answer many puzzles in life and get them closer to Moksha.
