More than 20 years ago, celebrated author Kathy Stinson wrote in a positive way about the confusion, insecurity and sorrow experienced by young children whose parents have separated. Since then, Mom and Dad Don't Live Together Anymore has brought comfort to countless families dealing with this difficult issue. This critically acclaimed best-seller, reprinted 15 times, now returns with fresh new illustrations and updated text.  For the young girl of the story, splitting time between parents has its ups and downs. She likes the elevators and garbage chutes of mom's city apartment, but the horses near dad's country home are great, too. Not knowing where she'll be for holidays is hard. Even so, she is comforted knowing that each parent still provides the same love and caring --just not together anymore.  Sensitively told and featuring reassuring illustrations, Mom and Dad Don't Live Together Anymore offers children a gentle entry into an upsetting subject.

The truth about Florence reveals that she was an often difficult and always demanding woman. She was opinionated and fought fiercely to win the battles set before her. Florence's privileged childhood was often unhappy for the young woman who questioned everything about herself and her environment., Only after many miserable years as a young adult was she able to convince her parents to let her be a nurse. Florence worked with intense energy to improve the hospital conditions in the Crimeon Peninsula. She supervised her nurses as they gave the patients basic care. She did this successfully even though the military doctors did not want a ""society lady"" telling them how to run their hospitals.

The tale of his adventures has been retold countless times over the centuries. Yet it remains as exciting as it was when the Greek storyteller Homer first recited it close to three thousand years ago. In the great epic the Iliad, Odysseus is one of the Greek kings who attack the famous city of Troy. After winning the Trojan War, Odysseus and his soldiers encounter a terrible storm and their ships are blown off course. Lost, they wander from one strange and dangerous place to another for ten long years. As told in Homer's immortal epic, the Odyssey, they fight one-eyed giants, zombie-like cannibals, and other frightening monsters. But the clever and brave Odysseus never gives up hope of returning to his beloved home and family.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
