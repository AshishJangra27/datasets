More than 20 years ago, celebrated author Kathy Stinson wrote in a positive way about the confusion, insecurity and sorrow experienced by young children whose parents have separated. Since then, Mom and Dad Don't Live Together Anymore has brought comfort to countless families dealing with this difficult issue. This critically acclaimed best-seller, reprinted 15 times, now returns with fresh new illustrations and updated text.  For the young girl of the story, splitting time between parents has its ups and downs. She likes the elevators and garbage chutes of mom's city apartment, but the horses near dad's country home are great, too. Not knowing where she'll be for holidays is hard. Even so, she is comforted knowing that each parent still provides the same love and caring --just not together anymore.  Sensitively told and featuring reassuring illustrations, Mom and Dad Don't Live Together Anymore offers children a gentle entry into an upsetting subject.

The truth about Florence reveals that she was an often difficult and always demanding woman. She was opinionated and fought fiercely to win the battles set before her. Florence's privileged childhood was often unhappy for the young woman who questioned everything about herself and her environment., Only after many miserable years as a young adult was she able to convince her parents to let her be a nurse. Florence worked with intense energy to improve the hospital conditions in the Crimeon Peninsula. She supervised her nurses as they gave the patients basic care. She did this successfully even though the military doctors did not want a ""society lady"" telling them how to run their hospitals.

All the important decisions in their lives were made by men. They could not vote and give their opinion on who should run the country.

These are the stories of five trailblazers who achieved amazing things in difficult circumstances: Elizabeth Cady Stanton began campaigning for women's rights when she was refused entry to a convention because she was a women. Susan B Anthony cast her vote knowing she'd be arrested. Clementina Black organized a strike at a factory that paid women low wages.

The Vikings came from Scandinavia, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They invaded and settled in Northern Scotland and the East of England looking for farmland. The Viking age in Europe ran from around AD 700 to 1100. Vikings arrived in longships and attacked small villages, following a sustained campaign of attack. The Vikings famously settled in York, building houses and establishing trades such as jewellery and pottery making and woodworking. Women were important in Viking family life. They ran the home and farm while their husbands were away trading or fighting. Throughout the Viking age there were many battles between the Vikings and the English with King Alfred preventing them from taking over all of England. In the 10th century England won back much of the land taken, defeating Eric Bloodaxe, the last Viking King of Jorvik. Viking rule ended with the invasion of Britain by the Normans in 1066.
