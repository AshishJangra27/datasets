He was everything she was not - sophisticated, urbane, powerful - and yet she found herself responding to his magnetism in a way no unawakened girl should. He seemed to wield a power that she did not understand, and it was not until he forced her to recognise the truth for herself that Marina realised what was happening to her, and what had happened.

An acute observer of the professional music scene, Freeman argues that music schools that train our future instrumentalists, composers, conductors, and singers need to equip their students with the communications and analytical skills they need to succeed in the rapidly changing music scene. This book maps a broad range of reforms required in the field of advanced music education and the organizations responsible for that education.  Featuring a foreword by Leonard Slatkin, music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, The Crisis of Classical Music in America speaks to parents, prospective and current music students, music teachers and professors, department deans, university presidents and provosts, and even foundations and public organizations that fund such music programs. This book reaches out to all of these stakeholders and argues for meaningful change though wide-spread collaboration.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Reviving mid-century discussions of the ?middlebrow,? Chowrimootoo demonstrates how these works allowed audiences to have their modernist cake and eat it: to revel in the pleasures of consonance, lyricism and theatrical spectacle, even while enjoying the prestige that came from rejecting them. By focusing on moments when reigning aesthetic oppositions and hierarchies threatened to collapse, Middlebrow Modernism offers a powerful model for recovering shades of grey in the black-and-white historiographies of twentieth-century music.

Disco may have presented itself as shallow and disposable--the platforms, polyester, and plastic vibe of it all--but the disco scene carved out a haven for gay men who reclaimed their sexuality on dance floors where they had once been surveilled and harassed; it thrust black women onto center stage as some of the genre's most prominent stars; and it paved the way for the opening of Studio 54 and the viral popularity of the shoestring-budget Saturday Night Fever, a movie that challenged traditional notions of masculinity, even for heterosexuals. But while exploring the cultural milieu, Echols never loses sight of the era's defining soundtrack, which propelled popular music into new sonic territory, influencing everything from rap and rock to techno and trance""--Publisher description.

Life on Planet Rock describes how Friend, the editor of RIP, became the Zelig-like chronicler of the biggest musical moments of that time--from introducing Guns N' Roses (in nothing but a top hat, underwear, and cowboy boots) to sitting in during the making of Metallica's ""Black Album.""  Life on Planet Rock provides revealing portraits of artists as varied as Kurt Cobain, Gene Simmons, Alice Cooper, Axl Rose, James Hetfield, Steven Tyler, and many more. Part oral history, part candid and humorous memoir, it is a wormhole back to a fast-moving time in music that saw tastes flash from new wave to hair metal to grunge, told as only someone who was there through it all could tell it.

This intaglio printing technique not only allowed him to print on demand, but also to combine different kinds of notation on one page opening: voice parts with corresponding harpsichord and lute intabulations. This detailed comparison of intaglio and relief printing techniques in the editions associated with Verovio sheds light on the production of sheet music around 1600 and the comparison of the vocal and instrumental parts provides ground-breaking insights into historical performance practice.

Sometimes you can grow up in just one night…It is 16th August 1977 – the day that Elvis dies – and Terry is back from Berlin, basking in the light of his friendship with legendary rock star Dag Wood. But when Dag arrives in London he sets his sights on a mysterious young photographer called Misty, the girl that Terry loves. Will the love of Terry's life survive this hot summer's night?

Hiding out in a disco called The Goldmine, Leon meets Ruby – the dancing queen of his dreams. But will true love or the Dagenham Dogs find Leon before the night is over?

More than ten million albums sold. Named one of the greatest singers and songwriters of all time by Rolling Stone. Joni: The Anthology is an essential collection of writings on Joni Mitchell that charts every major moment of the famed troubadour's extraordinary career, as it happened. From album reviews, incisive commentary, and candid conversations, Joni: The Anthology includes, among other things, a review of Mitchell's first-ever show at LA's Troubadour in June of 1968, a 1978 interview by musician Ben Sidran on jazz great Charles Mingus, a personal reminiscence by Ellen Sander, a confidant of the Los Angeles singer-songwriter community, and a long ""director's cut"" version of editor Barney Hoskyns' 1994 MOJO interview. A time capsule of an icon, the anthology spans the entirety of Joni's career between 1967-2007, as well as thoughtful commentary on her early years. In collecting materials long unavailable, rare, or otherwise difficult to find, Joni: The Anthology illuminates the evolution of modern rock journalism while providing an invaluable and accessible guide to appreciating the highs--and the lows--of a twentieth century legend."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As a white, foreign-born writer without money or bling, he would seem the least likely rap impresario imaginable, yet he plunges into this violent and poverty-ravaged world as a would-be producer. His passionate involvement with the music and the people who make it leads him through a New Orleans--wards, clubs, and projects--hidden from anyone not born to it: a journey into the heart of the hip-hop dream. En route, he immerses us in lives we scarcely think about, and then only with ignorance and fear, lives at once desperate, heroic, and endlessly enterprising as these men and women driven by talent and passion struggle to survive. Cohn captures a music that's hugely popular but rarely understood, and with transcendent humanity he reveals this beloved city in all its tragic beauty.From the Hardcover edition.

It's hope.""All art exists to make life more bearable. For Alison Kinney, it was the wild, fantastical world of opera that transformed her listening and her life. Whether we're listening for the first time or revisiting the arias that first stole our hearts, Avidly Reads Opera welcomes readers and listeners to a community full of friendship, passion, critique--and, always, beautiful music. In times of delirious, madcap fun and political turmoil, opera fans have expressed their passion by dispatching records into the cosmos, building fairy-tale castles, and singing together through the arduous work of social activism. Avidly Reads Opera is a love letter to the music and those who love it, complete with playlists, a crowdsourced tip sheet from ultra-fans to newbies, and stories of the turbulent, genre-busting, and often hilarious history of opera and its audiences.Across five acts--and the requisite intermission--Alison Kinney takes us everywhere opera's rich melodies are heard, from the cozy bedrooms of listeners at home, to exclusive music festivals, to protests, and even prisons. Part of the Avidly Reads series, this slim book gives us a new way of looking at culture. With the singular blend of personal reflection and cultural criticism featured in the series, Avidly Reads Opera is an homage to the marvelous, sensational world of opera for the casual viewer.

Published over the span of the past 25 years, the selected articles provide a historical conspectus about a range of vital topics in the history of music theory, focusing in particular upon writings from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Christensen examines a variety of theorists and their arguments within the intellectual and musical contexts of their time, in the process highlighting the diverse and idiosyncratic nature of the discipline of music theory itself. In the first section of the book Christensen offers general reflections on the meaning and interpretation of historical music theories, with especial attention paid to their value for music theorists today. The second section of the book contains a number of articles that consider the catalytic role of the thorough bass in the development of harmonic theory during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the final two sections of the anthology, focus turns to the writings of several individual music theorists, including Marin Mersenne, Seth Calvisius, Johann Mattheson, Johann Nicolaus Bach, Denis Diderot and Johann Nichelmann. The volume includes essays from hard-to-find publications as well as newly-translated material and the articles are prefaced by a new, wide-ranging autobiographical essay by the author that offers a broad re-assessment of his historical project. This book is essential reading for music theorists and seventeenth- and eighteenth-century musicologists.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The trouble is she's running it for Marty Sayles, a powerful drug dealer who controls the Eastside with a fist. When Frankie strikes up a relationship with Johnny Falco, the owner of one of the only Vancouver clubs willing to give punk a chance, she finds out he's having his own money problems just keeping Falco's Nest open. Desperate to keep his club, Johnny raids one of the pot fields Marty Sayles has growing out past Surrey, along Zero Avenue on the U.S. border. He gets away with a pickup load and pays back everybody he owes. Arnie Binz, bass player for Middle Finger, finds out about it and decides that was easy enough. But he gets caught by Marty's crew. Johnny and Frankie set out to find the missing Arnie, but Marty Sayles is pissed and looking for who ripped off his other field - a trail that leads to Johnny and Frankie.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

There have, however, been few attempts to specify this power empirically and to provide theoretically grounded accounts of music's structuring properties in everyday experience. Music in Everyday Life uses a series of ethnographic studies - an aerobics class, karaoke evenings, music therapy sessions and the use of background music in the retail sector - as well as in-depth interviews to show how music is a constitutive feature of human agency. Drawing together concepts from psychology, sociology and socio-linguistics it develops a theory of music's active role in the construction of personal and social life and highlights the aesthetic dimension of social order and organisation in late modern societies.

Prieberg liefert eine »politische Musikgeschichte« der Jahre 1933–45 in Deutschland bis hin zu den im Krieg besetzten Ländern. Anhand typischer Lebensläufe von Komponisten, Dirigenten und Musikschriftstellern wird gezeigt, daß jede Art von Karriere nur im Hinblick auf politische Nützlichkeit gelingen konnte, sei es durch Ergebenheitsadressen, durch Hitlerkantaten, Soldatenlieder etc. Daneben gab es aber auch geschützte Ecken, in denen Künstler »undeutsch« agieren konnten, sofern es deutsche oder »nordische« Künstler waren: So gingen selbst Hindemithscher Stil und Zwölftontechnik, sogar Jazz unbemerkt oder zumindest ungerügt durch.

Andrea Avery, already a promising and ambitious classical pianist at twelve, was diagnosed with a severe case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that threatened not just her musical aspirations but her ability to live a normal life. As Andrea navigates the pain and frustration of coping with RA alongside the usual travails of puberty, college, sex, and just growing-up, she turns to music--specifically Franz Schubert's sonata in B-flat D960, and the one-armed pianist Paul Wittgenstein for strength and inspiration. The heartbreaking story of this mysterious sonata--Schubert's last, and his most elusive and haunting--is the soundtrack of Andrea's story. Sonata is a breathtaking exploration of a ""Janus-head miracle""--Andrea's extraordinary talent and even more extraordinary illness. With no cure for her RA possible, Andrea must learn to live with this disease while not letting it define her, even though it leaves its mark on everyting around her--family, relationships, even the clothes she wears. Yet in this riveting account, she never loses her wit, humor, or the raw artistry of a true performer.""--Book jacket inside flap.

On the one hand, scholars of this period were inspired by classical narratives on the sublime effects of music and, on the other hand, were affected by the profound religious upheavals which destroyed the unity of Western Christianity and, in so doing, opened up new avenues in the world of music. These articles offer as broad a vision as possible of the ways of thinking about music which developed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. - Publisher.

Writing as a fan, a musician, and a scholar, Gossett, the world's leading authority on the performance of Italian opera, brings colorfully to life the problems, and occasionally the scandals, that attend the production of some of our most favorite operas.Gossett begins by tracing the social history of nineteenth-century Italian theaters in order to explain the nature of the musical scores from which performers have long worked. He then illuminates the often hidden but crucial negotiations opera scholars and opera conductors and performers: What does it mean to talk about performing from a critical edition? How does one determine what music to perform when multiple versions of an opera exist? What are the implications of omitting passages from an opera in a performance? In addition to vexing questions such as these, Gossett also tackles issues of ornamentation and transposition in vocal style, the matters of translation and adaptation, and even aspects of stage direction and set design.Throughout this extensive and passionate work, Gossett enlivens his history with reports from his own experiences with major opera companies at venues ranging from the Metropolitan and Santa Fe operas to the Rossini Opera Festival at Pesaro. The result is a book that will enthrall both aficionados of Italian opera and newcomers seeking a reliable introduction to it—in all its incomparable grandeur and timeless allure.

Two years after the events of The Bishop's Man, we're introduced to Effie MacAskill Gillis, sister of the troubled priest Duncan. It's 1997, and Effie is an independent, middle-aged woman working as a tenured professor of Celtic Studies, but her complicated and often disappointing love life has left her all but ready to give up on the opposite sex. Then suddenly, a chance encounter with a man on a Toronto subway platform gives Effie renewed hope. J.C. Campbell is an old friend she hasn't seen for more than 20 years - an attractive, single man who appears to possess the stability and good sense she longs for. Effie met her last husband, Sextus, in her hometown of Cape Breton when the two were still children. As they grew older together, and started a family, she soon learned that when it came to other women, Sextus couldn't be trusted. After one too many betrayals, Effie leaves him behind, and so when she and J.C. seem to hit it off, his relaxed, open demeanour is a welcome change. But after a happy start to their relationship, cracks begin to show, and J.C. proves himself to be just as unpredictable as the others: one evening Effie spots him in a seedy part of town, but he denies ever having left his house; when she notices a scratch below his eye, he lies about its cause, blaming it on the cat. Then J.C., a journalist, becomes unhealthily engrossed in a story involving a convict on death row, and he and Effie begin to drift apart. Although he still checks in sporadically and insists there's nothing going on, she soon learns he has a deeply personal reason for his covert trips to that seedy downtown street. In fact, it turns out there's a lot about his past that Effie doesn't know, and a lot he's still learning himself. While J.C. is busy chasing his own past, Effie is rarely able to escape her own. Family ties and hometown connections to Cape Breton mean her two ex-husbands - Sextus happens to be the cousin of her first husband, John - are constantly coming and going in a turbulent mess of comfort and commotion, while her grown daughter, Cassie, brings some unexpected news of her own. After all of her experience in relationships with men, Effie thought she knew all she needed to about what to expect, and how to maintain her self-sufficiency. Why do men lie?, she wants to know. But whether it's for love, for protection, or for more selfish reasons, Effie soon learns that no amount of experience can prepare you for what might resurface from the past, and for the damage that might cause, emotionally or otherwise.

Rock music mirrors the tradition of nineteenth-century Romaniticsm, Robert Patison says. Whitman's ""barbaric yawp"" can still be heard in the punk rock of the Ramones, and the spirit that inspired Poe's Eureka lives on in the lyrics of Talking Heads. Rock is vulgar, Pattison notes, and vulgarity is something that high culture has long despised but rarely bothered to define. This book is the first effort since John Ruskin and Aldous Huxley to describe in depth what vulgarity is, and how, with the help of ideas inherent in Romaniticism, it has slipped the constraints imposed on it by refined culture and established its own loud arts. The book disassembles the various myths of rock: its roots in black and folk music; the primacy it accords to feeling and self; the sexual omnipotence of rock stars; the satanic predilictions of rock fans; and rock's high-voltage image of the modern Prometheus wielding an electric guitar. Pattison treats these myths as vulgar counterparts of their originals in refined Romantic art and offers a description and justification of rock's central place in the social and aesthetic structure of modern culture. At a time when rock lyrics have provoked parental outrage and senatorial hearings, The Triumph of Vulgarity is required reading for anyone interested in where rock comes from and how it works. - Publisher.

Spence,music,First published in 1997,/works/OL2570671W,/authors/OL250886A/H._T._Spence,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9827809M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Forwarding the Faith Publications|Language English|Pages 175,"My desire in this unpretentious manuscript is to present a ""principia"" handbook for Christian students and teachers in the light of their generation's music. Five chapters are dedicated to biblical principles in the context of our contemporary. Biblical principles must be seen before we will see what is happening both in the world and, more specifically, in the conservative churches across our land. If these early chapters are not read, the following chapters will reap no true appreciation and understanding, for out of ""principle"" comes ""conviction""'; otherwise, conviction is simply a bias or prejudicial belief. The remaining chapters will focus on the subject of music itself. Three chapters deal with the history and philosophy of secular rock, a more pointed analogy of the world-wide powerful influence of the Beatles, and the rise of deva music in rock culture. Another chapter presents the history of music through church history, followed by a chapter presenting the birth and growth of ""gospel music,"" and the final chapter deals with the history and present trends in fundamentalist music. A ""postlude"" concludes my thoughts in the light of a present need and future hope. - Back cover.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

S. Bach (1980), a bestselling title, which has subsequently become a classic text. This new edition takes account of the Bach scholarship of the last 25 years. Peter Williams's piece-by-piece commentary puts the musical sources of the organ works in context, describing the form and content of each work and relating them to other music, German and non-German. He summarises the questions about the history, authenticity, chronology, function and performance of each piece, and points out important details of style and musical quality. The study follows the order of the Bach catalogue (BWV), beginning with the sonatas, then the 'free works', followed by chorales and ending with the doubtful works, including the 'newly discovered chorales' of 1985.

Including many new details and eyewitness accounts never before published, as well as keen insight into the Nashville cats who helped Dylan reach rare artistic heights, it explores the lasting impact of rock’s first double album. Based on exhaustive research and in-depth interviews with the producer, the session musicians, studio personnel, management personnel, and others, Daryl Sanders chronicles the road that took Dylan from New York to Nashville in search of “that thin, wild mercury sound.” As Dylan told Playboy in 1978, the closest he ever came to capturing that sound was during the Blonde on Blonde sessions, where the voice of a generation was backed by musicians of the highest order.""--Dust jacket flap.

She expresses regret over her passivity within the band Jerk Alert, and excitedly tries out for then anguishes over her failed audition tape to participate in a Belle & Sebastian project. She dwells over her physical insecurities as well as admiration/admitted jealousy over her now distant feminist friends and powerful women in media or history like Edie Sedwick. Weighing what makes or breaks grounded depictions of women onscreen, She’s So Very... reviews television and film characters in Buffy, Gilmore Girls, Kill Bill, Veronica Mars, Sin City, Charlie’s Angels and Itty Bitty Titty Committee, which had just screened at the Indianapolis LGBT film festival. She considers her interest in and simultaneous disgust with pornography, and how it affects her relationship with Sassafrassy.

""From the best-selling author of Fosse, a sweeping yet intimate--and often hilarious--history of a uniquely American art form that has never been more popular. At the height of the McCarthy era, an experimental theater troupe set up shop in a bar near the University of Chicago. Via word of mouth, astonished crowds packed the ad hoc venue to see its unscripted, interactive, consciousness-raising style. From this unlikely seed grew the Second City, the massively influential comedy ensemble, and its offshoots--the Groundlings, Upright Citizens Brigade, SNL, and a slew of others. Sam Wasson charts the meteoric rise of improv in this richly reported, scene-driven narrative that, like its subject, moves fast and digs deep. He shows us the chance meeting at a train station between Mike Nichols and Elaine May. We hang out at the after-hours bar Dan Aykroyd opened so that friends like John Belushi, Bill Murray, and Gilda Radner would always have a home. We go behind the scenes of landmark entertainments, from The Graduate to Caddyshack, The Forty-Year-Old Virgin to The Colbert Report. Along the way, we commune with a host of pioneers--Nichols, Harold Ramis, Dustin Hoffman, Chevy Chase, Steve Carell, Amy Poehler, Alan Arkin, Tina Fey, Judd Apatow, and many others. With signature verve and nuance, Wasson shows why improv deserves to be considered the great American art form of the last half century--and the most influential one today.""--Dust jacket flap.

A Musicology of Performance,Dorottya Fabian,music,First published in 2015,/works/OL20930545W,/authors/OL3289257A/Dorottya_Fabian,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL46534118M-M.jpg,Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Language English|Pages 354,"""This book examines the nature of musical performance. In it, Dorottya Fabian explores the contributions and limitations of some of these approaches to performance, be they theoretical, cultural, historical, perceptual, or analytical. Through a detailed investigation of recent recordings of J. S. Bach?s Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, she demonstrates that music performance functions as a complex dynamical system. Only by crossing disciplinary boundaries, therefore, can we put the aural experience into words. A Musicology of Performance provides a model for such a method by adopting Deleuzian concepts and various empirical and interdisciplinary procedures. Fabian provides a case study in the repertoire, while presenting new insights into the state of baroque performance practice at the turn of the twenty-first century. Through its wealth of audio examples, tables, and graphs, the book offers both a sensory and a scholarly account of musical performance. These interactive elements map the connections between historically informed and mainstream performance styles, considering them in relation to broader cultural trends, violin schools, and individual artistic trajectories.    A Musicology of Performance is a must read for academics and post-graduate students and an essential reference point for the study of music performance, the early music movement, and Bach?s opus.""

This study considers how queer readings are reinforced or nuanced through analysis of musical score. Taking a broad approach to queerness that questions heteronormative and homonormative patriarchal structures, binary relationships, gender assumptions and anxieties, this book challenges existing interpretations of what is progressive and what is retrogressive in cinema. Examined films include Bride of Frankenstein, Louisiana Story, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Blazing Saddles, Edward Scissorhands, Brokeback Mountain, Boys Don't Cry, Transamerica, Thelma & Louise, Go Fish and The Living End, with special attention given to films that subvert or complicate genre. Music is analyzed with concern for composition, intertextual references, absolute musical structures, song lyrics, recording, arrangement, and performance issues. This multidisciplinary work, featuring groundbreaking research, analysis, and theory, offers new close readings and a model for future scholarship""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Strange things happen: a life with the Police, polo, and pygmies",Stewart Copeland,music,First published in 2009,/works/OL8563410W,/authors/OL2872080A/Stewart_Copeland,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24249950M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  HarperStudio|Language English,"When Stewart Copeland gets dressed, he has an identity crisis. Should he put on ""leather pants, hostile shirts, and pointy shoes""? Or wear something more appropriate to the ""tax-paying, property-owning, investment-holding lotus eater"" his success has allowed him to become? This dilemma is at the heart of Copeland's vastly entertaining memoir-in-stories, Strange Things Happen. The world knows Copeland as the drummer for The Police, one of the most successful bands in rock history. But they may not know as much about his childhood in the Middle East as the son of a CIA agent. Or be aware of his film-making adventures with the Pygmies in the deepest reaches of the Congo, and his passion for polo (Brideshead Revisited on horses). In Strange Things Happen we move from Copeland's remarkable childhood to the formation of The Police, their rise to stardom, and the settled-down life that followed. It ends with a behind-the-scenes view of The Police's extraordinarily successful reunion tour. It's a book of amazing anecdotes, all completely true, which take us backstage in a life that is fully lived.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

American popular music,Rachel Rubin,music,First published in 2001,/works/OL15862049W?edition=ia%3Aamericanpopularm00rubi,/authors/OL5219689A/Rachel_Rubin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24770715M-M.jpg,Publish Date June 2001|Publisher  University of Massachusetts Press|Language English|Pages 280,"Designed as a broad introductory survey, and written by experts in the field, this book examines the rise of American music over the past hundred years--the period in which that music came into its own and achieved unprecedented popularity. Beginning with a look at music as a business, eleven essays explore a variety of musical genres, including Tin Pan Alley, blues, jazz, country, gospel, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, folk, rap, and Mexican American corridos. Reading these essays, we come to see that the forms created by one group often appeal to, and are in turn influenced by, other groups, across lines of race, ethnicity, class, gender, region, and age. The chapters speak to one another, arguing for the primacy of such concepts as minstrelsy, urbanization, hybridity, and crossover as the most powerful tools for understanding American popular music.

W. Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 194,"In this book, Aaron Copland provides an introduction to the formative ideas of our century, and a survey of recent and current trends. He shows first of all how contemporary music grew naturally out of the work of such masters as Mussorgsky and Debussy, through Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartók, Hindemith, to the work Of younger Americans and others.  Then the author discusses individually certain leading composers of Europe and America. A special section is devoted to six outstanding Americans, together with a discussion of Carlos Chávez and a review of certain aspects of Mr. Copland’s own career as a composer. The closing section deals with developments in new musical media—serialism, “chance” music, and electronic music.  The book is based on an earlier work by Mr. Copland, Our New Music. The author has added new material, bringing each subject up to date and discussing important changes that have taken place. Schoenberg, Bartók, Hindemith, and other composers are seen from a new vantage point. Dodecaphonic developments are discussed. The famous autobiographical essay, “Composer from Brooklyn,” has been brought up to date. The result is a brilliant panorama of twentieth-century music.

The groups and artists who took the music both to new heights and depths are discussed and the events which shaped the development of the music are charted. There are detailed accounts of the music's major figures, including Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Led Zeppelin, and lavish Illustrations throughout to make this a truly comprehensive chronicle of the music of our time."" --Dust Jacket.

"A discourse on the divine ordinance of singing Psalms: Intended to prove, I. That the singing of Psalms is a part of that social or publick worship which God hath appointed in his word. II. That there are parts of the sacred Scriptures adapted to the purpose of singing, which ought to be used in the publick worship of the church, till the end of time. III. That the Scripture songs are the only forms of psalmody, which ought to be used in the solemn and publick worship of the church. IV. That, in the publick praises of the church, the musick, or outward part, ought to be conducted with decency and simplicity; and in subserviency to the spiritual part, which is chiefly to be regarded. : To which is added, an appendix, in two numbers. No. I. contains a brief history of psalmody. No. II. contains a review of Dr. Watts's Imitation of the Psalms of David, as corrected and enlarged by Joel Barlow.","Anderson, John",music,First published in 1791,/works/OL187174W?edition=ia%3Addivin00ande,/authors/OL2185498A/Anderson_John,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL33152084M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1791|Publisher  Printed by William Young|Language English|Pages 112,This edition doesn't have a description yet.

"Race, class, and political symbols",Anita M. Waters,music,First published in 1985,/works/OL5364766W,/authors/OL1235582A/Anita_M._Waters,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL2853845M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Dr. Waters is one of a new breed of analysts for whom the interpenetration of politics, culture, and national development is key to a larger integration of social research. Race, Class, and Political Symbols is a remarkably cogent examination of the uses of Rastafarian symbols and reggae music in Jamaican electoral campaigns. The author describes and analyzes the way Jamaican politicians effectively employ improbable strategies for electoral success. She includes interviews with reggae musicians, Rastafarian leaders, government and party officials, and campaign managers. Jamaican democracy and politics are fused to its culture; hence campaign advertisements, reggae songs, party pamphlets, and other documents are part of the larger picture of Caribbean life and letters. This volume centers and comes to rest on the adoption of Rastafarian symbols in the context of Jamaica's democratic institutions, which are characterized by vigorous campaigning, electoral fraud, and gang violence. In recent national elections, such violence claimed the lives of hundreds of people. Significant issues are dealt with in this cultural setting: race differentials among Whites, Browns, and Blacks; the rise of anti-Cubanism; the Rastafarians' response to the use of their symbols; and the current status of Rastafarian ideological legitimacy.""--Provided by publisher.

Anderson here illuminates the place of musicians and music-making in Greek life from the Archaic to the Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman periods. In his treatment of the musicians, Anderson addresses such topics as their costumes and sacral robes, their affinities with shamans and gods, the nature of their identification with the individual (the ""outsider"") or with the group, and their status as slaves or as freeborn citizens. As part of the larger picture, he discusses their instruments, principally the lyre or kithara and the double reed pipes, and he introduces the musical practices of other cultures as suggestive parallels. Appendices include technical descriptions of the instruments, details of scale-building and notation, and fragmentary remains of actual texts with notation, among them settings of passages from Euripides' tragedies.

The Grateful Dead rose to greatness under the inspired leadership of guitarist Jerry Garcia, but the band very nearly died along with him. When Garcia passed away suddenly in August of 1995, the remaining band members experienced full crises of confidence and identity. So long defined by Garcia's vision for the group, the surviving ""Core Four,"" as they came to be called, were reduced to conflicting agendas, strained relationships, and catastrophic business decisions that would leave the iconic band in utter disarray. Wrestling with how best to define their living legacy, the band made many attempts at restructuring, but it would take twenty years before relationships were mended enough for the Grateful Dead as fans remembered them to once again take the stage. Acclaimed music journalist and New York Times bestselling author Joel Selvin was there for much of the turmoil following Garcia's death, and he offers a behind-the-scenes account of the ebbs and flows that occurred during the ensuing two decades. Plenty of books have been written about the rise of the Grateful Dead, but this final chapter of the band's history has never before been explored in detail. Culminating in the landmark tour bearing the same name, Fare Thee Well charts the arduous journey from Garcia's passing all the way up to the uneasy agreement between the Core Four that led to the series of shows celebrating the band's fiftieth anniversary and finally allowing for a proper, and joyous, sendoff of the group revered by so many.""--Dust jacket flap   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Do I really need my own website - can't I just use MySpace? How do I copyright and license my songs? The DIY Music Manual has the answers to these questions ... and more.Over the last couple of years, the face of independent music has changed completely. With the rise of websites such as MySpace and iTunes, digital radio stations, podcasts, band websites and online music stores, it has made music much easier to make, promote and distribute outside traditional channels. Whereas before it was a case of sending your band's demo tape to a record label and hoping for the best, now it's possible to cut out the middle man and make a success of your band without being signed. Clearly, concisely and with a dash of wit, The DIY Music Manual tells you exactly how to do that.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life,Geoffrey C. Ward,music,First published in 2008,/works/OL14993084W,/authors/OL112697A/Geoffrey_C._Ward,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24276144M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Random House Publishing Group|Language English,"""In this book I hope to reach a new audience with the positive message of America's greatest music, to show how great musicians demonstrate on the bandstand a mutual respect and trust that can alter your outlook on the world and enrich every aspect of your life--from individual creativity and personal relationships to conducting business and understanding what it means to be American in the most modern sense.""--Wynton MarsalisIn this beautiful book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning musician and composer Wynton Marsalis explores jazz and how an understanding of it can lead to deeper, more original ways of being, living, and relating--for individuals, communities, and nations. Marsalis shows us how to listen to jazz, and through stories about his life and the lessons he has learned from other music greats, he reveals how the central ideas in jazz can influence the way people think and even how they behave with others, changing self, family, and community for the better. At the heart of jazz is the expression of personality and individuality, coupled with an ability to listen to and improvise with others. Jazz as an art--and as a way to move people and nations to higher ground--is at the core of this unique, illuminating, and inspiring book, a master class on jazz and life by a brilliant American artist. Advance praise for Moving to Higher Ground""An absolute joy to read. Intimate, knowledgeable, supremely worthy of its subject. In addition to demolishing mediocre, uniformed critics, Moving to Higher Ground is a meaningful contribution to music scholarship.""--Toni Morrison""I think it should be in every bookstore, music store, and school in the country."" --Tony Bennett ""Jazz, for Wynton Marsalis, is nothing less than a search for wisdom. He thinks as forcefully, and as elegantly, as he swings. When he reflects on improvisation, his subject is freedom. When he reflects on harmony, his subject is diversity and conflict and peace. When he reflects on the blues, his subject is sorrow and the mastery of it--how to be happy without being blind. There is philosophy in Marsalis's trumpet, and in this book. Here is the lucid and probing voice of an uncommonly soulful man.""--Leon Wieseltier, literary editor, The New Republic ""Wynton Marsalis is absolutely the person who should write this book. Here he is, as young as morning, as fresh as dew, and already called one of the jazz greats. He is not only a seer and an exemplary musician, but a poet as well. He informs us that jazz was created, among other things, to expose the hypocrisy and absurdity of racism and other ignorances in our country. Poetry was given to human beings for the same reason. This book could be called ""How Love Can Change Your Life,"" for there could be no jazz without love. By love, of course, I do not mean mush, or sentimentality. Love can only exist with courage, and this book could not be written without Wynton Marsalis's courage. He has the courage to make powerful music and to love the music so, that he willingly shares its riches with the entire human family. We are indebted to him."" --Maya AngelouFrom the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From well-known names like Nick Cave and Mission of Burma to lesser-known greats like Bill MacKay and Condo Fucks, Samarov draws haunting portraits of artistry at the fringes of (and off the edges of) the mainstream, while also offering poignant and memorable essays not only about their work, but about musicianship and art, creativity and commerce—the perils of selling out, and the dangers of never doing so, and above all else, the thrill of creating something new. A love song and a lifer’s lament, Music to My Eyes is an exquisite tribute to the trials and triumphs of independent music.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

The crucial question is where to draw the line between what can be expressed verbally and what cannot when it comes to communicating about quality in this context. The point of departure for the author’s exploration is the noticeable tension that exists between different participants in The Cultural Rucksack (DKS) initiative and the school concert arena. Other researchers have explored this issue, but their contributions do not converge regarding the level of tension and the content of the different stances (cf. Borgen & Brandt 2006; Breivik & Christophersen 2014; Holdhus 2014). When Music Makes Sense aims particularly at clarifying the latter question, i.e., illuminating the specific content of the different stances. The lines of conflict and accord are made more apparent and palpable, and previous research is partly amended. This applies notably to the pupils own opinions on quality, as the treatise shows that they have more divergent opinions than what had been noted in previous research on DKS.

Based on a selection of lyric poems by Federico García Lorca, Love, Crystal and Stone explores the core question, “How can the lyric poetry of Lorca be re-experienced by critically rethinking the poetic potentials of the formal construction of the music?” In my dissertation, I will discuss the various ways that my music, in its formal construction, attempts to incorporate Lorca’s text in order to capture and reiterate the essence of the text. In my essay, I will also explore the choices of material and my compositional processes, including a description of how I continuously rework and re-contextualize my musical material not only throughout the span of the piece, but through the arc of my catalogue of works. The theoretical analysis of the piece involves an in-depth explanation of the musical elements of Love, Crystal and Stone including form; pitch, timbral, and rhythmic structures; the incorporation of musical gestures; and orchestration choices.  Finally, I will conclude with a brief discussion of my approach to the analysis of Love, Crystal and Stone.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Check the Technique,Brian Coleman,music,First published in 2007,/works/OL6731435W,/authors/OL1823225A/Brian_Coleman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8021223M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 12, 2007|Publisher  Villard|Language English|Pages 528","A Tribe Called Quest - Beastie Boys - De La Soul - Eric B. & Rakim - The Fugees - KRS-One - Pete Rock & CL Smooth - Public Enemy - The Roots - Run-DMC - Wu-Tang Clan - and twenty-five more hip-hop immortalsIt's a sad fact: hip-hop album liners have always been reduced to a list of producer and sample credits, a publicity photo or two, and some hastily composed shout-outs. That's a damn shame, because few outside the game know about the true creative forces behind influential masterpieces like PE's It Takes a Nation of Millions. . ., De La's 3 Feet High and Rising, and Wu-Tang's Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). A longtime scribe for the hip-hop nation, Brian Coleman fills this void, and delivers a thrilling, knockout oral history of the albums that define this dynamic and iconoclastic art form. The format: One chapter, one artist, one album, blow-by-blow and track-by-track, delivered straight from the original sources. Performers, producers, DJs, and b-boys--including Big Daddy Kane, Muggs and B-Real, Biz Markie, RZA, Ice-T, and Wyclef--step to the mic to talk about the influences, environment, equipment, samples, beats, beefs, and surprises that went into making each classic record. Studio craft and street smarts, sonic inspiration and skate ramps, triumph, tragedy, and take-out food--all played their part in creating these essential albums of the hip-hop canon.Insightful, raucous, and addictive, Check the Technique transports you back to hip-hop's golden age with the greatest artists of the '80s and '90s. This is the book that belongs on the stacks next to your wax.""Brian Coleman's writing is a lot like the albums he covers: direct, uproarious, and more than six-fifths genius.""     --Jeff Chang, author of Can't Stop Won't Stop ""All producers and hip-hop fans must read this book. It really shows how these albums were made and touches the music fiend in everyone."" --DJ Evil Dee of Black Moon and Da Beatminerz ""A rarity in mainstream publishing: a truly essential rap history."" --Ronin Ro, author of Have Gun Will Travel From the Trade Paperback edition.

Schirmer, Inc.|Language English|Pages 108","Rachmaninoff greatly admired Chopin. He wrote 24 preludes, sentimentally because Chopin had written 24, but for a logical reason as well. He wanted, in 24 verses, to show the piano from every possible angle. Like those of Chopin, each of Rachmaninoff's preludes is built on a different key, but they should be played in the order of their publication. They were conceived this way emotionally. The celebrated Prelude in C-Sharp Minor was written 11 years before Op. 23, when the composer was 19. The Op. 23 preludes were composed two years after Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, while the 13 preludes of Op. 32 were written one year after the Third Concerto. There is a decided difference in texture between the compositions of the two major periods. ""You can hear this transition,"" remarked Weissenberg. ""Rachmaninoff's writing became more complex, more contrapuntal; harmonically more interesting and more exciting. I do not think, however, that the melodic inspiration developed further from the earlier set [1903] to the later [1910] because Rachmaninoff was melodically gifted from the very beginning."" - Program notes.

Tra sensi e spirito,Di Manno Marco,music,First published in 2009,/works/OL20933869W,/authors/OL8013115A/Di_Manno_Marco,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Firenze University Press,"Tra sensi e spirito investigates the origins of a sort of 'Copernican revolution' that took place in western culture when music acquired an undisputed primacy over the other arts, becoming the privileged medium of metaphysical knowledge, if not actually the very emblem of absolute Truth. Starting from the analysis of the principal oppositions (between melody and harmony, word and sound, voice and instruments) emerging from the aesthetic debate that developed in the latter half of the eighteenth century, first in France and later in Germany, Tra sensi e spirito brings to light the essential ambivalence of music, in which we can discern a dual nature: sensual-erotic and mystical-spiritual. Examining these two aspects, supremely exemplified in the works of Wilhelm Heinse and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and the characters created by them, the book brings out the figure of the 'problematic' artist in a modern sense, who experiences with profound unease the ambiguity of the ""criminal innocence"" of the musical phenomenon: a musical phenomenon that acts at once as a redeeming and a 'narcotic' force, engendering a loss of contact with reality.  Tra sensi e spirito indaga le origini di una sorta di 'rivoluzione copernicana' vissuta nella cultura occidentale quando la musica conquista un primato indiscusso sulle altre arti, divenendo il medium privilegiato della conoscenza metafisica, se non addirittura l'emblema stesso della Verità assoluta. A partire dall'analisi delle principali opposizioni (tra melodia e armonia, parola e suono, voce e strumenti) che emergono dal dibattito estetico sviluppatosi nel secondo '700 prima in Francia e poi in Germania, Tra sensi e spirito mette in luce l'ambivalenza di fondo della musica, nella quale si riscontra una doppia natura: sensuale-erotica e mistico-spirituale. Esaminando questi due aspetti, che trovano una rappresentazione esemplare nelle opere di Heinse e Wackenroder e nei personaggi da loro creati, il volume fa emergere la figura dell''artista problematico' in senso moderno, che vive con profondo disagio l'ambiguità, la «delittuosa innocenza» del fenomeno musicale; un fenomeno musicale che agisce contemporaneamente come forza redentrice e 'narcotico', facendo perdere contatto con la realtà.

Divided into two sections, this volume explores research on J.S. Bach and more broadly examines the topics of music and performance studies; with the latter focusing on composers active today, such as Marco Alunno, or those from the recent past who are lesser-known and performed, such as Pietro Cimara and Leo Ornstein. Following from Nones's (ed.) previous publication Music as Communication: Perspectives on Music, Image and Performance (ABEPaperback, 2018), this work provides a rather unique contribution as a choral attempt at exploring performance today. The intention of this book and the downloadable audio content, with live recordings of the music explored at the conference from which the volume originated, is to inspire fresh approaches to the study of a monument like Bach, while also encouraging original research of modern composition and performance. Recordings of the performances given over the two days of the conference serve either to clarify arguments made in the papers or to attest to the music explored more generally. This volume is founded on the belief that the history of music is comprised of many figures, some of whom are undeservedly forgotten, and that our understanding of and approach to music is simultaneously shaped by the past and directed by the continual evolution of sounds and attitudes of the present. Examining music styles from baroque (Bach) to contemporary (Alunno), Forms of Performance will be of particular interest to Bach and performance studies scholars, as well as advanced researchers and PhD students in this field""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By encoding music with addictive and mind-altering elements, the Corp holds control over all citizens, particularly conduits like Anthem, whose life energy feeds the main power in the Grid. Anthem finds hope and comfort in the twin siblings he cares for, even as he watches the life drain slowly and painfully from his father. Escape is found in his underground rock band, where music sounds free, clear, and unencoded deep in an abandoned basement. But when a band member dies suspiciously from a tracking overdose, Anthem knows that his time has suddenly become limited. Revolution all but sings in the air, and Anthem cannot help but answer the call with the chords of choice and free will. But will the girl he loves help or hinder him?""--YA Book Exchange.

The story revolves around a Midwestern man who has written a successful book. It is optioned by Broadway producers and they contact him to come to New York to talk about adapting the book into a musical.  The semi-autobiographical novel was turned into a Broadway play in 1958. It contained (from Wikipedia) ""nine original songs with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne, all of the songs were presented as either rehearsal or audition material and not as the thoughts or feelings of the characters."" so that some conclude that Say, Darling was, indeed, a Broadway musical.  The first people listed are fictional characters from the novel. George Abbott and Harold Prince are 2 people Richard Bissell worked with on Pajama Game and he based 2 characters in the novel on them. The other names are actors who played characters in the Broadway production.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The rest is history. However, for Decca, the only other major record company of the time, this event triggered a frenetic search for talent wich persisted throughout the 1960s. At the time, David Wedgbury was the first staff photographer to be employed by Decca and his brief was to capture all this raw talent on film for the equally new and exciting world of pop promotion. This book collects together 100 of the best of these photographs, including the Rolling Stones, the Who, David Bowie and Marianne Faithfull. The photographs by David Wedgbury are annotated with anecdotes and personal reminiscences written by John Tracy.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book provides an accessible introduction to the Sonatas Opp. 27 and 31 (including The 'Moonlight' and 'The Tempest'), aimed at pianists, students, and music lovers. It begins with the works' historical background - the emergence of a 'piano culture' at the end of the eighteenth century, Beethoven's aristocratic milieu in Vienna, and his oft-quoted intention to follow a new compositional path. An account of the sonatas' genesis is followed by a discussion of their reception history, including a survey of changing performing styles since the mid-nineteenth century. The concept of the Sonata quasi una Fantasia is examined in relation to the cult of artistic sensibility in early-nineteenth-century Vienna. And the study concludes with a critical introduction to each sonata.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Modernism and opera,Richard Begam,music,First published in 2016,/works/OL20053257W,/authors/OL536346A/Richard_Begam,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 378,"""At first glance, modernism and opera may seem like strange bedfellows--the former hostile to sentiment, the latter wearing its heart on its sleeve. And yet these apparent opposites attract: many operas are aesthetically avant-garde, politically subversive, and socially transgressive. From the proto-modernist strains of Richard Wagner's Parsifal through the twenty-first-century modernism of Kaija Saariaho's L'amour de loin, the duet between modernism and opera, at turns harmonious and dissonant, has been one of the central artistic events of modernity. Despite this centrality, scholars of modernist literature only rarely venture into opera, and music scholars generally return the favor by leaving literature to one side. But opera, that grand cauldron of the arts, demands that scholars, too, share the stage with one another. In Modernism and Opera, Richard Begam and Matthew Wilson Smith bring together musicologists, literary critics, and theater scholars for the first time in a mutual endeavor to trace certain key moments in the history of modernism and opera.""--Book jacket.

Slash,Slash (Musician),music,First published in 2007,/works/OL13676717W,/authors/OL6532048A/Slash_(Musician),//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24277143M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Harper Entertainment|Language English|Pages 457,"From one of the greatest rock guitarists of our era comes a memoir that redefines sex, drugs, and rock 'n' rollHe was born in England but reared in L.A., surrounded by the leading artists of the day amidst the vibrant hotbed of music and culture that was the early seventies. Slash spent his adolescence on the streets of Hollywood, discovering drugs, drinking, rock music, and girls, all while achieving notable status as a BMX rider. But everything changed in his world the day he first held the beat-up one-string guitar his grandmother had discarded in a closet.The instrument became his voice and it triggered a lifelong passion that made everything else irrelevant. As soon as he could string chords and a solo together, Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend, Steven Adler, proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts, Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Steven Adler, and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty, volatile, and as authentic as the streets that weaned them, they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconic Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion I and II.Here, for the first time ever, Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together, how they wrote the music that defined an era, how they survived insane, never-ending tours, how they survived themselves, and, ultimately, how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines, always on the edge of self-destruction, even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present, from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top, Slash battled his demons, escaping the overwhelming reality with women, heroin, coke, crack, vodka, and whatever else came along.He survived it all: lawsuits, rehab, riots, notoriety, debauchery, and destruction, and ultimately found his creative evolution. From Slash's Snakepit to his current band, the massively successful Velvet Revolver,Slash found an even keel by sticking to his guns. Slash is everything the man, the myth, the legend, inspires: it's funny, honest, inspiring, jaw-dropping . . . and, in a word, excessive.

En la débarrassant de ses habits d'exotisme, Patrick Moutal a été l'un des premiers auteurs de langue française à rédiger en 1987 un ouvrage de vulgarisation, à la fois éclairé et simple d'accès. Introuvable depuis une quinzaine d’années, le « petit livre rouge » reparaît aujourd'hui, dans une nouvelle édition revue et augmentée. Le nouveau texte comporte des ajouts majeurs.     Ce bréviaire de la musique classique de l'Inde du Nord offre des clefs pour la compréhension du raga : éléments constitutifs, élaboration, développement dans les différents genres et styles d'interprétation, cycles rythmiques. Il propose également des outils pratiques pour la fabrication de thèmes et de métriques. Un véritable « comment ça marche » de la musique hindoustanie !    Considérablement enrichi, il s'adresse aussi bien au musicien praticien qu'au mélomane.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As Elena Mannes reveals in her eye-opening book, we are at a breakthrough moment in music research, for only recently has science sought in earnest to understand and explain the power of music and its connection to the body, the brain, and the world of nature. The award-winning creator of the acclaimed documentary The Music Instinct: Science & Song follows visionary researchers and accomplished musicians to unveil the latest discoveries in the new science of music. How much of our musicality is learned and how much is innate? Can examining the biological foundations of music help scientists unravel the intricate web of human cognition and brain function? Why is music virtually universal across cultures and time, and does it provide some evolutionary advantage? Can music make people healthier? Might music contain organizing principles of harmonic vibration that underlie the cosmos itself? One remarkable recent study shows that infants' cries contain common musical intervals. Physics experiments show that sound waves can change the structure of a material; world-famous musician Bobby McFerrin believes musical sound vibrations physically penetrate our bodies, shifting molecules as they do. From neurologist Gottfried Schlaug and X-ray astronomer Andrew Fabian, who studies the actual music of the spheres, to opera star Deborah Voigt and the deaf Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie, who ""hears"" through her feet, Mannes takes us to the crossroads of science and culture. Perhaps most remarkably, she explores the power of music to heal. ""We can imagine a day,"" she writes, ""when doctors write prescriptions for music,"" knowing what precise combinations of notes and styles affect different parts of the body and mind. - Publisher.

From there, he guides the reader through an exploration of polyphony—the simultaneous sounding of multiple independent melodies—and an increasingly rich array of different sonorites that grow out of this practice. The book culminates with a discussion of musical form, engaging with artistic works in their entirety by considering the interaction of harmonic and thematic elements, but also such other musical dimensions as rhythm, meter, texture, and expression.Along the way, Mount supplements the text with over eight hundred musical examples which, in the online version of the text, include embedded audio files for immediate aural reinforcement of theoretical concepts. Most of these examples are drawn from the literature, including nearly 200 excerpts by women and other underrepresented groups. The reader is also given the opportunity to check their understanding of the text with interactive exercises at every step of the way. Fundamentals, Function, and Form was written with the undergraduate music student in mind, but self-guided readers would also be rewarded with a deep understanding of this musical tradition. <a href=""https://milneopentextbooks.org/fundamentals-function-and-form/"">Return to milneopentextbooks.org to download PDF and other versions of this text</a><p>This text provides readers with a comprehensive study of the theory and analysis of tonal Western art music.

Bell and Sons, Ltd.|Language English|Pages 163","From the inside front dustcover flap of the original hardcover edition:  ""As the title implies, this is not primarily a book on the orchestra, but rather on the orchestration of music originally written for some other medium, normally the piano. Its aim is to help the student to think in terms of orchestral idiom and to understand how passages conceived from a purely pianistic point of view must be dealt with in order to make them orchestrally effective.  ""The various departments of the orchestra are dealt with progressively and in detail, with continual insistence on the fact that 'orchestration' is not just a matter of more or less literal transcription from two staves to, say, twenty, but that it involves consideration of the musical content of the piece concerned and the implications which arise from it.  ""The instructional text is highly concentrated. There are 131 musical examples, ranging from a single stave up to full score, the latter being extensively annotated. Most of the examples are taken from Schumann's 'Album for the Young'. Chapters are included on the handling of examination questions, reduction from full orchestra to small orchestra, and on scoring for school orchestras.  ""Clear instruction is also given on laying out a score, a matter in which many young musicians are apt to be careless.  ""Although written largely with the examination candidate in mind, this book cannot fail to be of the utmost use to all who are concerned with writing or arranging for orchestra.""

While Sendrey's approach is thoroughly secular, his scholarship is comparative rather than ideological, and executed with intellectual integrity.  Hence, it remains an outstanding resource for clergy and musicians of diverse faiths who are responsible for worship leadership.  Music in Ancient Israel is essentially a work of ethnomusicology, and while Sendrey avoids the overuse of esoteric language, readers lacking formal music education may want to keep a music dictionary handy, (or bookmark one on line).

Whence the weirdness and alleged criminality? How to account for Michael Jackson's rise and fall? In On Michael Jackson--an at once passionate, incisive, and bracing work of cultural analysis--Pulitzer Prize--winning critic for The New York Times Margo Jefferson brilliantly unravels the complexities of one of the most enigmatic figures of our time.Who is Michael Jackson and what does it mean to call him a ""What Is It""? What do P. T. Barnum, Peter Pan, and Edgar Allan Poe have to do with our fascination with Jackson? How did his curious Victorian upbringing and his tenure as a child prodigy on the ""chitlin' circuit"" inform his character and multiplicity of selves? How is Michael Jackson's celebrity related to the outrageous popularity of nineteenth-century minstrelsy? What is the perverse appeal of child stars for grown-ups and what is the price of such stardom for these children and for us? What uncanniness provoked Michael Jackson to become ""Alone of All His Race, Alone of All Her Sex,"" while establishing himself as an undeniably great performer with neo-Gothic, dandy proclivities and a producer of visionary music videos? What do we find so unnerving about Michael Jackson's presumed monstrosity? In short, how are we all of us implicated?In her stunning first book, Margo Jefferson gives us the incontrovertible lowdown on call-him-what-you-wish; she offers a powerful reckoning with a quintessential, richly allusive signifier of American society and popular culture.From the Hardcover edition.

The band aimed to build on previous sales and critical acclaim with its boldest and most ambitious album yet, but was instead urged by skittish Reprise execs to make the record more ""radio friendly."" When Wilco wouldn't give, they found themselves without a label.  Instead, they used the Internet to introduce the album to their fans, and eventually sold the record to Nonesuch, another division of Warner.  Wilco was vindicated when the album debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard charts and posted the band's strongest sales to date. Wilco: Learning How to Die traces the band's story to its deepest origins in Southern Illinois, where Jeff Tweedy began growing into one of the best songwriters of his generation. As we witness how his music grew from its punk and alt-country origins, some of the key issues and questions in our culture are addressed: How is music of substance created while the gulf between art and commerce widens in the corporate consolidation era? How does the music industry make or break a hit? How do working musicians reconcile the rewards of artistic risk with the toll it exacts on their personal life? This book was written with the cooperation of Wilco band members past and present.  It is also fully up to date, covering the latest changes in personnel and the imminent release of the band's fifth album, A Ghost Is Born, sure to be one of the most talked-about albums of 2004.

By the turn of the twentieth century and the beginning of this new milennium the subject of culture had presented itself to theologians and church leaders for vital consideration. As one of the world's leading theologians, Robert Jenson's eminent career has coincided with the pre-eminence of culture in theological and churchly discussion. Having described himself as a theologian of culture in his earliest works, culture continually informs Jenson's systematic theology, which in turn works its way out in countless cultural forms. In Rhyming Hope and History we explore the philiosophical and theological influences of Jenson's work and outline their vast and varied applications to the world of culture and the life of the church. For Jenson, the church is the cultural embodiment of the risen Christ in the fallen reality of our world. In a series of conversations between Jenson and leading thinkers, including G.W.F. Hegel, Jonathan Edwards, Wittgenstein, Richard H. Niebuhr, Kathryn Tanner, Paul Tillich, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Augustine, and Jeremy Begbie, we explore this creative and courageous proposal.

Taking his cue from the German philosopher's remarks about the bourgeois concert audience, the emergence of criticism and the development of autonomous music, Chanan examines the fate of the composer through successive incarnations, from Handel, Bach and Mozart in the eighteenth century, by way of Beethoven, Liszt, Wagner, Mahler and Debussy in the nineteenth, to Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartók, Gershwin, Weill, Ellington, Cage and Boulez in the twentieth. Drawing upon recent work in feminist and gay musicology, the book ranges over themes such as subjectivity and identity in Schubert and Chopin, the ascendancy of the Romantic personality, the lure of the exotic in Milhaud's work, and the political economy of music. A detailed history of the idea of the composer as a public figure, Chanan's book charts both the dramatic change in the listening audience and, simultaneously, the composer's progressive marginalization from the center of musical life. - Jacket flap.

Jeremy Wallach explores this question as it plays out in the eclectic, evolving world of Indonesian music after the fall of the repressive Soeharto regime. Against the backdrop of Indonesia’s fitful, chaotic transition to democracy, Wallach takes us to recording studios, music stores, concert venues, university campuses, video shoots, and urban neighborhoods. Integrating detailed, ground-level ethnographic research with insights drawn from contemporary cultural theory, he shows that Indonesia’s access to globally circulating music and technologies has neither extinguished nor homogenized local music-making in Indonesia. Instead, it has provided young Indonesians with creative possibilities for exploring their identity in a culturally diverse nation undergoing dramatic changes in an increasingly interconnected world.

In this wide-ranging study of musical irony, Michael Cherlin draws upon the rich history of the trope as developed by rhetoricians, philosophers, literary scholars, poets, and novelists. With occastional reflections on film music and other contemporary works, the principal focus of the book is classical music, instrumental and vocal, ranging from Mozart to Mahler. The result is a surprising array of approaches toward the making and interpretation of irony in music. Including nearly ninety musical examples, the book is clearly structured and engagingly written. This interdisciplinary volume will appeal to those interested in the relationship between music and literature as well as to scholars of musical compositions, technique, and style."" -- from back cover.

Imagine a pied piper singing in a dazzling falsetto, wearing glittering sequins, and leading the young people of the nation to San Francisco and on to liberation where nothing was straight-laced or old-fashioned. And everyone, finally, was welcome-to come as themselves.  This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco sensation Sylvester was the piper. Joshua Gamson-a Yale-trained pop culture expert-uses him, a boy who would be fabulous, to lead us through the story of the '70s when a new era of change liberated us from conformity and boredom. Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation's wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music.  The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.

In this tough neighborhood, Nelson was the nerdy kid who, in between stickball and street games, devoured Captain America comics, Ernest Hemingway novels, and album liner notes.City Kid introduces us to Nelson’s family: his absent wanna-be-hustler father; his tough-minded sister, who is seduced by the streets; and his mother, who dreams of becoming a teacher and returning to the South. Amid the struggles of his family, Nelson finds himself drawn into the world of black pop culture, first as a writer and then as a filmmaker, eventually collaborating with some of the major figures of the era—Spike Lee, Russell Simmons, Chris Rock, and many others.Nelson’s story is ultimately one of triumph, but it is not saccharine, sentimental, or full of false inspiration. Seeking transcendence through art and loving New York City, Nelson creates an insightful portrait of the emergence of black artists in the 1980s and 90s and illuminates how the pain of life can be turned into thoughtful books and cinema.

Or that Patti LaBelle didn't know what 'Voulez-vous couches avec moi ce soir?' actually meant? These and countless other fascinating back stories of some of our best-known and best-loved songs fill this book, a collection of the highly successful weekly The Life of a Song columns that appear in the FT Weekend every Saturday. Each 600-word piece gives a mini-biography of a single song, from its earliest form (often a spiritual, or a jazz number), through the various covers and changes, often morphing from one genre to another, always focusing on the 'biography' of the song itself while including the many famous artists who have performed or recorded it. The selection covers a wide spectrum of the songs we all know and love--rock, pop, folk, jazz and more. Each piece is pithy, sparkily written, knowledgeable, entertaining, full of anecdotes and surprises. They combine deep musical knowledge with the vivid background of the performers and musicians, and of course the often intriguing social and political background against which the songs were created.

Stuart Cosgrove has been a well-known collector on the scene for decades, and here he takes the reader on a rollercoaster journey to the heart of this secret society: the iconic clubs - The Twisted Wheel, The Torch, Wigan Casino and the Blackpool Mecca, the infamous bootleggers, and the DJs and crate-digging collectors who voyaged to America to unearth rare sounds. The book sweeps across fifty years of social and cultural history, taking in the rise of the amphetamine culture, the brutal policing of the youth scene, the north-south divide, the rise of Thatcherism and the miners' strike, and concludes with a picture of northern soul today: as popular now as it was in its 1970s heyday.""--Page [4] of cover.

It can conjure up bad memories of grade school music classes, rattle the brains of college students, and make self-taught musicians feel self-defeated. Music Theory may seem tedious and unnecessary, especially since not many people can read music.   Luckily, Music Theory for Dummies shows you the fun and easy way to understanding the concepts needed to compose, deconstruct, and comprehend music. This helpful guide will give you a great grasp of:    Note value and counting notes  Treble and bass clefs  Time signatures and measures  Naturalizing the rhythm  Tempo and dynamic  Tone, color, and harmonics  Half steps and whole steps  Harmonic and melodic intervals  Key signatures and circles of fifths  Scales, chords, and their progressions  Elements of form  Music theory's fascinating history     This friendly guide not only explores these concepts, it provides examples of music to compliment them so you can hear how they sound firsthand. With a bonus CD that demonstrates these ideas with musical excerpts on guitar and piano, this hands-on resource will prove to you that music theory is as enjoyable as it is useful. Don't get discouraged by the seemingly complicated written structure. With Music Theory for Dummies, understanding music has never been easier!

Its dazzling virtuosity and spectacular live concerts made it hugely popular with fans during the 1970s, who saw bands such as King Crimson, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, and JethroTull bring a new level of depth and sophistication to rock. On the other hand, critics branded the elaborate concerts of these bands as self- indulgent and materialistic. They viewed progressive rock's classical/rock fusion attempts as elitist, a betrayal of rock's populist origins...   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Damascus Kafumbe argues that the ensemble sustains a complex sociopolitical hierarchy, interweaving and maintaining a delicate balance between kin and clan ties and royal prerogatives through musical performance and storytelling that integrates human and nonhuman stories. He describes this phenomenon as 'tuning the kingdom,' and he compares it to the process of tensioning or stretching Kiganda drums, which are always moving in and out of tune. Even as Kawuugulu continues to adapt to the rapidly changing world around it, Tuning the Kingdom documents how Kawuugulu has historically articulated and embodied principles of the three inextricably related domains that serve as the backbone of Kiganda politics: kinship, clanship, and kingship""--Publisher's description.

Sam loves Ramona, but he would never expect her to feel the same way-she's too quirky and cool for someone like him. Still, they complement each other perfectly, both as best friends and as a band. Tom makes music too, and he's the band's missing piece. The three quickly become inseparable. Except Ramona's falling in love with Tom. But she hasn't fallen out of love with Sam either.

Knopf,              Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|Language English","Johann Sebastian Bach is one of the most unfathomable composers in the history of music. How can such sublime work have been produced by a man who (when we can discern his personality at all) seems so ordinary, so opaque, and occasionally so intemperate? John Eliot Gardiner grew up passing one of the only two authentic portraits of Bach every morning and evening on the stairs of his parents' house, where it hung for safety during World War II. He has been studying and performing Bach ever since, and is now regarded as one of the composer's greatest living interpreters. The fruits of this lifetime's immersion are distilled in this remarkable book, grounded in the most recent Bach scholarship but moving far beyond it, and explaining in wonderful detail the ideas on which Bach drew, how he worked, how his music is constructed, how it achieves its effects, and what it can tell us about Bach the man. Gardiner's background as a historian has encouraged him to search for ways in which scholarship and performance can cooperate and fruitfully coalesce. This has entailed piecing together the few biographical shards, scrutinizing the music, and watching for those instances when Bach's personality seems to penetrate the fabric of his notation. Gardiner's aim is ""to give the reader a sense of inhabiting the same experiences and sensations that Bach might have had in the act of music-making. This, I try to show, can help us arrive at a more human likeness discernible in the closely related processes of composing and performing his music."" It is very rare that such an accomplished performer of music should also be a considerable writer and thinker about it. John Eliot Gardiner takes us as deeply into Bach's works and mind as perhaps words can. The result is a unique book about one of the greatest of all creative artists. - Publisher.

This biography tells the story of how they made that dream come true - and how it then turned into a nightmare for all of them. How at the height of their fame, Sabbath discovered they had been so badly ripped off by their managers they did not even own their own songs. How they looked for salvation from Don Arden - an even more notorious gangster figure, who resurrected their career but still left them indebted to him, financially and personally. And how it finally came to a head when in 1979 they sacked Ozzy: 'For being too out of control - even for us, ' as Bill Ward put it. Of course the story does not end there. The next 15 years would see a war break out between the two camps: the post-Ozzy Sabbath and Ozzy himself, whose solo career overshadowed Sabbath to the point where, when he offered them the chance to reform around him again, it was entirely on his terms. Or rather, that of his wife and manager - and, to add a further bitter twist to the tale for Sabbath, daughter of Don Arden - Sharon Osbourne.  The final word on the only name synonymous with subversive heavy metal - Black Sabbath.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Text and Act collects for the first time the most important of Taruskin's essays and reviews from this period, many of which now classics in the field.  Taking awide-ranging cultural view of the phenomenon, he shows that the movement, far from reviving ancient traditions, in fact represents the only truly modern style of performance being offered today.  He goes on to contend that the movement is therefore far more valuable and even authentic than thehistorical verisimilitude for which it ostensibly strives could ever be.  These essays cast fresh light on many aspects of contemporary music-making and music-thinking, mixing lighthearted debunking with impassioned argumentation...

While shallow celebrities dominate the headlines, pundits bemoan the death of the music industry, and the government decries teenagers for their morals (or lack thereof) earnest, heartfelt bands like Dashboard Confessional, Jimmy Eat World, and Thursday are quietly selling hundreds of thousands of albums through dedication, relentless touring and respect for their fans. This relationship - between young people and the empathetic music that sets them off down a road of self-discovery and self-definition - is emo, a much-maligned, mocked, and misunderstood term that has existed for nearly two decades, but has flourished only recently. In Nothing Feels Good, Andy Greenwald makes the case for emo as more than a genre - it's an essential rite of teenagehood. From the '80s to the '00s, from the basement to the stadium, from tour buses to chat rooms, and from the diary to the computer screen, Nothing Feels Good narrates the story of emo from the inside out and explores the way this movement is taking shape in real time and with real hearts on the line. Nothing Feels Good is the first book to explore this exciting moment in music history and Greenwald has been given unprecedented access to the bands and to their fans. He captures a place in time and a moment on the stage in a way only a true music fan can   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We Are The Clash is a gripping tale of the band's struggle to reinvent itself as George Orwell's 1984 loomed. This bold campaign crashed headlong into a wall of internal contradictions and rising right-wing power. While the world teetered on edge of the nuclear abyss, British miners waged a life-or-death strike, and tens of thousands died from US guns in Central America, Clash cofounders Joe Strummer, Paul Simonon, and Bernard Rhodes waged a desperate last stand after ejecting guitarist Mick Jones and drummer Topper Headon. The band shattered just as its controversial final album, Cut the Crap, was emerging. Andersen and Heibutzki weave together extensive archival research and in-depth original interviews with virtually all of the key players involved to tell a moving story of idealism undone by human frailty amid a climatic turning point for our world."" -- Publisher's description.

In 2009, many Koreans reacted with dismay when China officially recognized the folksong 'Arirang', commonly regarded as the national folksong in North and South Korea, as part of its national intangible cultural heritage. They were vindicated when versions from both sides of the DMZ were included in UNESCO?s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity a few years later. At least on a national level, folksongs thus carry significant political importance. Maliangkay describes how an elaborate system of heritage management was first established in modern Korea and raises an important issue of cultural preservation?traditions that fail to attract practitioners and audiences are unsustainable, so compromises may be unwelcome but imperative.

With this, the first in a dazzling new quartet of novels, Balogh invites us into a special world--a select academy for young ladies--a world of innocence and temptation. Drawing us into the lives of four women, teachers at Miss Martin's School for Girls, Balogh introduces this novel's marvelous heroine: music teacher Frances Allard--and the man who seduces her with a passion no woman could possibly forget....They meet in a ferocious snowstorm. She is a young teacher with a secret past. He is the cool, black-caped stranger who unexpectedly comes to her rescue. Between these two unlikely strangers, desire is instantaneous...and utterly impossible to resist. Stranded together in a rustic country inn, Lucius Marshall, who is the Viscount Sinclair, and Frances Allard share a night of glorious, unforgettable passion. But Frances knows her place--and it is far from the privileged world of the sensual aristocrat. Due to begin her teaching position at Miss Martin's School in Bath, Frances must try to forget that one extraordinary night--and the man who touched her with such exquisite tenderness and abandon.But Frances cannot hide forever.  And when fate once again throws them together, Lucius refuses to take no for an answer.  If Frances will not be his wife, he will make her his mistress. So begins an odyssey fraught with intrigue, one that defies propriety and shocks the straitlaced ton. For Lucius's passionate, single-minded pursuit is about to force Frances to give up all her secrets--except one--to win the heart of the man she already loves.Once again this incomparable storyteller captures a time and a place like no other.  And in Lucius and Frances, Mary Balogh gives us her most unlikely lovers yet--a nobleman in search of the perfect wife and an unconventional woman willing to risk everything for an unforgettable love.From the Hardcover edition.

Bach was an important composer in his own right, as well as a writer and performer on keyboard instruments. He composed roughly a thousand works in all the leading genres of the period, with the exception of opera, and Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all acknowledged his influence. He was also the author of a two-volume encyclopedic book about performance on keyboard instrument. C.P.E. Bach and his music have always been the subject of significant scholarship and publication but interest has sharply increased over the past two or three decades from performers as well as music historians. This volume incorporates important writings not only on the composer and his chief works but also on theoretical issues and performance questions. The focus throughout is on relatively recent scholarship otherwise available only in hard-to-access sources. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But from the first time GK (as he was nicknamed by Elvis) heard this kid sing, he knew that Elvis Presley was someone extraordinary. During Elvis's rise to fame and throughout the wild swirl of his remarkable life, Klein was a steady presence and one of Elvis's closest and most loyal friends until his untimely death in 1977. In Elvis: My Best Man, a heartfelt, entertaining, and long-awaited contribution to our understanding of Elvis Presley and the early days of rock 'n' roll, George Klein writes with great affection for the friend he knew--about who the King of Rock 'n' Roll really was and how he acted when the stage lights were off. This fascinating chronicle of boundary-breaking and music-making through one of the most intriguing and dynamic stretches of American history overflows with insights and anecdotes from someone who was in the middle of it all. From the good times at Graceland to hanging out with Hollywood stars to butting heads with Elvis's iron-handed manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to making sure that Elvis's legacy is fittingly honored, GK was a true friend of the King and a trailblazer in the music industry in his own right.From the Hardcover edition.

It follows the broad outline of its predecessors, but has been completely recast for the benefit of today's training in recording and its allied arts and sciences. Digital recording and signal processing are covered in detail, as are actual studio miking and production techniques -- including the developing field of surround sound. As always, the traditional topics of basic stereo, studio acoustics, analog tape recording, and the stereo LP are covered in greater detail than you are likely to find anywhere except in archival references. This book has been completely updated with numerous new topics added and outdated material removed. Many technical descriptions are now presented in Sidebars, leaving the primary text for more general descriptions. Handbook of Recording Engineering, Fourth Edition is for students preparing for careers in audio, recording, broadcast, and motion picture sound work. It will also be useful as a handbook for professionals already in the audio workplace. _ John Eargle has consulted extensively in electroacoustical product development, primarily with JBL Incorporated and other companies in the Harman International group. He also founded his own company, now called JME Consulting Corporation. He has published numerous technical articles, and his books, Handbook of Recording Engineering, The Microphone Handbook, Handbook of Sound System Design, Electroacoustical Reference Data, Music, Sound, and Technology, and The Loudspeaker Handbook, are considered classics in the field. He currently holds the position of Senior Director of Product Development and Application for JBL Professional.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""Music is the reward for being alive,"" writes Jorma Kaukonen in this candid and emotional account of his life and work. ""It stirs memory in a singular way that is unmatched."" In a career that has already spanned a half century--one that has earned him induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, among other honors--Jorma is best known for his legendary bands Jefferson Airplane and the still-touring Hot Tuna. But before he won worldwide recognition he was just a young man with a passion and a dream. Been So Long is the story of how Jorma found his place in the world of music and beyond. The grandson of Finnish and Russian-Jewish immigrants whose formative years were spent abroad with his American-born diplomat father, Jorma channeled his life experiences--from his coming-of-age in Pakistan and the Phillipines to his early gigs with Jack Casady in D.C. to his jam sessions in San Francisco with Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Bob Dylan, and other contemporaries--into his art in unique and revelatory ways. Been So Long charts not only Jorma's association with the bands that made him famous but goes into never-before-told details about his addiction and recovery, his troubled first marriage and still-thriving second, and more. Interspersed with diary entries, personal correspondence, and song lyrics, this memoir is as unforgettable and inspiring as Jorma's music itself.""--Dust jacket.

Sonata for Violin and Piano,John Corigliano,music,First published in 1986,/works/OL8237048W,/authors/OL2741431A/John_Corigliano,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11198596M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2015|Publisher  G. Schirmer, Inc.","Sonata form provides the structural basis for the first movement, marked Allegro. In C major, the first theme features large leaps, while the secondary theme is built on jazzy rhythms within a 5/8 meter. The second movement also has two themes, but each of these forms a primary section and the second features a particularly diabolical sounding diminished fifth. There is no development, and the two sections of the movement act as contrasting entities within an overall key of D major. Marked Recitative, the third movement provides a break from the intensely lyrical music heard thus far and moves the harmonic foundation to G major. Back in D major, the fourth movement takes rondo form as its point of departure. As in the later Piano Concerto (1968), the episodes between appearances of the main theme feature references to the previous movements, a process that halts for a moment in the slow middle section. The movement closes on a strident minor second. Corigliano's mixture of traditional forms (although fashioned to fit his needs) and more recent harmonic and melodic styles in the Violin Sonata augurs much to come in the development of his compositional style. - John Palmer at allmusic.com   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is a history of the music and of the people who made, sang and listened to it. It shows the role church music has played in ordinary lives and how it reflects those lives back to us. The author considers why church music remains so popular and frequently tops the classical charts and why the BBC's Choral Evensong remains the longest-running radio series ever. He shows how England's church music follows the contours of its history and is the soundtrack of its changing politics and culture, from the mysteries of the Mass to the elegant decorum of the Restoration anthem, from stern Puritanism to Victorian bombast, and thence to the fractured worlds of the twentieth century as heard in the music of Vaughan Williams and Britten. This is a book for everyone interested in the history of English music, culture and society.""--Publisher's description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Orchestrating Public Opinion,Paul Christiansen,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL20928712W,/authors/OL8011091A/Paul_Christiansen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Amsterdam University Press|Language English,"Orchestrating Public Opinion for the first time examines in detail music's persuasive role in political ads for US presidential campaigns.  Studies on political ads tend to consider music something of an afterthought, innocuous accompaniment for a narrator. In this book Christiansen takes an opposing view, arguing that music is crucial to an ad's construction. In some cases, it is even determinative: that is, all other elements-images, voiceover, sound effects, written text, and so on-can be circumscribed by and interpreted in relation to music. This book presents for the first time correspondence between campaign officials and ad agencies, storyboards, and music scores related to ads such as Eisenhower's ""I Like Ike"" or Reagan's ""Morning in America.""  Engaging music seriously through detailed musical analysis as well as exploring music's relation to visual and textual elements in ads, Orchestrating brings together disparate approaches toward understanding the surreptitious rhetoric of music.

W. Norton|Language English|Pages 449,"The blues grew out of the plantations and prisons, the swampy marshes and fertile cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta. With original research and keen insights, Ted Gioia—the author of a landmark study of West Coast jazz and the critically acclaimed The History of Jazz—brings to life the stirring music of the Delta, evoking the legendary figures who shaped its sound and ethos: Robert Johnson, Charley Patton, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King, and others. Tracing the history of the Delta blues from the field hollers and plantation music of the nineteenth century to the exploits of modern-day musicians in the Delta tradition, Delta Blues tells the full story of this timeless and unforgettable music. No cultural force boasts such humble origins or such world-conquering reverberations. In this evocative rags-to-riches tale, Gioia shows how the sounds of the Delta altered the course of popular music in America and in the world beyond.

Punk Rock So What?brings together a new generation of academics, writers and journalists to provide the first comprehensive assessment of punk and its place in popular music history, culture and myth. The contributors, who include Suzanne Moore, Lucy OBrien, Andy Medhurst, Mark Sinker and Paul Cobley, challenge standard views of punk prevalent since the 1970s. They: * re-situate punk in its historical context, analysing the possible origins of punk in the New York art scene and Manchester clubs as well as in Malcolm McClarens brain* question whether punk deserves its reputation as an anti-fascist, anti-sexist movement which opened up opportunities for women musicians and fans alike. * trace punks long-lasting influence on comics, literature, art and cinema as well as music and fashion, from films such as Sid and Nancy and The Great Rock n Roll Swindle to work by contemporary artists such as Gavin Turk and Sarah Lucas. * discuss the role played by such key figures as Johnny Rotten, Richard Hell, Malcolm McClaren, Mark E. Smith and Viv Albertine. Punk Rock Revisited kicks over the statues of many established beliefs about the meaning of punk, concluding that, if anything, punk was more culturally significant than anybody has yet suggested, but perhaps for different reasons.

The courage of composers and the tyranny of taste,Bálint András Varga,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19750886W,/authors/OL4852505A/Bálint_András_Varga,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 263,"""All-new interviews with 33 of the world's leading composers--from Adams and Crumb to Gubaidulina and Rihm--give unique insights into the creative process. Bálint András Varga is perhaps the world's most respected interviewer of living composers. For The Courage of Composers and the Tyranny of Taste: Reflections on New Music, Varga has confronted thirty-three composers with quotations carefully chosen to elicit their thoughts about an issue that is crucial for any serious creative artist: How can one find courage to deal with the sometimes tyrannical expectations of the outside world? The result is an imaginary roundtable at which we encounter fresh, revealing, previously unpublished statements from such world-renowned composers as John Adams, Friedrich Cerha, George Crumb, Sofia Gubaidulina, Georg Friedrich Haas, Giya Kancheli, György Kurtág, Helmut Lachenmann, Libby Larsen, Robert Morris, and Wolfgang Rihm. Also represented are composers who are becoming more prominent with the passing years--Chaya Czernowin, Pascal Dusapin, and Rebecca Saunders--as well as conductor-composer Michael Gielen, festival director Nicholas Kenyon, and music critics Paul Griffiths and Arnold Whittall. In The Courage of Composers and the Tyranny of Taste, composers and other insightful individuals comment on choices made, traps avoided, unforeseen consequences, proud accomplishments, occasional regrets: the whole range of experiences central to artistic creativity.""--Provided by publisher.

Soziokulturelle Vorgaben wie Zeitgeist, Bildung, Erwartungshaltung und musikalische Sozialisation sind bedingende Faktoren des Hörprozesses, sie reichen jedoch nicht aus, das Phänomen musikalischen Humors zu erklären. Weiterführend ist zu fragen, wo, wann, warum und wieso musikalische Ereignisse überhaupt zum Lachen oder Schmunzeln anregen oder nicht. Sind dem Komponisten und/oder Hörer die Traditionen, Regeln, Normen bestimmter Musiken oder Musikkulturen nicht geläufig, wird er über Humor auslösende Verletzungen, Brüche, geistreiche Anspielungen u. a. m. kaum lachen können, da raffinierte Spielformen des Komischen auch Kritik an ästhetischen Konventionen sind, die sich dynamisch, rhythmisch, tempomäßig, harmonisch, melodisch, satztechnisch, formal oder instrumental artikulieren. Bildungskonzepte sollten also Voraussetzungen bereitstellen, die es Schülern, Kindern, Senioren oder Musiklaien ermöglichen, musikalischen Humor als intellektuelle und/oder emotionale Bereicherung erfahren zu können.

Charles Ives's Concord,Kyle Gann,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19714826W,/authors/OL390335A/Kyle_Gann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 438,"In 1921, insurance executive Charles Ives sent out copies of a piano sonata to two hundred strangers. Laden with dissonant chords, complex rhythm, and a seemingly chaotic structure, the so-called Concord Sonata confounded the recipients, as did the accompanying book, Essays before a Sonata. Kyle Gann merges exhaustive research with his own experience as a composer to reveal the Concord Sonata and the essays in full. Diffracting the twinned works into their essential aspects, Gann lays out the historical context that produced Ives's masterpiece and illuminates the arguments Ives himself explored in the Essays. Gann also provides a movement-by-movement analysis of the work's harmonic structure and compositional technique; connects the sonata to Ives works that share parts of its material; and compares the 1921 version of the Concord with its 1947 revision to reveal important aspects of Ives's creative process. A tour de force of critical, theoretical, and historical thought, Charles Ives's Concord provides nothing less than the first comprehensive consideration of a work at the heart of twentieth century American music.

He created a highly original and distinctive way of seeing the Australian landscape and was passionate about the painting process itself. This is the first major retrospective of Williams' work in over 25 years. It highlights Williams' strength as a painter including important large oil paintings and luminous gouaches to reveal his distinctive approach, often combining a feeling for place with a strong abstract emphasis. Williams' inspiration often emerged from the unique qualities of landscapes around Australia, from Upwey in Victoria to the Bass Strait in Tasmania and the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Although Williams is most often associated with dry environments, some of the surprises in the exhibition are the works that reveal his fascination with water--ponds, rivers, waterfalls and seascapes. The show uncovers other unexpected elements, such as portraits of his family and friends, and delicate studies in gouache of plants and animals.""--Publisher's website.

In Listen But Don't Ask Question Kevin Fellezs examines Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiian) and non-Hawaiian slack key guitar in Hawai'i, California, and Japan, tracing how notions of belonging and authenticity become contested depending on who plays the music and where. In Hawai'i slack key guitar functions as a sign of Kanaka Maoli cultural renewal, resilience, and resistance in the face of appropriation and occupation, while in Japan it becomes the means through which to create a merged Japanese-Hawaiian artistic and cultural sensibility. For diasporic Hawaiians in California, it provides with a way to claim Hawaiian identity. By demonstrating how slack key guitar is a site for the articulation of Hawaiian-ness Fellezs illuminates how slack key guitarists are reconfiguring notions of Hawaiian belonging throughout the Transpacific.""--Provided by publisher.

Composers and performers sometimes alter the expected rhythm or tempo in order to enhance the expressive power of the music. The technique has been variously described by theorists and composers as 'an honest theft', 'a pernicious nuisance', even 'seductive' (by Franz Liszt), yet it remains integral to the performance and history of music."" ""Professor Hudson's book is the first to present the complex history of this device. He identifies and traces the development of two main types of rubato: an earlier one in which note values in a melody are altered while the accompaniment keeps strict time, and a later, more familiar one in which the tempo of the entire musical substance fluctuates. In the course of his narrative he ranges widely over Western music, from Gregorian Chant to Chopin, from C. P. E. Bach to jazz, quoting extensively from the writings of theorists, composers, and performers. In so doing he not only suggests new ways of approaching rubato in the music of nineteenth-century composers such as Chopin and Liszt, where we expect to encounter the term, but also illuminates the music of earlier and later periods, revealing its use even in the music of that most metronomic of composers, Stravinsky. As such his book will be of wide interest and of particular relevance to performers. The text is illustrated throughout by nearly 140 music examples and a number of illustrations.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Written in Paris at the height of the Belle Époque, Debussy's works reflect not only the most appealing and innocent aspects of Paris but also the more disquieting attitudes of the time such as racism, colonial domination, and nationalistic hostility. Pianist Catherine Kautsky reveals little-known elements of Parisian culture and weaves the music, the man, the city, and the era into an indissoluble portrait that will delight anyone who has ever been entranced by Debussy's music or the city that inspired it. --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the dominance of the blues singer over his ""woman"" to the sensitive singer/songwriter, popular music artists have adopted various gendered personae in a search for new forms of expression. Sometimes these roles shift as the singer ages, attitudes change, or new challenges on the pop scene arise; other times, the persona hardens into a shell-like mask that the performer struggles to escape.  Oh Boy! Masculinities and Popular Music is the first serious study of how forms of masculinity are negotiated, constructed, represented and addressed across a range of popular music texts and practices. Written by a group of internationally recognized popular music scholars-including Sheila Whiteley, Richard Middleton, and Judith Halberstam-these essays study the concept of masculinity in performance and appearance, and how both male and female artists have engaged with notions of masculinity in popular music."" - Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Music therapy as a profession is about 30 years old. This book, in a sense, is paradox. It is an attempt to touch the essence of music in the fullness of all her healing powers, to describe that which cannot be described. This attempt is made in the spirit of appreciation and perhaps as a tribute to the mind of man. Words can never reach far enough into music to touch her essence. However, with the trying, our words will become more musical, our respect and wonder more absorbing, our understanding of music deeper. Allow your soul to join the massive mythic artery which carries us to the essence of life and the human spirit, connecting us to all of life, before and after, around and in us, from the first moment of creation through all the transformations beyond time and space. For this is the healing experience of music. - Foreword & preface.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Norton|Language Latin|Pages 496,"In this carefully selected anthology, the author of Renaissance Music presents full scores for all the music highlighted in the companion text -- a total of 102 works for complete movements by some 75 composers. The Anthology of Renaissance Music may also be used independently of the book, as a well-balanced collection for students and teachers of the era's music. The list of works spans the period from the early 15th century to the late 16th. Here we find carols, motets, Mass movements, a Magnificat setting, chansons, frottole, Lieder, madrigals, instrumental canzonas and toccatas, Anglican services -- in short, all the important forms and many of the minor ones. Readers will also be pleased to find examples of the many compositional techniques used by Renaissance composers, as well as music in a variety of styles representing the major European nationality and language areas. For each selection, the best available edition has been reproduced; where no satisfactory edition existed, the piece has been specially set for this volume. English translations are provided for all foreign-language texts. Given the recent surging interest in music of the Renaissance, students, teachers, and music lovers will find this generously designed and practical anthology a most welcome addition to their libraries. - Back cover.

Boston Globe jazz writer and Emerson College professor Bill Beuttler reveals new ways in which jazz is engaging with society through the vivid biographies and music of Jason Moran, Vijay Iyer, Rudresh Mahanthappa, The Bad Plus, Miguel Zenón, Anat Cohen, Robert Glasper, and Esperanza Spalding. These musicians are freely incorporating other genres of music into jazz—from classical (both western and Indian) to popular (hip-hop, Ramp;B, rock, bluegrass, klezmer, Brazilian choro)—and other art forms as well (literature, film, photography, and other visual arts). This new generation of jazz is increasingly more international and is becoming more open to women as instrumentalists and bandleaders. Contemporary jazz is reasserting itself as a force for social change, prompted by developments such as the Black Lives Matter, #MeToo movements, and the election of Donald Trump.

It would take all his skills to win back Miss Davis, especially, faith. In All I want for Christmas, identical twin boys Zeke and Zack wished for only one gift from Santa this year: a new mom! But convincing their love-wary dad that their music teacher, Miss Davis is his destiny and part of Santa's plan, isn't as easy as they'd hoped.

But when a very beautiful and very pregnant woman ended up at his remote cabin during a blizzard, the desperate, alone, and on-the-run Laura brought him the gifts of passion, hope and life. The modern-day Scrooge couldn't turn her away, if he only has the courage to reach for the gifts she brought.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

Metal Health'll drive you mad!"" -- Quiet RiotLike an episode of VH1's Behind the Music on steroids, Bang Your Head is an epic history of every band and every performer that has proudly worn the Heavy Metal badge. Whether headbanging is your guilty pleasure or you firmly believe that this much-maligned genre has never received the respect it deserves, Bang Your Head is a must-read that pays homage to a music that's impossible to ignore, especially when being blasted through a sixteen-inch woofer.Charting the genesis of early metal with bands like Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden; the rise of metal to the top of the Billboard charts and heavy MTV rotation featuring the likes of Def Leppard and Metallica; hitting its critical peak with bands like Guns N' Roses; disgrace during the ""hair metal"" '80s; and a demise fueled by the explosion of the Seattle grunge scene and the ""alternative"" revolution, Bang Your Head is as funny as it is informative and proves once and for all that there is more to metal than sin, sex, and spandex.To write this exhaustive history, David Konow spent three years interviewing the bands, wives, girlfriends, ex-wives, groupies, managers, record company execs, and anyone who was or is a part of the metal scene, including many of the band guys often better known for their escapades and bad behavior than for their musicianship. Nothing is left unsaid in this jaw-dropping, funny, and entertaining chronicle of power ballads, outrageous outfits, big hair, bigger egos, and testosterone-drenched debauchery.From the Trade Paperback edition.

We all have songs that have a special meaning in our lives; hearing them evokes a special time or place. Little wonder that these special songs have become enduring classics. Nothing brings the roarin '20s to life like ""Tea for Two"" or ""I'm just Wild About Harry""; the Great Depression is evoked in all of its pain and misery in songs like ""Brother Can You Spare a Dime?; ""God Bless America"" revives the powerful hope that American democracy promised to the world during the dark days of World War II; ""Young at Heart"" evokes the postwar optimism of the '50s. And then there are the countless songs of love, new romance, and heartbreak: ""As Time Goes By,"" ""Always,"" ""Am I Blue""...the list is endless.Along with telling the stories behind these songs, America's Songs suggests, simply and succinctly, what makes a song great. The book illuminates the way each great song melds words and music -    sentiment and melody - into a seamless whole. America's Songs also traces the fascinating but mysterious process of collaboration, the give-and-take between two craftsmen, a composer and a lyricist, as they combined their talents to create a song.For anyone interested in the history of the songs that America loves, America's Songs will make for fascinating reading.

This is the first new English translation of Berlioz's complete text since 1856, and it is accompanied throughout by Hugh Macdonald's extensive and authoritative commentary on the instruments of Berlioz's time and on his own orchestral practice, as revealed in his scores. It also includes extracts from Berlioz's writings on instruments in his Memoirs and in his many articles for the Parisian press. The Treatise has been highly valued both for its technical information about instruments but also for its poetic and visionary approach to the art of instrumentation. Berlioz was not only one of the great orchestrators of the nineteenth century, he was also the author with the clearest understanding of the art.

Under the guidance of their front man, Philip Tonka, the Danes embark on a harrowing journey through the scorching desert--a trip that takes Tonka into the heart of an ominous and twisted conspiracy.

A high-school dropout, she's not sure how she got the job - but she's been sent by her Australian newspaper right to the heart of the London music scene at the most exciting time in music history: 1967. Lola spends her days planning diets and interviewing rock stars. In London, Mick Jagger makes her a cup of tea, Jimi Hendrix (possibly) propositions her and Cher borrows her false eyelashes. At the Monterey International Pop Festival, Lola props up Brian Jones and talks to Janis Joplin about sex. In Los Angeles, she discusses being overweight with Mama Cass and tries to pluck up the courage to ask Cher to return those false eyelashes. Lola has an irrepressible curiosity, but she begins to wonder whether the questions she asks these extraordinary young musicians are really a substitute for questions about her parents' calamitous past that can't be asked or answered. As Lola moves on through marriage, motherhood, psychoanalysis and a close relationship with an unexpected pair of detectives, she discovers the question of what it means to be human is the hardest one for anyone-including herself-to answer""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Body Piercing Saved My Life is the first in-depth journalistic investigation into a subculture so large that it's erroneous to even call it a subculture: Christian rock. Christian rock culture is booming, not only with bands but with extreme teen Bibles, skateboarding ministries, Christian tattoo parlors, paintball parks, coffeehouses, and nightclubs,encouraging kids to form their own communities apart from the mainstream. Profiling such successful Christian rock bands as P.O.D., Switchfoot, Creed, Evanescence, and Sixpence None the Richer, as well as the phenomenally successful Seattle Christian record label Tooth & Nail, enormous Christian rock festivals, and more, Spin journalist Andrew Beaujon lifts the veil on a thriving scene that operates beneath the secular world's radar.

Most know him for his classic musical reworking of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as Broadway's West Side Story. But Bernstein accomplished so much more as a composer, and his body of work is both broad and varied. He composed ballets (Fancy Free, Facsimile, Dybbuk), operas (Trouble in Tahiti, Candide, A Quiet Place), musicals (On the Town, Wonderful Town), film scores (On the Waterfront), symphonies, choral works, chamber music pieces, art songs, and piano works. In Experiencing Leonard Bernstein: A Listener's Companion, Kenneth LaFave guides readers past Bernstein's famously tortured personal problems and into the clarity and balance of his Serenade after Plato's Symposium for Violin and Orchestra, the intense drama of his music for On the Waterfront, the existential cosmography of his three symphonies, and his vibrant works for the musical stage. Perhaps the most famous American classical musician born in the twentieth century, Bernstein divided his time between composing, conducting, writing, and teaching, a busy schedule -- especially his conducting of major orchestras -- that set his work as composer at a disadvantage. Often generated in short spurts, his work carries an urgency -- and even an element of improvisational genius -- that he flavored with his eclectic embrace of jazz, folk song, Jewish cantorial music, and innovations in contemporary classical theory. The result is a body of work that is beguilingly melodic, incomparably rhythmic, and irrepressibly individual. Experiencing Leonard Bernstein: A Listener's Companion is the ideal work for any reader seeking to learn how to listen across the spectrum of Bernstein's musical output. - Back cover.

It was written in 1974 when sythesizers had just become available for consumer use and many who had been exposed to the sound had nowhere to turn to learn how to play one.  The book is divided into three parts: Theory, Operation and Application.  The reader is taken through an introduction to waveforms, overtones and harmonics as well as filters and voltage control.  The second part is the actual operation of the machine itself. How to use the controls. The final part is the application or hands on of using an ARP Odyssey synthesizer and setting up your own music studio. While some may find this book dated in terms of the ultra-complex digital workstations of this day, the fact that the Odyssey was reintroduced this year (2016) would indicate it will be well read again.

As Britain celebrates the new millennium, something fluorescent and futuristic is stirring in the crumbling council estates of inner city London. Making beats on stolen software, spitting lyrics on tower block rooftops and beaming out signals from pirate radio aerials, a group of teenagers raised on UK garage, American hip-hop and Jamaican reggae stumble upon a dazzling new genre. Against all odds, these young MCs will grow up to become some of the UK's most famous musicians, scoring number one records and dominating British pop culture for years to come. Hip-hop royalty will fawn over them, billion dollar brands will queue up to beg for their endorsements and through their determined DIY ethics they'll turn the music industry's logic on its head. But getting there won't be easy. Successive governments will attempt to control their music, their behaviour and even their clothes. The media will demonise them and the police will shut down their clubs. National radio stations and live music venues will ban them. There will be riots, fighting in the streets, and even murder. And the inner city landscape that shaped them will be changed beyond all recognition. Drawn from over a decade of in-depth interviews and research with all the key MCs, DJs and industry players, in this extraordinary book the UK's greatest grime journalist Dan Hancox tells the remarkable story of how a group of outsiders from the margins of urban life went on to create a genre that has become a British institution. Here, for the first time, is the full story of grime.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Roots, radicals and rockers",Billy Bragg,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19710907W,/authors/OL2712281A/Billy_Bragg,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27757577M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 431,"""Emerging from the jazz clubs of the early 1950s, skiffle -- a uniquely British take on American folk and blues -- caused a sensation among a generation of kids who had grown up during the dreary post-war years. These were Britain's first teenagers, looking for a music of their own in a culture dominated by crooners and mediated by a stuffy BBC. Sales of guitars rocketed from 5,000 to 250,000 a year, and -- as with the punk rock that would flourish two decades later -- all you needed to know were three guitar chords to form your own group, with your mates accompanying on tea-chest bass and washboard. Against a backdrop of Cold War politics, rock and roll riots and a newly assertive working-class youth, Billy Bragg charts -- for the first time in depth -- the history, impact and legacy of Britain's original pop movement. It's a story of jazz pilgrims and blues blowers, Teddy Boys and beatnik girls, coffee-bar bohemians and refugees from the McCarthyite witch-hunts, who between them sparked a revolution that shaped pop culture as we have come to know it""--Page 2 of dust jacket.

The book tracks the life and times of the fallen township pop princess, her plummet from grace, disastrous relationships with men, her addiction to cocaine, and finally her hard-fought battle back to sanity and her real love, music. Seen through Melinda's sharp and always original eye, The Kelly Khumalo Story promises to be a page turner from start to finish. Now reunited with Kelly, manager Sarah Setlaelo, in her contributions to the book, offers a rare glimpse into the backstage of the South African music industry, rife with sensation and backstabbing. It is a tale of highs, lows and personal triumph. Ultimately the real question is: can Kelly come back from the edge? -- Publisher's description.

Her mundane routine is shattered when summoned to her father's deathbed. Shortly thereafter the Earl of Devonwych dies and much to her astonishment bequeaths Diantha a modest fortune with strings attached. She will lose most of her inheritance unless she marries his protege, Sebastian, Marquess of Ravistock.  Sebastian is equally jarred by the terms of his mentor's will. His lineage demands he look higher for a wife than Devonwych's by-blow. Yet he feels honor-bound to keep his promise to the earl, to protect Diantha from her half brother Basil's wrath.  Rising to the challenge, the marquess solemnly swears to foil all of Basil's greedy schemes. Yet, while preoccupied with playing her knight-errant, Sebastian somehow loses his heart to an equally smitten Diantha.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|12 Have read

His travel articles, essays, and tributes to actors, musicians, sex kittens, and thinkers have appeared in publications ranging from Esquire to Harper's, from Playboy to the New York Times, High Times, and Life.  A generous sampling, collected here for the first time and including works as diverse as scholarly art criticism and some decidedly untypical country-music lyrics, Wild Ducks Flying Backward offers a rare sweeping overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original.Whether he is rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso's Guernica, lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls ""the genius waitress,"" Robbins's briefer writings often exhibit the same five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language.Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are a couple of short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an off-beat assessment of our divided nation.  And wherever we open Wild Ducks Flying Backward, we're apt to encounter examples of the intently serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described ""romantic Zen hedonist"" and ""stray dog in the banquet halls of culture.""From the Hardcover edition.

They must sing. A century ago, the Sentience Wars tore the galaxy apart and nearly ended the entire concept of intelligent space-faring life. In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented by the remnants of civilization. Something to cheer up everyone who was left. Something to celebrate having escaped total annihilation by the skin of one's teeth, if indeed one has skin. Or teeth. Something to bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, understanding, and the most powerful of all social bonds: excluding others. Once every cycle, the great galactic civilizations gather for Galactivision--part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part, a very large, but very subtle part, continuation of the wars of the past. Thus, a fragile peace has held. This year, a bizarre and unsightly species has looked up from its muddy planet-bound cradle and noticed the enormous universe blaring on around it: humanity. Where they expected to one day reach out into space and discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of grave aliens, they have found glitter. And lipstick. And pyrotechnics. And electric guitars. A band of human musicians, dancers, and roadies have been chosen to represent their planet on the greatest stage in the galaxy.

Lost in Los Angeles, he was ravaged by cocaine abuse, overwork, and an obsession with the occult, while his marriage lay in tatters. Desperate to reignite his creative spark, Bowie relocated in mid-1976 to Berlin, accompanied by an equally troubled Iggy Pop, former Stooges front man. The move to Berlin proved fortuitous both personally and professionally. There he produced two of Iggy Pop's best albums and starred in Just a Gigolo. Most importantly, he wrote and recorded three of his finest works — Low, Heroes, and Lodger — with the help of such legends as Brian Eno, Tony Visconti, and Robert Fripp. New Music Night and Day explores the sometimes dark forces that fueled Bowie's artistry during the time and the creation of these albums. The book explores how the albums ushered rock and pop into the electronic era and examines their continued influence on the contemporary musical landscape.

It encompasses the syllabusses for the old CSE, GCE and royal schools of music grade V and more.  My view is it is the best text book of basic music and goes surprisingly far in  melody, harmony, score reading and musical form. It then covers musical instruments and and flies through a heistsory of serious western music.  Compact and well paced, with plenty of exercises, it is good for self study.

In this wideranging and searching study, Professor Williams, one of the leading Bach scholars of our time, helps them probe its depths and understand its uniqueness. He considers the work's historical origins, especially in relation to all Bach's Clavier¸bung volumes and late keyboard works, its musical agenda and its formal shape, and discusses significant performance issues. In the course of the book he poses a number of key questions. Why should such a work be written? Does the work have both a conceptual and a perceptual shape? What other music is likely to have influenced the Goldberg and to what extent is it trying to be encyclopedic? What is the canonic vocabulary? How have contemporaries or musicians from Beethoven to the present day seen this work and, above all, how has its mysterious beauty been created?

In an age when famous rock groups charge $100 or more for a concert ticket, their tribute band imitators offer an accessible, intimate, and surprisingly authentic outlet for fans. The Grateful Dead have Dark Star Orchestra; Led Zeppelin Zoso, Hammer of the Gods, and the all-girl Lez Zeppelin; Van Halen have twenty-five tribute bands, including Hot for Teacher and Van Heineken; and KISS have not one but two tribute bands peopled by dwarves--Mini Kiss and Tiny Kiss. In this droll and entertaining expedition to the heart of tribute world, Steven Kurutz chronicles the ups and downs of one of the oldest and best-established acts, Sticky Fingers, who bill themselves as ""the leading international Rolling Stones tribute show."" The narrative follows Sticky Fingers as they shadow the real Rolling Stones 2005--06 tour like a remora trailing a shark. When the Stones perform at an arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, Sticky Fingers plays a preconcert bash at nearby Dixie's Tavern. More gigs follow: a trip to Las Vegas, bookings on the southern fraternity circuit, a spectacular sold-out stadium show in the Netherlands. The band's frontman, Glen Carroll, is a roguish and colorful Mick Jagger look-alike, and we see him onstage and off, navigating the peculiar life of a tribute performer. As Carroll says, ""I know what it's like to walk in Mick's shoes--with lift supports, mind you."" The band's guitarist, meanwhile, is so committed to his role as Keith Richards, he's always in costume. Along the way, the writer travels with the members of Sticky Fingers' archrivals, the Blushing Brides; profiles a group of Deadheads who re-create entire, highly specific Grateful Dead concerts, and examines an occupational hazard one musician calls ""tributitis"": identifying too closely with the rock star one portrays, with resulting swelling of the ego. As the book unfolds, what emerges is an honest and sympathetic portrait of the musicians as they juggle work and band obligations and come to terms with middle age and their fading dreams of rock stardom.Like a Rolling Stone is a superbly reported, affectionately told, hilarious account of life at the lower altitudes of the music industry. In its own sly way, it is also a critique of the Rolling Stones' stadium juggernaut and the baby boomer nostalgia pervading modern culture. Above all, it is a testament to the timeless appeal of rock and roll, even in a culture of perpetual rewind.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Tokyo boogie-woogie,Hiromu Nagahara,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19714860W,/authors/OL7523095A/Hiromu_Nagahara,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26927997M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Harvard University Press|Language English|Pages 273,"Between the late 1920s and 1960s, Japan's recording industry produced songs that they simply labeled, ""Popular Songs"" (ryūkōka). Emerging within the context of the dramatic expansion of mass media during some of the most volatile decades in Japanese history, this musical genre came to occupy the mainstream of Japan's commercial music scene. Tokyo Boogie-Woogie is the first book-length, historical study in English of this musical phenomenon and its impact on the politics of culture in modern Japan. The book focuses on the broad range of self-appointed popular song critics, including musicians, intellectuals, political activists, and government officials, all of whom engaged in a series of contentious debates on these songs' cultural and social merits, or, more frequently, the lack thereof.--  ""In this first English-language history of the origins and impact of the Japanese pop music industry, Hiromu Nagahara connects the rise of mass entertainment, epitomized by ryåukåoka (""popular songs""), with Japan's transformation into a middle-class society in the years after World War II. With the arrival of major international recording companies like Columbia and Victor in the 1920s, Japan's pop music scene soon grew into a full-fledged culture industry that reached out to an avid consumer base through radio, cinema, and other media. The stream of songs that poured forth over the next four decades represented something new in the nation's cultural landscape. Emerging during some of the most volatile decades in Japan's history, popular songs struck a deep chord in Japanese society, gaining a devoted following but also galvanizing a vociferous band of opponents. A range of critics--intellectuals, journalists, government officials, self-appointed arbiters of taste--engaged in contentious debates on the merits of pop music. Many regarded it as a scandal, evidence of an increasingly debased and Americanized culture. For others, popular songs represented liberation from the oppressive political climate of the war years. Tokyo Boogie-Woogie is a tale of competing cultural dynamics coming to a head just as Japan's traditionally hierarchical society was shifting toward middle-class democracy. The pop soundscape of these years became the audible symbol of changing times.""--Publisher's description.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When Alice Cooper became the stuff of legend in the early '70s, their shows were monuments of fun and invention. Riding on a string of hits like ""I'm 18"" and ""School's Out,"" they became America's highest-grossing act, producing four platinum albums and hitting number one on the U.S. and U.K. charts with Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. Their utterly original performance style and look, known as Shock Rock, was swiftly copied by countless bands. Dennis Dunaway, the bassist and co-songwriter for the band, tells a story just as over-the-top crazy as their (in)famous shows. As teenagers in Phoenix, Dennis Dunaway and lead singer Vince Furnier, who would later change his name to Alice Cooper, formed a hard-knuckles band that played prisons, cowboy bars and teen clubs. Their journey took them from Hollywood to the ferocious Detroit music scene, along the way adding new dimensions of rock theater. From struggling for recognition to topping the charts, the Alice Cooper group was entertaining, outrageous, and one-of-a-kind. Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs! is the riveting account of the band's creation in the '60s, strange glory in the '70s, and the legendary characters they met along the way""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

These early works, characterized by a relentless pulse and static harmony, focused single-mindedly on the process of gradual rhythmic change.

These 64 short pieces include Reich's 1968 essay ""Music as a Gradual Process,"" widely considered one of the most influential pieces of music theory in the second half of the 20th century.
