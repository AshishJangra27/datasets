Drawing on 180 interviews, including sit-downs with top government officials and Wall Street CEOs, Lowenstein tells, with grace, wit, and razor-sharp understanding, the full story of the end of Wall Street as we knew it. Displaying the qualities that made When Genius Failed a timeless classic of Wall Street-his sixth sense for narrative drama and his unmatched ability to tell complicated financial stories in ways that resonate with the ordinary reader-Roger Lowenstein weaves a financial, economic, and sociological thriller that indicts America for succumbing to the siren song of easy debt and speculative mortgages.The End of Wall Street is rife with historical lessons and bursting with fast-paced action. Lowenstein introduces his story with precisely etched, laserlike profiles of Angelo Mozilo, the Johnny Appleseed of subprime mortgages who spreads toxic loans across the landscape like wild crabapples, and moves to a damning explication of how rating agencies helped gift wrap faulty loans in the guise of triple-A paper and a takedown of the academic formulas that-once again- proved the ruin of investors and banks. Lowenstein excels with a series of searing profiles of banking CEOs, such as the ferretlike Dick Fuld of Lehman and the bloodless Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, and of government officials from the restless, deal-obsessed Hank Paulson and the overmatched Tim Geithner to the cerebral academic Ben Bernanke, who sought to avoid a repeat of the one crisis he spent a lifetime trying to understand-the Great Depression.Finally, we come to understand the majesty of Lowenstein's theme of liquidity and capital, which explains the origins of the crisis and that positions the collapse of 2008 as the greatest ever of Wall Street's unlearned lessons. The End of Wall Street will be essential reading as we work to identify the lessons of the market failure and start to rebuild.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Despite these economies' significant growth potential, their corporate and government sectors do not generate the financial instruments to provide residents with adequate stores of value. Capital often flows out of these economies seeking these stores of value in the developed world. Bubbles are beneficial because they provide domestic stores of value and thereby reduce capital outflows while increasing investment. But they come at a cost, as they expose the country to bubble-crashes and capital flow reversals. We show that domestic financial underdevelopment not only facilitates the emergence of bubbles, but also leads agents to undervalue the aggregate risk embodied in financial bubbles. In this context, even rational bubbles can be welfare reducing. We study a set of aggregate risk management policies to alleviate the bubble-risk. We show that liquidity requirements, sterilization of capital inflows and structural policies aimed at developing public debt markets ""collateralized"" by future revenues, all have a high payoff in this environment. Keywords: Emerging markets, bubbles, excess volatility, crashes, capital flow reversals, public debt market, financial underdevelopment, dynamic inefficiency.

The high level of turnover indicates that the forex market is an efficient market, ie price discovery is sound. It is a quote-driven market (as opposed to an order-driven market) and it is firmly the banks’ province. They quote bid and offer rates simultaneously once the volume of the transaction is disclosed, and the quote recipient can deal either side of the quote. As in the spot forex market, the derivative forex market is efficient, allowing, for example, a company to do a large forward deal as quickly as a spot deal.

We, the public, accept the following as money (M) (that is, the means of payments / medium of exchange): notes and coins (N&C) and bank deposits (BD). Because we do, we place banks in a unique situation: the major part of their liabilities is BD; therefore they are able to create BD simply by making loans. Because banks are aggressive competitors and their creditworthiness checks on customers are therefore not always sober, they are inherently unstable.

Money Creation: An Introduction,A. P.

The largest component of the money stock, bank deposits, is created by accounting entries. Many texts which cover money creation regard the reserve requirement (RR) as being at the very centre of the process, and many still regard the process as starting with a bank receiving a new deposit (placing the required reserves with the central bank, lending out the rest, which then arrives back in the banking system as a deposit; then the reserve requirement based on this deposit is placed with the central bank ... and so on until the process ends with the factor new deposit x 1 / RR ratio). There are countries which do not have a RR, and money is still created in these countries, because money is bank deposits in the main and these are created when banks make loans. The RR is just one of the many factors that impact on bank liquidity.  You can download the book for free via the link below.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Results to the questionnaire were obtained in October 2008 from 25 countries, mostly European, seven South-American countries, two from Asia and Australia. The responding countries differ widely insize, role and organisation of football in society (ranging from large countries with big football leagues tosmaller nations or nations with only non-professional football). Differences in information, position andinterest in the person or organisation that provided the answers (national football association, governmentrepresentatives, national FIUs, the police or judicial authorities) needed to be taken into consideration aswell.Following the analysis of questionnaires, a workshop on money laundering and the footballsector was held in Monaco in November 2008 as part of the 2008 FATF/MONEYVAL Typologiesmeeting. This workshop was very well supported by members of the FATF, MONEYVAL andrepresentatives of other countries. The following participants were involved in the 2-day breakout sessionwhich considered issues in depth: Belgium, Brazil, Cyprus, Egmont Group, France, International OlympicCommittee (IOC), Ireland, Italy, Monaco, Norway, Russia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, theNetherlands and the United Kingdom.The study has also relied on the experience and cooperation of the private sector. Arepresentative of the IOC attended the Monaco workshop in November 2008. Consultation withrepresentatives of the Fe de ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and of the Union ofEuropean Football Associations (UEFA) also took place in January and April 2009.

But for readers who want a more humorous look at retaking control of the household budget, well, he humbly recommends his own Total Money Meltdown. After all, he won't be able to repay his debts from the sales of Dave Ramsey's book. Thor Ramsey's sidesplitting guide to financial recovery chronicles his own bad financial decisions and what it took him to climb out of the hole he dug. (""By the way, you should only dig holes if you plan on filling them with treasure."") Not just a vehicle for his wit and humor, Thor Ramsey's Total Money Meltdown also provides readers with the necessary tools and biblical motivation to become financially free. The truth is that all of us who've been in financial trouble knew better. But sometimes we don't know what it takes to get out of the hole. We feel hopeless and overwhelmed. This book shines some funny hope into people's messy money lives, first as a ""how not-to guide"" and then as a ""how-to recover guide.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through developing sophisticated understandings of the nature and wealth-creating capacity of capital, Christian theologians, philosophers, and financiers exerted considerable influence upon the emergence and development of the international financial systems that helped unleash a revolution in the way the world thinks about and uses capital. In For God and Profit, Samuel Gregg underscores the different ways in which Christians have helped to develop the financial and banking systems that have helped millions escape poverty for hundreds of years. But he also provides a critical lens through which to assess the workings—and failures—of modern finance and banking. Far from being doomed to producing economic instability and periodic financial crises, Gregg illustrates that how Christian faith and reason can shape financial practices and banking institutions in ways that restore integrity to our troubled financial systems.

Pri tome je značajnu ulogu imala i odigrala Centralna banka,  Narodna banka Jugoslavije. Ona je, po mišljenju autora, mnogo doprinela da se barem delimično premoste izvori nelikvidnosti i omogući normalno funkcionisanje jugoslovenske privrede. Pri tome Centralna banka ne može biti jedini faktor eliminisanja nelikvidnosti. Jer, po mišljenju dr Nikole Miljanića, koji je dva puta uzastopno bio guverner Narodne banke : ""Ako se mere Narodne banke upotrebe samostalno, bez uticaja drugio činilaca ekonomske politike, onda će te mere učiniti više štete nego koristi, bilo da ih upotrebljavaš za smanjenje nelikvidnosti ili za povećanje rasta privrede.""

The design of financial systems,Robert C. Merton,finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL4784777W,/authors/OL1006011A/Robert_C._Merton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper proposes a functional approach to designing and managing the financial systems of countries, regions, firms, households, and other entities.  It is a synthesis of the neoclassical, neo-institutional, and behavioral perspectives.  Neoclassical theory is an ideal driver to link science and global practice in finance because its prescriptions are robust across time and geopolitical borders.  By itself, however, neoclassical theory provides little prescription or prediction of the institutional structure of financial systems that is, the specific kinds of financial intermediaries, markets, and regulatory bodies that will or should evolve in response to underlying changes in technology, politics, demographics, and cultural norms.  The neoclassical model therefore offers important, but incomplete, guidance to decision makers seeking to understand and manage the process of institutional change.  In accomplishing this task, the neo-institutional and behavioral perspectives can be very useful.  In this proposed synthesis of the three approaches, functional and structural finance (FSF), institutional structure is endogenous.  When particular transaction costs or behavioral patterns produce large departures from the predictions of the ideal frictionless' neoclassical equilibrium for a given institutional structure, new institutions tend to develop that partially offset the resulting inefficiencies.  In the longer run, after institutional structures have had time to fully develop, the predictions of the neoclassical model will be approximately valid for asset prices and resource allocations.  Through a series of examples, the paper sets out the reasoning behind the FSF synthesis and illustrates its application""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

In these data sets, the residuals may be correlated across firms and across time, and OLS standard errors can be biased.  Historically, the two literatures have used different solutions to this problem.  Corporate finance has relied on Rogers standard errors, while asset pricing has used the Fama-MacBeth procedure to estimate standard errors.  This paper will examine the different methods used in the literature and explain when the different methods yield the same (and correct) standard errors and when they diverge.  The intent is to provide intuition as to why the different approaches sometimes give different answers and give researchers guidance for their use""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

In this paper we make the case for liberalization despite the occurrence of crises.  We show that in developing countries trade liberalization has typically been followed by financial liberalization, which has indeed led to financial fragility and a greater incidence of crises.  However, financial liberalization also has led to higher GDP growth.  In fact, the fastest-growing countries are typically those that have experienced boom-bust cycles.  That is, there is a positive link between GDP growth and the bumpiness of credit, which is captured by the negative skewness --not by the variance-- of credit growth.  To substantiate our interpretation of the data we present a model that shows why in countries with severe credit market imperfections, liberalization leads to higher growth and, as a by-product, to financial fragility.  Thus, occasional crises need not forestall growth and may even be a necessary component of a developing country's growth experience.  Finally, our analysis indicates that foreign direct investment does not obviate the need for risky international bank flows, as the latter are the only source of financing for most firms in the nontradables sector""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

When generations overlap, this failure can be mitigated by properly designed social arrangements.  We show that public financing of education and public pensions can be designed to implement an intergenerational transfer scheme supporting the complete market allocation.  Neither the public financing of education nor the pension scheme we consider resemble standard ones.  In our mechanism, via the public education system, the young borrow from the middle aged to invest in human capital.  They pay back the debt via a social security tax, the proceedings of which finance pension payments.  When the complete market allocation is achieved, the rate of return implicit in this borrowing-lending scheme should equal the market rate of return""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site.

Has the unified budget undermined the federal government trust funds?,Sita Nataraj,finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL5889800W,/authors/OL1452700A/Sita_Nataraj,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""In order to ease the burden on workers during the retirement of the baby boom generation, the 1983 Social Security Reforms set payroll taxes above the level needed to pay current benefits, thus partially prefunding the baby boomers' retirement.  The military and civil service retirement programs followed suit in the mid-1980s and switched from pay-as-you-go financing to funded systems.  The excess income generated by these retirement programs was held in the federal trust funds, which have accumulated almost $3 trillion since the reforms took place.  However, this paper presents evidence that the trust fund build-up may not help future generations due to the adoption of the Unified Budget in 1970.  The Unified Budget includes trust fund receipts as income and trust fund payments as expenditures.  The empirical evidence suggests that attempts to balance the Unified Budget while the trust funds were generating surpluses has led to increased government spending and personal and corporation income tax cuts within the rest of the federal government.  There is no evidence of increased government saving as a result of the trust fund accumulations.  An alternate theory of increased national saving is also explored, where increased payroll taxes accompanied by decreased income taxes induces higher personal saving.  This mechanism, suggested by Diamond, also does not appear to have significantly enhanced the wealth of future generations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

There is no clear or coherent plan, program, or budget that reflects the fact the nation is at war and no credible mix of force plans, modernization plans, and procurement plans for the future. The combined cost of war, steadily rising military manpower costs, the underfunding of operations and maintenance, and a procurement crisis in every service will force the next Administration to reshape almost every aspect of current defense plans, programs, and budgets. This briefing provides an overview of the major issues and trends involved, drawing on data developed by the Department of Defense, Department of State, OMB, the Congressional Budget Office, Congressional Research Office, and General Accountability Office.

Firm financing in India,Inessa Love,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5699007W,/authors/OL1386716A/Inessa_Love,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  World Bank|Language English,"""Using balance sheet information for nearly 6,000 firms between 1994-2003, Love and Martinez Peria investigate recent firm financing patterns in India.  They document the overall use of debt and, in particular, the role of bank financing (short-term and long-term), trade credit, intra-business group borrowing, and foreign financing.  The authors examine financing patterns over time and explore differences across firms by sector, age, ownership type, export orientation, and, in particular, size.  In terms of trends, they find that while debt to asset ratios have been relatively stable, nominal debt growth has slowed down in recent years.  At the same time, firms' repayment capacity, as measured by the interest coverage ratio, has exhibited a U-shaped pattern falling during 1997-99 and recovering in recent years.  Throughout the period of study, bank financing as a share of total debt has increased, while borrowing from nonbank financial institutions fell sharply.  In terms of differences across firms, the most robust finding is that debt levels increase with firm size.  Smaller firms have especially less debt relative to larger firms if they are young (below 10 years since incorporation), if they are in the manufacturing sector, and if they are located in Southern India.  Furthermore, while the ratio of debt to assets has been relatively stable for large firms, the authors observe a significant decline for smaller firms.  Overall, the findings presented provide suggestive (but not definite) evidence of stronger credit constraints for smaller firms.

Inferences are drawn from the 1999 Survey of financial security, with some comparisons to earlier wealth surveys from 1977 and 1984.  I find cross-sectional evidence for asset decumulation at older ages when annuitized assets like pension wealth are included in the analysis.  I also find that the portfolio share of financial assets increases sharply with age, while indicators of risk tolerance appear to decrease.  This is consistent with families desiring more liquid and less risky assets as they age""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Authors have examined efficiency by looking at the spread of the gold points, gold point violations, the flow of gold, or by tests of various asset market criteria, including speculative efficiency and interest arbitrage.  These studies have suffered from many limitations, both methodological and empirical.  We offer a new methodology for measuring market integration based on nonlinear theoretical models and threshold autoregressions.  We also compile a new, high-frequency series of continuous daily data from 1879 to 1913.  We can derive reasonable econometric estimates of the implied gold points and price dynamics.  The changes in these measures over time provide an insight into the evolution of market integration""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Regime-switching behavior of the term structure of forward markets,Elena Tchernykh,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5893339W,/authors/OL1453634A/Elena_Tchernykh,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper presents techniques for modelling and estimating the behavior of financial market price or return differentials that follow non-linear regime-switching behaviour.  The methodology to be used here is estimation of variants of threshold autoregression (TAR) models.  In the basic model the differentials are random within a band defined by transactions costs and contract risk; they occasionally jump outside the band, and then follow an autoregressive path back towards the band.  The principal reference is Tchernykh (1998).  The application here is to deviations from covered interest parity (CIP) between forward foreign exchange (FX) markets in Hong Kong and the Philippines.  We have observed that these deviations from the band follow irregular steps, rather than single jumps.  Therefore a Modified TAR model (MTAR) that allows for this behaviour is also estimated.  The estimation methodology is a regime-switching maximum likelihood procedure.  The estimates can provide indicators for policy-makers of the market's expectation of crisis, and could also provide indicators for the private sector of convergence of deviations to their usual bands.  The TAR model has the potential to be applied to differentials between linked pairs of financial market prices more generally""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

These include in particular, analysis of quantitative indicators of financial system soundness and stability, including stress testing. These indicators strive to cover the issue of financial stability as a systemic phenomenon and therefore concern, not only financial institutions and markets, but also the real and government sectors as the main debtors of financial institutions, as well as the financial infrastructure. The inclusion of non-banking sector indicators in the financial stability indicators (FSIs) reflects the interconnectivity of the financial and real sectors, such as for example, unfavourable developments in the corporate sector pass-through to the loan portfolio of banks, thus having possibly a negative effect on financial stability.The objective of this study is to assess and review the array of financial stability indicators employed by the SEACEN member central banks as well as the strength and the shortcomings of the available tools, especially in the context of the recent global financial crisis. It also assessed the comparability and consistency of the FSI indicators across the SEACEN economies as well as globally since the objective of a set of financial stability indicators is to provide users with a general idea of the soundness of the financial sector as a whole. Lastly, the study also examined the recent efforts undertaken to further enhance these indicators both globally and also at the SEACEN member central banks, especially in the wake of the recent global financial crisis.

When, historically, there were no financial institutions such as banks, lotteries constituted the ways by which expensive items were disposed of, and governments raised money quickly. Gambling tables fulfilled roles that venture capital and banking do today. ""Gamblers"" created clearinghouses and sustained liquidity. When those gamblers bet on price distributions in futures markets, they were redefined as ""speculators"". Today they are called ""hedge fund managers"" or ""bankers"". Though the names have changed, the actions undertaken have essentially stayed the same. This book shows how discussion on ""chance"", ""risk"", ""gambling"", ""insurance"", and ""speculation"" illuminates where societies stood, where we are today, and where we may be heading.

The book shuns stochastic calculus in favor of cash flow details of arbitrage trades. All math is simple, but there is lots of it. The book reflects the relative value mentality of an institutional trader seeking profit from misalignments of various market segments.   The book is aimed at entrants into investment banking and dealing businesses, existing personnel in non-trading jobs, and people outside of the financial services industry trying to gain a view into what drives dealers in today's highly integrated marketplace.

PES programs use market and institutional incentives in order to meet both environmental and poverty alleviation objectives. However, their optimal design, implications for the rural poor, and how these initiatives integrate into international treaties on global warming and biodiversity loss are still being discussed. This book addresses these issues by examining analytical tools, providing policy insights and stimulating debate on linkages between poverty alleviation and environmental protection. In particular, it turns attention towards the role of environmental services in agricultural landscapes as they provide a living for many poor in developing countries.--Publisher's description.

The probability of large decreases in ownership is strongly increasing in contemporaneous and past stock returns but the probability of large increases in ownership through managerial purchases of shares is not. The relation between changes in Tobin's q and past and contemporaneous changes in ownership depends critically on controlling for past stock returns. When controlling for past stock returns, past large decreases in managerial ownership are unrelated to current changes in Tobin's q but there is some evidence that past large increases in managerial ownership are positively related to current changes in Tobin's q. Because managers sell shares when a firm's stock is performing well, large contemporaneous decreases in managerial ownership are associated with increases in Tobin's q. We argue that our evidence is mostly inconsistent with existing theories and propose a managerial discretion theory of ownership consistent with our evidence.

Après avoir édité les registres couvrant les périodes 1259-1373, R. Anthony Lodge achève ici la publication d'une comptabilité consulaire exceptionnelle en éditant le dernier des registres rédigés en occitan d'Auvergne (1378-1385), avant que ces écrits administratifs n'adoptent la langue royale. Ce volume est, de ce point de vue, capital pour comprendre les conditions de ce basculement idiomatique. La portée de cet ouvrage est double : il ouvre, dans la lignée des tomes précédents, des aperçus historiques indispensables à la compréhension de la vie et de la fiscalité urbaine au bas Moyen Âge et constitue par ailleurs une source de l'histoire de la langue occitane, tant pour sa variation que pour l'étude des contacts entre français et occitan. Ces comptes sont ainsi une mine pour les philologues et occitanistes, et offrent un matériau inédit pour les historiens de l'Auvergne.""--Page 4 of cover.

That's a bold claim, given there are already thousands of finance books on the shelves. So what makes this one different? Well, you won't be overwhelmed with a bunch of tips or a strict budget (that you won't follow). You'll get a step-by-step formula: open this account, then do this; call this person, and say this; invest money here, and not there. All with a glass of wine in your hand. This book will show you how to create an entire financial plan that is so simple you can sketch it on the back of a serviette and you'll be able to manage your money in 10 minutes a week. You'll also get the skinny on: saving up a six-figure house deposit in 20 months; doubling your income using the ""Trapeze Strategy""; saving 78,173 on your mortgage and wiping out 7 years of payments; finding a financial advisor who won't rip you off; handing your kids (or grandkids) a 140,000 cheque on their 21st birthday; why you don't need 1 million to retire with the ""Donald Bradman Retirement Strategy."" Sound too good to be true? It's not. This book is full of stories from everyday Aussie, single people, young families, empty nesters, and retirees who have applied the simple steps in this book and achieved amazing, life-changing results.

But the American financial system has repeatedly shown itself to be more resilient than such assessments suggest. This book argues that there is considerable coherence to American finance: far from being a house of cards, it is a proper edifice, built on institutional foundations with points of both strength and weakness. The book examines these foundations through a historical account of their construction: it shows how institutional transformations in the late nineteenth century created a distinctive infrastructure of financial relations and proceeds to trace the contradiction-ridden expansion of this system during the twentieth century as well as its institutional consolidation during the neoliberal era. It concludes with a discussion of the forces of instability that hit at the start of the twenty-first century""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Going inside trading centers in Hong Kong and Chongqing, China, as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Ferguson explains why once-risky markets in Asia, Latin America, and eastern Europe have become better investments than the U.K. or U.S. stock market.""--Container.

An introduction to exotic option pricing,Peter Buchen,finance,First published in 2012,/works/OL16343120W,/authors/OL7049299A/Peter_Buchen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Chapman and Hall/CRC|Language English,"""In an easy-to-understand, nontechnical yet mathematically elegant manner, An Introduction to Exotic Option Pricing shows how to price exotic options, including complex ones, without performing complicated integrations or formally solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The author incorporates much of his own unpublished work, including ideas and techniques new to the general quantitative finance community.The first part of the text presents the necessary financial, mathematical, and statistical background, covering both standard and specialized topics. Using no-arbitrage concepts, the Black-Scholes model, and the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, the author develops such specialized methods as the principle of static replication, the Gaussian shift theorem, and the method of images. A key feature is the application of the Gaussian shift theorem and its multivariate extension to price exotic options without needing a single integration.The second part focuses on applications to exotic option pricing, including dual-expiry, multi-asset rainbow, barrier, lookback, and Asian options. Pushing Black-Scholes option pricing to its limits, the author introduces a powerful formula for pricing a class of multi-asset, multiperiod derivatives. He gives full details of the calculations involved in pricing all of the exotic options.Taking an applied mathematics approach, this book illustrates how to use straightforward techniques to price a wide range of exotic options within the Black-Scholes framework. These methods can even be used as control variates in a Monte Carlo simulation of a stochastic volatility model""--  ""Preface This book is a collection of a large amount of material developed from my teaching, research, and supervision of student projects and PhD theses. It also contains a significant quantity of original unpublished work. One of my main interests in Financial Mathematics was to seek elegant methods for pricing derivative securities. Although the literature on derivatives is vast, virtually none outside the academic journals, concentrates solely on pricing methods. Where it is considered, details are often glossed over, with comments like: ""ʺ ʺ ʺ and after a length integration, we arrive at the result"", or ""ʺ ʺ ʺ this partial differential equation can be solved to yield the answer"". In my experience, many students, even the mathematically gifted ones, found the subject of pricing any but the simplest derivatives, somewhat unsatisfactory and often quite daunting. One aim of this book is to correct the impression that exotic option pricing is a subject only for the technophiles. My plan is to present it in a mathematically elegant and easily understood fashion. To this end: I show in this book how to price, in a Black-Scholes economy, the standard exotic options, and a host of non-standard ones as well, without generally performing a single integration, or formally solving a partial differential equation. How is this to be achieved? In a nutshell, the book devotes a lot of space to developing specialized methods based on no-arbitrage concepts, the Black- Scholes model and the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing. These include the Principal of Static Replication, the Gaussian Shift Theorem and the Method of Images. The last of these, which has been borrowed from Theoretical Physics, is ideally suited to pricing barrier and lookback options""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As he did with the issue of gun control in his thoughtful and succinct #1 bestseller Control, Glenn Beck uncovers the politically motivated truth behind the continual failures of the American educational system and offers real, tangible solutions for change. The debate over education--who decides what and how our children learn as they prepare for their futures--may be centuries old, but with issues like Common Core, homeschooling, charter schools, and teachers' unions affecting families nationwide, the debates rage hotter than ever. Going point by point with this well-reasoned, fact-based analysis, Glenn Beck proves that it's not more money our schools need--it's a complete refocusing of priorities and a total restructuring of the relationship between local schools and our federal government. For the sake of our children's schooling today and for their successes tomorrow, you must read Conform to fight for a system that offers nothing less than the world's highest-quality education. An essential handbook for anyone concerned about the precarious state of schools in our country today, Conform is for education what #1 New York Times bestseller Control was for gun rights""--  ""#1 bestselling author and popular radio and television host Glenn Beck considers the hot-button issue of education in the US, exposing the weaknesses of the Common Core school curriculum and examining why liberal solutions fail""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

NIDRR's mission is to generate new knowledge and promote its effective use in improving the ability of persons with disabilities to perform activities of their choice in the community, as well as to expand society's capacity to provide full opportunities and accommodations for its citizens with disabilities. NIDRR prides itself on being proactive in establishing program performance measures and developing accountability data systems to track the progress of its grantees. An electronic annual reporting system is used to collect data from grantees on many aspects of grant operation and outputs. Various formative and summative evaluation approaches have been used to assess the quality of the performance and results of the agency's research portfolio and its grantees. Prompted by the need to provide more data on its program results, in 2009 NIDRR requested that the National Research Council (NRC) conduct an external evaluation of some of the agency's key processes and assess the quality of outputs produced by NIDRR grantees (National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, 2009a).

No one has delved into the issue of school financing with such depth, data and thoughtful analysis. It is simply the best in the field.' Susan B. Neuman, University of Michigan Pointing to the disparities between wealthy and impoverished school districts in areas where revenue depends primarily upon local taxes, reformers repeatedly call for the centralization of school funding. Their proposals meet resistance from citizens, elected officials, and school administrators who fear the loss of local autonomy. Bryan Shelly finds, however, that local autonomy has already been compromised by federal and state governments, which exercise a tremendous amount of control over public education despite their small contribution to a school systems funding. This disproportionate relationship between funding and control allows state and federal officials to pass education policy yet excuses them from supplying adequate funding for new programs. The resulting unfunded and underfunded mandates and regulations, Shelly insists, are the true cause of the loss of community control over public education. He demonstrates the effects of the most infamous of underfunded federal mandates, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), and explores why schools implemented it despite its unpopularity and out-of-pocket costs. Shellys findings hold significant implications for school finance reform, NCLB, and the future of intergovernmental relations.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The paper assesses two channels through which legal origin may influence the financial system.  It finds that the adaptability of a country's legal system is more important for explaining the obstacles that firms face in accessing external finance than the political independence of the judiciary""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

For the novice to the experienced investor, it takes the mystery out of the intimidating world of investments and the stock market. Using food analogies, the book describes stocks, bonds, and preferred shares, among others, and how to invest in them. Why the food analogy? Similarly to having a well-balanced meal, an investor should have a well-balanced portfolio. So bonds are equated with potatoes, blue chip stocks with meat, and speculative stocks with dessert. The Portfolio Chef describes and explains the various types of investments available and then explains how to choose the ones suitable for each individual. With a majority of adults earning or inheriting higher levels of assets, this book is a must-read to become a well-informed investor. Most publications forget that everyone begins as a novice, but The Portfolio Chef does not. Even for the experienced investor, this book is a tool to help the reader better understand the importance of having a suitable asset mix and risk exposure. As statistics show, the population has an active interest in investing. With the burgeoning popularity of the Internet and its role in increasing the accessibility of information, more people are able to provide their own services in a way that would not have been possible a decade ago. The Portfolio Chef is tailor-made to reach the people who are comfortable researching for themselves, but haven't yet found the appropriate resources. It delivers powerful knowledge in a way that is easy to digest.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Make the SMART Choices, Steven Silbiger, CPA, offers a short guide to the big issues of retirement planning -- packed on every page with detailed, step-by-step advice. Choosing when to retire is one of the most important -- and overlooked -- decisions we will make about our lives.  Silbiger, author of The Ten-Day MBA, has written the first guide that untangles the complicated issues surrounding early retirement, based on careful research about the money pitfalls retirees and near-retirees face. He delivers an understandable roadmap that demystifies the confusion about Social Security benefits, and clarifies the choices for anyone considering when and how to retire.Are you thinking about getting the early Social Security check? It can be tempting, but for many this can be a foolhardy decision.  For others, it makes perfect sense. Making the smart choice about when to retire can make a $100,000 difference for an individual and $200,000 for a couple.  Silbiger guides readers through the key variables that affect the decision to elect early Social Security retirement benefits:  What are your early benefits and penalties? How's your health? Are you married? Are you planning on working while retired? What are your cash needs during retirement?  By getting a grip on how to manage our investments, cash flow, and real estate, Silbiger shows how we can put thousands of dollars more into our pockets every year. He addresses vital questions about money and retirement that include:  Tapping your nest egg for retirement -- how to make ends meet? Which retirement investments are for you? Are you prepared to fend off scam artists?  Through it all, you'll meet everyday people who have faced the early retirement question and learned how to make the smart choices.  Silbiger provides the tools, worksheets, and assessments to avoid costly mistakes, take charge of your financial future, and choose the path to a secure, happy retirement.

Is the Rapture really just around the corner? Could Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson possibly be right? About 1 billion people among us believe, yes, absolutely.And that means one thing: investment opportunities!For those who are not as expertly versed in the Book of Revelation, Ellis Weiner and Barbara Davilman, authors of the bestselling Yiddish with Dick and Jane, helpfully offer both illumination and advice: What exactly is the Rapture, anyway? How is it different from the Tribulation? Who are the Antichrist, the Four Horsemen, and the 144,000 male virgins, and what do they want? And, most important, how can I make money during the 7 years of societal breakdown before Armaggedon? Taking the familiar form of a how-to investment guide, HOW TO PROFIT FROM THE COMING RAPTURE instructs those readers who will certainly be left behind (Jews, Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, less ardent Protestants, and many more) on how to exploit the inevitable demise of the world in order to make a tidy profit. Sure, the rivers and seas will run with blood, locusts will swarm, mountains will move all over the place, and famine will strike. But for the five billion of us left behind, the post-Rapture world will be a time of even more unique investment opportunities.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Identifying inflation's grease and sand effects in the labor market,Erica L.

This paper investigates whether these two effects can be distinguished from each other in a labor market by the following identification strategy: inflation-induced deviations among employer's mean wage-changes represent unintended intramarket distortions (sand), while inflation-induced, inter-occupational wage-changes reflect intended alignments with intermarket forces (grease).  Using a unique 40-year panel of wage changes made by large mid-western employers, we find a wide variety of evidence to support the identification strategy.  We also find some indications that occupational wages in large firms gained flexibility in the past four years.  These results strongly support other findings that grease and sand effects exist, but also suggest that they offset each other in a welfare sense and in unemployment effects.  Thus, at levels up to five percent, the net impact of inflation is beneficial but statistically indistinguishable from zero.  It turns detrimental after that.  When positive, net benefits never exceed a tenth of gross benefits""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this paper, we analyze shareholders as agents that can both harm and benefit companies. We examine the ownership structure of 826 listed corporations and find that government shareholding is surprisingly large. Its effect on corporate value is found to be negative, but non-monotonic. Up to a certain threshold, corporate value decreases as government shareholding stakes increase, but beyond this corporate value begins to increase. We interpret this in terms of ownership concentration and the advantages of government partiality""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

Das Buch ist eigenständig nutzbar, aber auch eine ideale Ergänzung zu dem Lehrbuch ""Einführung in die angewandte Wirtschaftsmathematik"" des Autors. Es ist eine wichtige Lernhilfe, die die Examensvorbereitungen unterstützt, für Hörerinnen und Hörer der Grundvorlesungen in Wirtschaftsmathematik und zum Selbststudium gut geeignet. Die Aufgaben (erster Teil des Übungsbuches) stammen im wesentlichen aus dem Lehrbuch ""Einführung in die angewandte Wirtschaftsmathematik"". Der zweite Teil des Übungsbuches enthält die Lösungen der Aufgaben, er dient also als ""Lösungsbuch"" für das Lehrbuch. Wie das Lehrbuch, so sind auch die Lösungen der Aufgaben didaktisch geschickt gestaltet: Die Lösungshinweise sind im allgemeinen knapp gehalten, damit der erst durch intensive Beschäftigung mit den Problemstellungen erreichbare Lern-und Übungseffekt ermöglicht wird. Bei komplexen Aufgaben oder ökonomischen Interpretationen wurden die Hinweise und Erklärungen ausführlicher gestaltet.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Do workers' remittances promote financial development ?,Reena Aggarwal,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL24060979W,/authors/OL1386694A/Reena_Aggarwal,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  World Bank|Language English,"""Workers' remittances to developing countries have become the second largest type of flows after foreign direct investment.  The authors use data on workers' remittance flows to 99 developing countries from 1975-2003 to study the impact of remittances on financial sector development.  In particular, they examine whether remittances contribute to increasing the aggregate level of deposits and credit intermediated by the local banking sector.  This is an important question considering the extensive literature that has documented the growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing effects of financial development.  The findings provide strong support for the notion that remittances promote financial development in developing countries. ""--World Bank web site.

A double coincidence problem makes Fiat Money necessary as a medium of exchange. In the long-run, a rise in the rate of money growth leads to higher inflation and higher unemployment, so the long-run Phillips curve is not vertical. The optimal monetary growth rate decreases with the workers' bargaining power, the level of unemployment benefits and the payroll tax rate""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

The incidence of inflation,Leslie McGranahan,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL24060890W,/authors/OL5024007A/Leslie_McGranahan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|Language English,"""We use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1980-2003 combined with item specific Consumer Price Index data to calculate monthly chain- weighted inflation measures for thirteen different demographic groups and for the overall urban population from 1981-2004. We find that the inflation experiences of the different groups are very highly correlated with and similar in magnitude to the inflation experiences of the overall urban population. Over the sample period, cumulative inflation for the groups ranged from 224% to 242% as compared to inflation for the overall population of 230%. The group with the largest deviation from overall inflation consists of households where the head or spouse is 65 or over. These households had cumulative inflation 5% higher than the average. We also find that the variability of inflation is higher for vulnerable populations and lower for advantaged populations. In particular, we calculate that the standard deviation of inflation declines with educational attainment. This is the result of higher expenditure shares among the less educated on necessities with more variable prices, including food and energy. However, this difference in variability is fairly modest. The inflation rate of the least educated is 3.0% more variable than inflation for all urban households. We conclude that inflation is principally an aggregate shock and that the CPI-U does a reasonable job of measuring the inflation experience of the demographic groups that we investigate""--Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago web site.

Holding these (and other) factors constant, we find immigrants from countries with more effective institutions are more likely to have a relationship with a bank and use formal financial markets more extensively.  Institutional quality appears to be an important factor in both determining both the breadth and the depth of financial access.  It can explain approximately 17 percent of the country-of- origin-level variation in bank account usage among immigrants in the U.S., after other characteristics, including wealth, education and income, are controlled for.  Institutional quality is even more important for explaining more extensive participation in financial markets, accounting for 27 percent of the analogous variation.  We examine various measures of institutional effectiveness and are careful to control for unobserved individual characteristics, including specifications with country fixed-effects""--Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago web site.

The results suggest that it is difficult to establish a robust causal relationship between financial integration and economic growth.  Furthermore, there is little evidence that developing countries have been consistently successful in using financial integration to stabilize fluctuations in consumption growth.  However, we do find that financial globalization can be beneficial under the right circumstances.  Empirically, good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization.  Similarly, macroeconomic stability appears to be an important prerequisite for ensuring that financial globalization is beneficial for developing countries.  Finally, countries that employ relatively flexible exchange rate regimes and succeed in maintaining fiscal discipline are more likely to enjoy the potential growth and stabilization benefits of financial globalization""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Financial development-as captured by size, depth, efficiency, and reach of financial systems-varies sharply around the world, with large differences among countries at similar levels of income.  This paper argues that governments play an important role in building effective financial systems and discusses different policy options to make finance work for development.

Financing firms in India,Franklin Allen,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL24060973W,/authors/OL723888A/Franklin_Allen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  World Bank|Language English,"""The authors examine the legal and business environments, financing channels, and governance mechanisms of various types of firms in India and compare them to those from other countries.  Despite its English commonlaw origin, strong legal protection provided by the law, and a democratic government, corruption within India's legal system and government significantly weakens investor protection in practice.  External financing of firms has been dominated by nonmarket sources of financing, while the characteristics of listed firms are similar to those from countries with weak investor protection.  The evidence, including results based on a survey of small and medium-scale private firms, shows that alternative financing channels provide the most important source of funds.  The authors also find that informal governance mechanisms, such as those based on reputation, trust, and relationships are more important than formal mechanisms (such as courts) in resolving disputes, overcoming corruption, and supporting growth.

Access to finance by Chilean corporations,Sophie Sirtaine,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL23958538W,/authors/OL3625845A/Sophie_Sirtaine,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  World Bank|Language English,"""The author assesses the extent to which Chilean firms have access to sufficient and adequate sources of funds.  Access to finance has become an important issue for policymakers in Latin America.  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in particular, complain that their lack of access to adequate sources of financing is an obstacle to their growth.  Chile represents an interesting case study since it has one of the most developed financial markets in the continent, and thus great potential for using products suited to the needs and risk characteristics of SMEs.  The author concludes that the largest firms have access to the whole range of financial instruments available in Chile.  All smaller firms face financing constraints.  She then analyzes the obstacles to downsizing access to the capital market and further increasing the penetration of banks in smaller segments. ""--World Bank web site.
