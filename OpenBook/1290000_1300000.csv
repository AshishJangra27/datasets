Written in eloquent, accessible prose and illustrated in magnificent color throughout, including images from innovative simulations of the evolving universe, this book brings the new scientific picture of the universe to life. It interprets what our human place in the cosmos may mean for us and our descendants. It offers unique insights into the potential use of this newfound knowledge to find solutions to seemingly intractable global problems such as climate change and unsustainable growth. And it explains why we need to ""think cosmically, act globally"" if we're going to have a long-term, prosperous future on Earth""--  ""Most people assume either that Earth was created as-is a few thousand years ago, or else that it's a lonely rock in endless space--although both assumptions are wrong. Meanwhile, global problems like climate destabilization, economic chaos, religious-justified violence, and exhaustion of planetary resources are escalating. These facts are connected. The new universe picture described in this book provides a believable new origin story and cosmic context, which help us to think for the first time on large enough time and size scales to see how to keep Earth and the human species healthy long into the future""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The bestsellers tell the story of a regular girl's relationship with a vampire who has chosen to follow his ""good"" side. But the Saga isn't just another fantasy--it's teaching girls about love, sex, and purpose. With 48 million copies in print and a succession of upcoming blockbuster films, now is the time to ask the important question: Can vampires teach us about God's plan for love?Touched by a Vampire is the first book to investigate the themes of the Twilight Saga from a Biblical perspective. Some Christian readers have praised moral principles illustrated in the story, such as premarital sexual abstinence, which align with Meyer's Mormon beliefs. But ultimately, Beth Felker Jones examines whether the story's redemptive qualities outshine its darkness.Cautionary, thoughtful, and challenging, Touched by a Vampire is written for Twilight fans, parents, teachers, and pop culture enthusiasts. It includes an overview of the series for those unfamiliar with the storyline and a discussion guide for small groups.From the Trade Paperback edition.

The Conversion of Missionaries,Lian Xi,religion,First published in 1996,/works/OL3253329W?edition=ia%3Aconversionofmiss0000unse,/authors/OL529906A/Lian_Xi,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL972931M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Pennsylvania State University Press|Language English|Pages 247,"Like many of her fellow missionaries to China, Pearl Buck found that she was not immune to the influence of her adopted home. In this book Lian Xi tells the story of Buck and two other American missionaries to China in the early twentieth century who gradually came to question, and eventually reject, the evangelical basis of Protestant missions as they developed an appreciation for Chinese religions and culture. Lian Xi uses these stories as windows to understanding the development of a broad theological and cultural liberalism within American Protestant missions.    The rise of missions in nineteenth-century America was an overflow of America's religious and nationalist spirit. The development of liberalism in the mission field in the twentieth century, however, precipitated a major crisis within the American missionary enterprise. It also generated what Lian Xi calls a ""reverse missionary impulse"" as the liberal missionaries transmitted their own theological and cultural insights to their religious base at home. This development, he argues, became one of the chief ironies in the American Protestant efforts to penetrate and convert China. The untraditional, and often syncretic, religious and cultural views that emerged out of the missionaries' experience in the East enriched Protestant thought in America and contributed to the Modernist search for a broadened interpretation of Christianity.

Describes the five sacred sites of the Huichol and their peyote ceremonies . Explains how the Huichol teachings of awareness, centered on the five points of attention, connect you to your true essence. Reveals the deep relationship between Huichol cosmology, Gnosticism, and Christianity, especially Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. Taking place in the heart of the Huichol homeland in western Mexico, this book offers a rare in-depth look at the inner workings of Huichol shamanism, which is permeated with the use of the sacred peyote cactus. Outsiders are almost never allowed access to Huichol sacred sites and ceremonies; however, James Endredy, after years of friendship with Huichol families, earned the privilege nearly by accident. Swayed by persistent pleading, he agreed to take another gringo into the mountains to one of the Huichols' ceremonial centers, and they were both caught. After trial and punishment, Endredy was invited to stay within the sacred lands for the festivities he had illegally intruded upon and found his initiation into the Huichol shamanic tradition had begun. Sharing his intimate conversations and journeys with the shaman he calls ""Peyote Jesus,"" the author explains how Huichol belief revolves around the five sacred directions, the five sacred sites, and the five points of attention. As Peyote Jesus explains, the five points of attention refer to dividing your awareness yet staying focused on your inner self. This is not a normal state of consciousness for most people, yet when we maintain these points of attention, we discover our true essence and move closer to God. Endredy undergoes dozens of spiritual journeys with peyote as he makes the pilgrimages to the five sacred Huichol sites with Peyote Jesus. He is shocked by his vision of the Virgin Mary while under peyote's guidance and learns of the deep relationship--strictly on Huichol terms--between their cosmology, Gnosticism, and Christianity, especially Jesus Christ. Providing an inside look at the major ceremonies and peyote rituals of the Huichol, this unexpectedly powerful book reveals the key tenants of the Huichol worldview, their beliefs in the afterlife, and their spiritual work on behalf of all of humanity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

According to recent opinion polls and election returns, Americans are deeply concerned about the quality of life in this country. While liberals want big government to solve social problems like violent crime, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, and welfare dependency, conservatives believe local authorities, especially churches, are the only ones who can bring values and wholesome prosperity back to American life. But, argues historian Thomas Reeves, if we expect churches to improve our communities, we must first address a more pressing question: Do churches really matter anymore? In this alarming expose of America's mainline Protestant churches, historian Thomas C. Reeves asserts that these once hallowed houses of worship do not matter nearly so much as they used to, and that, in fact, they are consistently unappealing and irrelevant. - Jacket flap.

'God did not make us Negroes,' declared religious leaders in black communities of the early twentieth-century urban North. They insisted that so-called Negroes are, in reality, Ethiopian Hebrews, Asiatic Muslims, or raceless children of God. Rejecting conventional American racial classification, many black southern migrants and immigrants from the Caribbean embraced these alternative visions of black history, racial identity, and collective future, thereby reshaping the black religious and racial landscape. Focusing on the Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, Father Divine's Peace Mission Movement, and a number of congregations of Ethiopian Hebrews, Judith Weisenfeld argues that the appeal of these groups lay not only in the new religious opportunities membership provided, but also in the novel ways they formulated a religio-racial identity. Arguing that members of these groups understood their religious and racial identities as divinely-ordained and inseparable, the book examines how this sense of self shaped their conceptions of their bodies, families, religious and social communities, space and place, and political sensibilities. Weisenfeld draws on extensive archival research and incorporates a rich array of sources to highlight the experiences of average members. The book demonstrates that the efforts by members of these movements to contest conventional racial categorization contributed to broader discussions in black America about the nature of racial identity and the collective future of black people that still resonate today""--Publisher's description.

Meeks (Religion, Yale) has organized and analyzed a vast amount of scholarly material here, and no advanced student of the New Testament can ignore his work. But the sad fact is that Paul's letters, even when read in the light of contemporary Jewish and pagan sources, really don't tell us much about the first Christian communities, and so the non-specialist reader will likely find Meeks' book, despite its richness, paradoxically thin. Thus, Meeks begins by establishing that Pauline Christianity grew up in a band of cities (ranging in size from the very small Philippi to the very large Ephesus and Corinth) that stretched from central Asia Minor westward to Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, among a population that was linguistically Greek but politically Roman. This raise en scÃ¨ne is marvelously detailed, but reaches no radically new conclusions. Meeks then goes to great length to argue that """"a Pauline congregation generally reflected a fair cross-section of urban society"""" (by and large skipping the highest and lowest levels). His case is carefully made, but seems to have no earthshaking import--except for Marxists and others who maintain that Christianity had its roots in the proletariat. Similarly, Meeks surveys the formation of the ekklesia and its governance, early Christian ritual, and finally """"patterns of belief and patterns of life."""" Here again he offers a masterful review of current scholarship, but his broad theoretical insights are necessarily little more than guesses. (E.g., judging from some 30 people mentioned in the Epistles, Meeks speculates that they suffered from """"high status inconsistency"""" and hence might well lend a willing ear to the apocalyptic-eschatological element in Paul's message.) Still, within the limits imposed by the sketchiness of the evidence, a fine performance.   Read more Read less",12 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

The cycle?s deft handling of moral ambiguity and inventive technique established Kie?lowski as a major international director. Kie?lowski once said, ?Both the deep believer and the habitual skeptic experience toothaches in exactly the same way.? Of Elephants and Toothaches takes seriously the range of thought, from theological to skeptical, condensed in the cycle?s quite human tales. Bringing together scholars of film, philosophy, literature, and several religions, the volume ranges from individual responsibility, to religion in modernity, to familial bonds, to human desire and material greed. It explores Kie?lowski?s cycle as it relentlessly solicits an ethical response that stimulates both inner disquiet and interpersonal dialogue.

James interprets Kaufman's mature position as a sophisticated reconstruction of divine activity that makes use of recent scientific theory and its naturalistic assumptions in order to revitalize a theocentric frame of reference rooted in classical theological tradition. Though there are costs to be paid in the construction of a theology of ""radical naturalism,"" particularly with respect to the relation between divine action and the human good, Kaufman's program offers a distinctive way forward. After developing a critical analysis of the limitations and possibilities of Kaufman's mature position, James suggests that a christological reconsideration of the meaning of human flourishing offers the prospect of an even more radically naturalistic and theocentric theology.""--Publisher.

This volume seeks to raise our awareness of what the notion implies and to test its use for the analysis of ancient religions. The papers range from Classical Greece, Hellenistic Babylon, Rome and the Etruscans, to Late Antiquity and the rise of Islam. They seek to determine how much can be gained in each individual case by understanding religious interaction in terms of rivalry and competition. In doing so, the volume hopes to open a more explicit debate on the analytical tools with which ancient religion is currently being studied.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Has modern science with its theory of evolution disproved the biblical account of the origin of life? If one accepts the biblical account of origins, does one then have to reject science? Scientist and Christian believer Ariel A. Roth argues that taken together, science and religion give us a more complete and sensible understanding of the world around us, our place in it, and our ultimate meaning and fate. Roth examines such topics as the evidence for evolution and creation, the Flood, the strengths and limitations of the scientific method, and the reliability of Scripture. He concludes that the biblical model of a recent creation by God leaves fewer unanswered questions then either science's evolutionary model or any view between the two positions, such as progressive creation or theistic evolution. - Back cover.

The scientific Buddha,"Lopez, Donald S.",religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16626968W?edition=ia%3Ascientificbuddha0000lope,/authors/OL399912A/Lopez_Donald_S.,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25307385M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Yale University Press|Language English,"""This book tells the story of the Scientific Buddha, ""born"" in Europe in the 1800s but commonly confused with the Buddha born in India 2,500 years ago. The Scientific Buddha was sent into battle against Christian missionaries, who were proclaiming across Asia that Buddhism was a form of superstition. He proved the missionaries wrong, teaching a dharma that was in harmony with modern science. And so his influence continues. Today his teaching of ""mindfulness"" is heralded as the cure for all manner of maladies, from depression to high blood pressure.In this potent critique, a well-known chronicler of the West's encounter with Buddhism demonstrates how the Scientific Buddha's teachings deviate in crucial ways from those of the far older Buddha of ancient India. Donald Lopez shows that the Western focus on the Scientific Buddha threatens to bleach Buddhism of its vibrancy, complexity, and power, even as the superficial focus on ""mindfulness"" turns Buddhism into merely the latest self-help movement. The Scientific Buddha has served his purpose, Lopez argues. It is now time for him to pass into nirvana. This is not to say, however, that the teachings of the ancient Buddha must be dismissed as mere cultural artifacts. They continue to present a meaningful challenge, even to our modern world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When I was a little girl, I had a dream. More than once. I would be standing in the yard of our tiny white bungalow looking up to see a huge bomb hanging over our house in mid-air. The bomb made me greatly afraid. Fleeting thoughts of the dream connected it to World War II, the Germans, the Nazis since The War was not forgotten, and the topic of an enemy was a familiar one. But this bomb was not about war or any external enemy. The dream symbolizes the emotional state of my family representing the sadness, the pain, the explosive words and actions, and the pervasive atmosphere of negativity, where real memories were buried beneath layers of imposed learning. Surfacing in my memory after several years of excavating the past through meditation, it represents a first step in remembering what my life was like as a child. The fear and hostility were deflected to those groups since it was much easier to look at obscure targets out there and blame them for the pain and sadness than to look within and accept responsibility for our actions and see what needed to be changed. My family was not obviously troubled or abusive. I believe most families do not look abusive until one has the opportunity to follow them home and live with them for six months and see the love that is present or the lack thereof. Mine was simply not a loving family. This is the story I never intended to write. It is a love story. It is about finding God. It has little to do with organized religion. My journey to love came through a personal searching. A searching within. My searching began with a desire to know how to love my children. I learned through the searching that I could find the truth. You mean, that is all it took? A tiny glimmer? Just a hint about wanting to love my children?""

"Ascent of the Mountain, Flight of the Dove",,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL32327778W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""The essence of Ascent of the Mountain, Flight of the Dove remains intact: its vision of religious studies as sustained refl ection on our lifelong voyage to discover who we are. The story we choose for ourselves, the story we live, can sacralize or secularize our lives and our world by the way in which we choose to relate to it. With this awareness of the story dimension of life, Ascent of the Mountain, Flight of the Dove opens us to awe, reverence, and wonder at the risks and possibilities of human freedom. This book is even more important than it was thirty years ago. We need religion to strike deeply into the self, away from public glare. Unless Americans become more sophisticated about the language of the self, inner life will shrivel. In addition, our people will continue to be vulnerable to fundamentalist movements. Such movements take over too many innocents. Th ey promise, and sometimes deliver, a touching happiness. But they do so by closing the spirit in a powerful and dangerous way. Families and schools do not provide a large and critical vocabulary by which to express the inner longings of the spirit. The souls of many are parched and they gladly accept water, any water, from those who off er it. Th e liberation of the religious spirit from trivial, closed, and simplistic systems of thought can only be achieved through the development of a critical language, exercises, and disciplines that open rather than close the mind, that lead to higher viewpoints, breakthroughs, and new syntheses, in a constant enlargement of spirit. Novak's book leads us to that place.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Islam and the making of the nation,Chiara Formichi,religion,,/works/OL20933666W,/authors/OL7897663A/Chiara_Formichi,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Brill|Language English|Pages 244,"For decades, scholars of Indonesia have rejected the religious claims of the Darul Islam movement, interpreting the antagonism between the Islamic state and Soekarno?s republic as a fight for power, self-assertion, or land rights. Recently Kartosuwiryo and the Darul Islam have become heroic symbols of the local Islamist struggle, offering an alternative vision of this politician. The author looks beyond this dichotomy between rebel and martyr to unveil a ?third? dimension of Kartosuwiryo?a politician whose legacy has been shaping the role of Islam in Indonesian politics for over fifty years.     In a blend of archival sources, printed material, and oral accounts, the author follows the career and ideology of Kartosuwiryo, nationalist leader of the Sarekat Islam party and later Imam of the Islamic State of Indonesia. Following the trajectory of a political activism that was consistently dedicated to the formation of an independent Indonesian state, the chapters delineate the gradual radicalization of the Islamic party and of Kartosuwiryo?s own ideals from the 1920s until the 1950s.     Focusing on the dialectic between the religious and secular anti-colonial movements, this book explores the failure of political Islam in the mid-1950s; the consolidation of the Pancasila state under Soekarno?s and Suharto?s regimes; the latter?s attempt to co-opt what was left of the Darul Islam in the 1970s; and the re-emergence of political Islam and Kartosuwiryo?s memory in the post-1998 era.    A testament to the relevance of historical enquiry in understanding contemporary politics, Islam and the making of the nation guides the reader through the contingencies of the past that have led to the transformation of a nationalist leader into a ?separatist rebel? and a ?martyr?, while at the same time shaping the public perception of political Islam and strengthening the position of the Pancasila in contemporary Indonesia.  Chiara Formichi (1982) has a PhD from the Department of History of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, in 2009, and she is Assistant Professor in Asian and International Studies at City University of Hong Kong.

Religion ? Violence? seek to improve our understanding of the relationship between religion, politics and violence. It therefore deals especially with the return of religious themes and symbols into politics, with the analysis of the link between political theory and religion, and finally with the critical discussion of the secularization thesis. At the centre of the research are questions concerning the causes of violent conflict, the possibilities for a just world order and the conditions for peaceful coexistence on a local, regional, national and international/worldwide scale between communities in the face of divergent religious and ideological convictions. Its task is to initiate and coordinate thematically related research-efforts from various disciplinary backgrounds at the University of Innsbruck. It creates a network between departments, research-teams and single researchers working on topics of religion, politics and violence. The overall aim of the research platform World Order-Religion-Violence is to promote excellence in social and human science research on religion and politics at the University of Innsbruck and to guarantee the diffusion of this particular competence on a national and international level.""

It therefore deals especially with the return of religious themes and symbols into politics, with the analysis of the link between political theory and religion, and finally with the critical discussion of the secularization thesis. At the centre of the research are questions concerning the causes of violent conflict, the possibilities for a just world order and the conditions for peaceful coexistence on a local, regional, national and international/worldwide scale between communities in the face of divergent religious and ideological convictions. Its task is to initiate and coordinate thematically related research-efforts from various disciplinary backgrounds at the University of Innsbruck. It creates a network between departments, research-teams and single researchers working on topics of religion, politics and violence. The overall aim of the research platform World Order-Religion-Violence is to promote excellence in social and human science research on religion and politics at the University of Innsbruck and to guarantee the diffusion of this particular competence on a national and international level.""  ""Die in diesem Buch versammelten Beiträge untersuchen die Religionspolitik der wichtigsten öffentlich anerkannten Religionsgemeinschaften in Österreich (Katholische, Evangelische und Orthodoxe Kirche, Jüdische Gemeinde und Islamische Glaubensgemeinschaft) sowie deren zivilgesellschaftliches und öffentliches Engagement.

Christianity, with its emphasis on humans made in the image of God, has a clear perspective. Psychology offers answers too, but they are often subtly implied. Drawn from more than fifty years of classroom experience, this introductory guide provides students with a coherent framework for considering psychology from a Christian perspective. The authors explore biblical themes of human nature in relation to all major areas of psychology, showing how a Christian understanding of humans can inform the study of psychology. Brief, accessible chapters correspond to standard introductory psychology textbooks, making this an excellent supplemental text. End-of-chapter questions are included.

This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts""--Provided by publishers.

This Very Short Introduction looks at the Devil in the history of ideas and in the lives of real people. Darren Oldridge shows us that the Devil is an important figure in western history--a richly complex and contradictory one. Oldridge focuses on three main themes: the idea of the Devil being integral to western thought from the early Middle Ages to the beginnings of modernity; the belief that the Devil represents the mirror image of goodness; and the multiplicity and instability of ideas about the Devil. Oldridge concludes by exploring ""demonological"" ways of thinking in our own time, including allegations of ""satanic ritual abuse.""""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this groundbreaking work, John H. Evans reveals that, with a few limited exceptions, even the most conservative religious Americans accept science?s ability to make factual claims about the world. However, many religious people take issue with the morality implicitly promoted by some forms of science. Using clear and engaging scholarship, Evans upends the prevailing notion that there is a fundamental conflict over the way that scientists and religious people make claims about nature and argues that only by properly understanding moral conflict between contemporary religion and science will we be able to contribute to a more productive interaction between these two great institutions.

Norton & Co.|Pages 276","Is religion a force for good or evil in world politics? How much influence does it have? Despite predictions of its decline, religion has resurged in political influence across the globe, helped by the very forces that were supposed to bury it: democracy, globalization, and technology. And despite recent claims that religion is exclusively irrational and violent, its political influence is in fact diverse, sometimes promoting civil war and terrorism but at other times fostering democracy, reconciliation, and peace. Looking across the globe, the authors explain what generates these radically divergent behaviors. In a time when the public discussion of religion is overheated, these dynamic young scholars use deeply original analysis and sharp case studies to show us both how and why religion’s influence on global politics is surging. Finally they offer concrete suggestions on how to both confront the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities posed by globally resurgent religion.

Since her mother's death, Naomi Esch has been devoted to caring for her father and siblings, sacrificing any hope of finding love or having a home of her own. Still, working at the local bakery and expanding her beekeeping business gives Naomi a satisfying sense of purpose. Then, in the weeks before Christmas, her father announces his plan to immediately remarry. He and his new wife need the house for themselves, and suddenly Naomi's life is turned upside down. But new opportunities soon come her way. Her youngest brother finds Naomi a place to stay, and widower Nathan King offers his sprawling farmland to Naomi to continue her business--on the condition that she care for his children. The setup is so perfect that the community assumes a wedding will inevitably follow. Yet Naomi has vowed never to marry without love. And to Nathan she's merely convenient help. Now, for the inhabitants of Pleasant Valley, uniting these two stubborn souls may take a Christmas miracle""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Timothy Leary would be the rebellious trickster, the premier proponent of the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of LSD, advising a generation to ""turn on, tune in, and drop out."" Richard Alpert would be the seeker, traveling to India and returning to America as Ram Dass, reborn as a spiritual leader with his ""Be Here Now"" mantra, inspiring a restless army of spiritual pilgrims. Huston Smith would be the teacher, practicing every world religion, introducing the Dalai Lama to the West, and educating generations of Americans to adopt a more tolerant, inclusive attitude toward other cultures' beliefs. And young Andrew Weil would be the healer, becoming the undisputed leader of alternative medicine, devoting his life to the holistic reformation of the American health care system.It was meant to be a time of joy, of peace, and of love, but behind the scenes lurked backstabbing, jealousy, and outright betrayal. In spite of their personal conflicts, the members of the Harvard Psychedelic Club would forever change the way Americans view religion and practice medicine, and the very way we look at body and soul.

And a full 92 percent of Americans prefer to believe in God or a universal spirit. But in Sacred Matters, Gary Laderman casts his eye over our deeply hidden spiritual landscape, questioning whether our conventional views even begin to capture the rich and strange diversity of religious life in America.  Sacred Matters shows that genuinely religious practices and experiences can be found in the unlikeliest of places -- in science laboratories and movie theaters, at the Super Bowl and Star Trek conventions, and in Americans' obsession with prescription drugs and pornography. When devoted fans make a pilgrimage to Graceland because of their love for Elvis, Laderman argues, their behavior doesn't just seem religious, it is religious -- enacting a well-known ritual pattern toward saints in the history of Christianity.  In a dramatic reframing of what is holy and secular, Sacred Matters makes a powerful and illuminating case that religion is everywhere -- and that we have barely begun to reckon with its hold on our cultural life.

Wie Religionen im Alten Orient, in der griechischen und agyptischen Antike, im Alten und Neuen Testament, im spatantiken Christentum und im Islam die Welt deuten, wird in dem vorliegenden Band im interdisziplinaren Gesprach erortert. Grundlegende Kategorien der Welterklarung sind Chaos und Kosmos, Schopfung und Weltende, himmlische und irdische Welt bzw. die Welt der Lebenden und die Unterwelt. In zehn Fallstudien fragen die Autoren nach der Topographie solcher Weltkonstruktionen, wobei sowohl die Unterschiede zwischen den Deutungsmustern der einzelnen Religionen als auch die Analogien zu Tage treten. Klar ist: Wer zwischen dem zweiten Jahrtausend vor und dem ersten Jahrtausend nach Christus nach der Welt und den in ihr waltenden Machten fragt, fragt auch nach der Macht Gottes - und damit nach Ziel und Sinn der Welt.

In the heart of the desert,John Chryssavgis,religion,First published in 2003,/works/OL917456W?edition=ia%3Ainheartofdeserts0000chry,/authors/OL80943A/John_Chryssavgis,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22559709M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  World Wisdom|Language English|Pages 163,"This book brings to readers the lives and thoughts of some key representatives of the early Desert Fathers and Mothers, who were so important in the history of the early Christian Church.Glimpses of their austere and holy lives and many of their important sayings are contained in this book by Fr. John Chryssavgis, former Professor of Theology and Dean at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology. The book also presents, for the first time in the English language, a translation of a fifth-century text, the Reflections (Dialogismoiv) of Abba Zosimas, one of the most significant later figures of the Desert Fathers and Mothers.The words of spiritual counsel, which form the heart of this book, are as clear and timeless as the desert stars on a winter night.  Not only do the sayings of the Desert Fathers possess the imprint of eternity, but the fresh and vital commentary by Father John Chryssavgis brings these ancient  words into sharp focus; it brings them fully to life and provides a key which unlocks their relevance for the reader of today.  This book is a well of wisdom from which anyone who finds himself in the desert of his own soul may drink freely from the water of life. The actual Egyptian desert to which these monks fled in the fourth and fifth centuries was, of course, an actual place.  But, the desert may also be understood as an inner geography of desolation and abandonment; it is the place, perhaps even in the midst of others, where we are most alone.  It is the valley of our deepest solitude.  Father John tells us that anyone who has experienced some aspect of deserted-ness, loneliness, brokenness, breakdown or break-up—whether emotionally, physically or socially—will connect with the profound humanity of the Desert Fathers and Mothers.  Various traditions from world religions teach that God enters into the empty soul. If in our prayers we long for His Presence and wait for Him with patience, confidence, humility and trust, then He will come into the center of our lives and establish there His kingdom.  The universal and perennial message of these first Christian monks concerns the necessity of emptiness; the Desert Fathers show us, by their examples, how to confront the chaotic impulses of the soul which drive us away from that still point where God is waiting. These are not only the demons confronted by Saint Anthony; they are the demons which must be confronted in the arena of the soul by every man who seeks to rise above himself for the sake of God.  In the Heart of the Desert also includes a foreword by Benedicta Ward, SLG, editor of the acclaimed collection Sayings of the Desert Fathers: The Alphabetical Collection, (Cistercian Publications: Kalamazoo, MI, 1975), and a noted expert in this fascinating area of Christian history and ageless wisdom.

Unexpectedly denied a visa to remain in the United States, Qanta Ahmed, a young British Muslim doctor, becomes an outcast in motion. On a whim, she accepts an exciting position in Saudi Arabia. This is not just a new job; this is a chance at adventure in an exotic land she thinks she understands, a place she hopes she will belong. What she discovers is vastly different. The Kingdom is a world apart, a land of unparralled contrast. She finds rejection and scorn in the places she believed would most embrace her, but also humor, honesty, loyalty and love. And for Qanta, more than anything, it is a land of opportunity. A place where she discovers what it takes for one woman to recreate herself in the land of invisible women.

Eerdmans Publishing Co.|Language English,"This book is the first close examination of how Robert E. Lee's faith shaped his life. Robert E. Lee was many things -- accomplished soldier, military engineer, college president, family man, agent of reconciliation, polarizing figure. He was also a person of deep Christian conviction. In this biography of the famous Civil War general, R. David Cox shows how Lee's Christian faith shaped his crucial role in some of the most pivotal events in American history. Delving into family letters and other primary sources -- some of them newly discovered -- Cox traces the lifelong development of Lee's convictions and how they influenced his decisions to stand with Virginia over against the Union and later to support reconciliation and reconstruction in the years after the Civil War. Faith was central to Lee's character, Cox argues -- so central that it directed and redirected his life, especially in the aftermath of defeat. - Publisher.  Robert E.

Fisher complicates the traditional scholarly narrative of the unification of Hinduism. By calling into question the colonial categories implicit in the term ?sectarianism,? Fisher?s work excavates the pluralistic textures of precolonial Hinduism in the centuries prior to British intervention. Drawing on previously unpublished sources in Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu, Fisher argues that the performance of plural religious identities in public space in Indian early modernity paved the way for the emergence of a distinctively non-Western form of religious pluralism. This work provides a critical resource for understanding how Hinduism developed in the early modern period, a crucial era that set the tenor for religion?s role in public life in India through the present day.

Yet until Denzey began her research for The Bone Gatherers, no one had ever drawn on this evidence to read into those women’s lives.The Bone Gatherers introduces us to these powerful women who, until recently, had been lost to history — from the sorrowing mothers and ghastly brides of pagan Rome to the child martyrs and women sponsors who shaped early Christianity. It was often only in death that ancient women became visible — through the buildings, burial sites, and art constructed in their memory — and Denzey uses this archaeological evidence, along with text records, to resurrect the lives of several fourth-century women.Surprisingly, she finds that representations of aristocratic Roman Christian women show a shift in the value and significance of womanhood over the fourth century: once esteemed as powerful leaders or patrons, women came to be revered only as virgins or martyrs — figureheads for sexual purity. These depictions belie a power struggle between the sexes within early Christianity — one that women lost, and one that has had long-lasting implications for the roles of women in the Church.

Thus the story of Klah told here is also the story of his prominent family and reflects nearly two hundred important years of Navaho history.  Klah’s great-grandfather, Narbona, was war chief of the Navahos during their heyday. His mother made the “Long Walk” to the Bosque Redondo (Fort Sumner). After Klah was born in 1867, one year before the treaty establishing the Navaho Reservation, his family moved back to their ancestral land and slowly regained their former wealth.  The most influential medicine man on the Reservation, Klah also became an expert weaver. Many of his sand-painting designs were woven on tapestries and so preserved, for he had no successor.  Franc Johnson Newcomb lived for twenty-five years on the Navajo Reservation at her husband's trading post, where Klah was their neighbor and friend. She wrote and lectured extensively on Navajo religion and symbolism and collected more than four hundred sand-painting sketches.  The Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art at Santa Fe has as it's nucleus Klah’s tapestries, ceremonial effects, and drawings of his sand paintings.

The principal theme is the slow drama of the building of a Christian civilization. A major theme is the mission of Christians among different peoples in many regions of the ancient world: Ethiopia, Nubia, Armenia, Georgia, Persia, central Asia, India, China as well as among the Germanic peoples of northern Europe and the Slavic peoples in the Balkans and Russia. The rise and spread of Islam is integral to the story. How did a community that was largely invisible in the first two centuries of its existence go on to remake the civilizations it inhabited, culturally, politically, and intellectually? Beginning with the life of Jesus, the author narrates the dramatic spread and development of Christianity over the first thousand years of its history. Moving through the formation of early institutions, practices, and beliefs to the transformations of the Roman world after the conversion of Constantine, he sheds new light on the subsequent stories of Christianity in the Latin West, the Byzantine and Slavic East, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Through a selected narration of particularly noteworthy persons and events, he demonstrates how the coming of Christianity set in motion one of the most profound revolutions the world has known. This is not a story limited to the West; rather, Christian communities in Ethiopia, Nubia, Armenia, Georgia, Persia, Central Asia, India, and China shaped the course of Christian history. The rise and spread of Islam had a lasting impact on the future of Christianity, and several chapters are devoted to the early experiences of Christians under Muslim rule. The author reminds us that the career of Christianity is characterized by decline and attrition as well as by growth and expansion. - Publisher.

God’s gifts are real—with confidence you can accept, unwrap, and release His good and perfect offerings into your life today.   In this second book in the Gifts of Freedom series, you will be immersed in the kindness, grace, and mercy of God as you examine:     Gift #5: Gold—God promises to provide for you.    Gift #6: Frankincense—God desires communication with you.    Gift #7: Myrrh—God conquered death for you.  Many seek freedom from financial worry, relationship stress, and the fear of death; author Greg Rice gives biblically sound answers to these and other life issues. Learning how to grant forgiveness for the past, embrace obedience for the present, and have faith for the future gives you the keys to open all of your God-given gifts, talents, skills, purpose, and destiny—today.Greg Rice has been involved in the business world since 1971. In 1988 he gave his life to Christ and since then has continually sought to develop a more intimate relationship with God. With the Holy Spirit guiding him, Greg wrote the Gifts of Freedom book series to bring others closer to God’s love through intimacy and freedom.

Avec une mystique de l’Un Origine, Néant et Principe du monde « s’opposant » à une métaphysique de l’être, Plotin convoque la pensée à un balancement entre Orient et Occident nourri par un héritage culturel à la fois grec et égyptien. L’auteur des Ennéades compose une peinture du monde comme émanation de l’être à partir de l’Un dont tout provient.        C’est précisément dans son lien à l’Un que l’homme retrouve sa provenance. Le lien de l’Un et de l’être est ce lieu singulier dans lequel on peut lire la finalité de toute chose en comprenant son origine. Penser le lien de l’Un et de l’être alors même qu’ils s’opposent mais sont indissociables, nous invite à reprendre l’unité entre continuité et altérité.       Le défi à relever avec notre questionnement est celui de renouer avec un rapport à l’origine des choses qui pourra reconstruire un dynamisme pour une pensée fédératrice au-delà des guerres d’idées.

Missional Leadership,Cornelius Niemandt,religion,First published in 2019,/works/OL23498516W,/authors/OL8908234A/Cornelius_Niemandt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 262,"The purpose and aim of this book is to develop an appropriate leadership model for missional churches. This implies a positioning of this book within the broader theology of mission and a consensus on the theology of the Missio Dei, originating at the 1952 conference of the International Missionary Council in Willingen, Germany. In this approach to the theology of mission, mission is understood as the work of the Trinitarian God, and the church is privileged to participate in God’s mission. It is against this background that the growing consensus on missional ecclesiology challenges leadership models developed for a different time and a different kind of church (with less or no emphasis on the missional character of the church). The aim is to reflect theologically on the role of leadership in the missional church. What kind of ideas about power, authority and leadership are appropriate for a missional church? New missional challenges demand new ideas about missional leadership. Church organisation and leadership reflects a theological position – there is a strong relation between ecclesiology and church organisation. The nature of the church provides the framework to understand the character of the church. What the church is determines what the church does. The church organises what it does and agrees on rules that regulate ministries and organisation. Issues such as the way the church organises and governs what it does, and thus church leadership, need to be answered against this background and understanding. Church polity and organisation, as well as leadership, must reflect the identity, calling, life and order of the church. This book, therefore, addresses life in the Trinity, participation in the Missio Dei and contours of the missional church as the point of entry to develop leadership insights. It contributes towards the development of an appropriate model of leadership for missional churches, because although recent developments in the theology of mission comprehensively addressed the area of missional ecclesiology, there is a gap in the development of a leadership model based on the concept of authority in the missional church.

Jacob Schmidts Analyse verschiedener Ansätze - etwa der von Jon Kabat-Zinn entwickelten Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) - zeigt jedoch, dass Achtsamkeitspraktiken ganz unterschiedliche Selbst- und Weltverhältnisse modellieren. Diese gehen nicht nur auf buddhistische Meditationspraktiken zurück, sondern lassen sich als komplexe Verflechtungen mit der Kultur der Moderne und der Beschleunigungsgesellschaft rekonstruieren. Hiermit liegt eine erste umfassende und systematische soziologische Studie zum populären Phänomen der Achtsamkeit vor.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Calvin for the Third Millennium,Hans Mol,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL23499317W,/authors/OL6258414A/Hans_Mol,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  ANU Press|Pages 275,"This work is a series of sermons produced by Emeritus Professor Hans Mol, and based on Biblical texts, the Commentaries of John Calvin on these texts, and on Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion. Mol is Australia’s pre-eminent scholar in the sociology of religion, particularly in Australia. His 1971 volume, Religion in Australia, was the first attempt at statistical analysis of religion in Australia, which was also internationally significant. Parallel to Mol’s interest in the sociology of religion has been his interest in Calvin. Indeed the theological basis of his life has been as a Calvinist. Here in this volume he brings both of these interests together. His sermons, preached over the years in Canberra, seek to apply the teachings of Calvin to a world-view in which the scientific study of religion, and indeed the wider study of sociology, are of central significance. In these sermons, he succeeds considerably in this. The volume is a substantial contribution to scholarship, in that the combination of these two factors has only rarely been attempted. Thus, the volume has originality and will have enduring value. It is especially appropriate that it should be published at this time, in preparation for the 500th Anniversary of Calvin’s birth (1509–2009).

Central to all texts is the fate of the souls in the afterlife and guidelines to assure redemption on Judgment Day. This includes the ability to recognize the signs of the End properly. The vernacular eschatological discourse is considered as an inherent part of the intellectual emancipation of the laity in the later Middle Ages. This book is of interest not only to Dutch and German philologists, but also to historians and anyone interested in the history of religion, especially of eschatology and apocalypticism.    This study  was awarded with the 2013 Mgr.

However, reproductive health is a matter of theological and ethical concern. Discussion pertaining to reproductive health includes a number of debates about, for instance, abortion and the termination of pregnancy, reproductive loss, childlessness, infertility, stillbirth, miscarriage and adoption. Additionally, new reproductive possibilities made available by the development of reproductive technology have necessitated theological and ethical reflection on, for example, surrogacy, post-menopausal pregnancies, litter births, single mothers or fathers by choice, in vitro fertilisation and the so-called saviour siblings. These new developments compel us to reconceive our notions of what reproductive health is or should be. Many of these topics are receiving increasing attention in a variety of theological publications. The focus of this volume is unique, however, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first volume dealing not only with reproductive issues, but also reflecting theologically and ethically on reproductive health. It makes a contribution by providing a variety of perspectives from different theological fields on this theme, and in many chapters, focussing especially on the South African context. These discussions are also part of urgent debates within churches, which require developing life-giving theological language and imaginative theological alternatives that may speak to experiences of matters relating to reproductive health. The popular books, TV series and films that touch upon these discussions – including The Handmaid’s Tale and Mother! – strengthen the perception that a more in-depth theological and ethical discussion on the theme may be necessary, particularly towards exploring stories and confessions from our faith tradition that may provide us with a timely opportunity to do the important work of theological ‘reconceiving’.

The Language of Faith in Southern Africa,Hermen Kroesbergen,religion,First published in 2019,/works/OL23498512W,/authors/OL8766930A/Hermen_Kroesbergen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 376,"The aim of this book is to provide a way to do justice to an African language of faith. In systematic theology, anthropology and philosophy of religion, similar debates about how to interpret an African language of faith are ongoing. Trying to avoid the ‘othering’ discourses of past generations, scholars are careful to take seriously what people in Africa say without portraying people’s beliefs as weird or backward. Yet, in their desperate attempts to avoid othering, these theologians, anthropologists and philosophers often painfully misconstrue the language of faith in Africa. Understanding the language of faith in Southern Africa is not an easy task. How should we take seriously the form of language that often seems so strange and different? I argue that, after African inculturation theology and black liberation theology, a better way to make sense of being a Christian in Southern Africa is to pay close attention to people’s language of faith. The way in which people speak of the spirit world or powers in Africa appears strange to outsiders, and the sense of community and the holistic worldview differentiates the African way of life from its Euro-American counterparts. When proper attention is paid to the use of concepts like spirit world, power, community and holism, language of faith in Southern Africa is neither as strange as it may seem, nor as romantic. By investigating these distinguishing concepts that colour language of faith in Southern Africa, this book contributes to future projects of both fellow theologians who try to construct a contemporary African theology and those who are interested in theology in Africa given the well-known southward shift of the centre of gravity of Christianity.

Praktiese-ekklesiologie,Wim Dreyer,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL23499880W,/authors/OL8908666A/Wim_Dreyer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 252,"The book proposes a radical transformation of existing church and training models in South African Reformed ecclesial circles. It takes the theological discussion, especially in ecclesiology, to the next level and argues for new ways to express belief in ecclesial practice. The book provides a provocative strategic vision which takes the ecclesial challenges of the twenty-first century seriously. The book will benefit not only theologians in the academy but also church leaders. Firstly, a situational analysis which focuses on the circumstances and social standing of mainstream churches in the twenty-first century, is done. Current difficulties and obstacles are identified. These can be contributed mainly to the secularisation and post-Christian tendencies of the era subsequent to the two world wars. Secondly, the responsible renewal of and much needed amendments to the structures of South African Protestant faith communities in a postmodern, postliberal, postcolonial context are proposed. The authority of scripture and the creeds of these churches are foundational for sensible renewal. The book dialogues with the relevant existing literature as it develops its ‘missional’ approach to being church in the world today. The investigation is thorough, the argumentation sound and the book makes an original and thought-provoking contribution to the field. The contribution includes biblical perspectives on ecclesial communities, a historical overview of the growth and decline of mainstream churches, insights with regard to the available empirical data, and strategies for the future. The work attests to sound methodology and a strong theoretical foundation. Literature from various parts of the world is utilised, which provides both breadth and depth to the work. The author displays an impressive ability to integrate findings from various fields and disciplines.  In die boek word voorgestel dat bestaande kerklike- en opleidingsmodelle in die Suid-Afrikaanse Hervormde ekklesiastiese kringe, ‘n ingrypende transformasie behoort te ondergaan. Dit neem die teologiese debat, veral in die ekklesiologie, tot die volgende vlak, en bepleit nuwe maniere om aan die geloof in kerklike praktyk, uiting te gee. Die boek verskaf ‘n uitdagende strategiese visie wat die kerklike uitdagings van die een-en-twintigste eeu ernstig opneem. Die boek sal nie net vir teoloë in die akademie tot voordeel wees nie, maar ook vir kerkleiers. Eerstens is daar ‘n situasie-ontleding gedoen wat op die omstandighede en die sosiale status van hoofstroomkerke in die een-en-twintigste eeu, gekonsentreer het. Huidige probleme en struikelblokke is geïdentifiseer. Dit kan hoofsaaklik toegeskryf word aan die sekularisasie en na-Christelike tendense van die tydperk na die twee wêreldoorloë. Tweedens word voorgestel dat die vernuwing van en die broodnodige wysigings aan die strukture van die Suid-Afrikaanse Protestantse geloofgemeenskape in ‘n postmoderne, postliberale en postkoloniale verband, op ‘n verantwoordelike manier gedoen word. Die gesag van die Skrif en die geloofsbelydenisse van hierdie kerke is die grondslag vir ‘n sinvolle hernuwing. In die boek word gesprek gevoer met die tersaaklike, bestaande literatuur soos wat dit sy missionale benadering om vandag kerk in die wêreld te wees, ontwikkel. Die ondersoek is deeglik, die bewysvoering is betroubaar en die boek lewer ‘n oorspronklike en gedagteprikkelende bydrae op dié gebied. Die bydrae sluit in Bybelse perspektiewe en dié van kerklike gemeenskappe, ‘n historiese oorsig van die ontwikkeling en agteruitgang van die hoofstroomkerke, insigte met betrekking tot die beskikbare empiriese gegewens en strategieë vir die toekoms.

Teologie dell’Antico Testamento,Georg Fischer,religion,First published in 2015,/works/OL23499991W,/authors/OL166890A/Georg_Fischer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  San Paolo ‒ Gregorian & Biblical Press|Pages 448,"This volume illustrates the different images of God in the books of the Old Testament. The single writings are considered synchronically in their final version. They speak in totally different ways about God and present a fascinating variety of theologies.  Dieser Band stellt die Verschiedenheit der Gottesbilder des Altes Testamentes dar. Die einzelnen Schriften werden in ihrer synchronen Endfassung betrachtet. Sie reden auf ganz unterschiedliche Weise von Gott und zeigen dabei eine faszinierende Vielfalt von Theologien auf.Nessun altro tema è trattato in maniera più ampia ed estesa, nessun altro tema è più importante del modo in cui nell’Antico Testamento si parla di Dio. Nessun’altra parola ricorre più speso del nome proprio della divinità, Yhwh. La Bibbia è davvero il libro di Dio, è Lui il primo e anche il più importante aspetto. Nella prima frase del libro della Genesi è soggetto dell’atto del creare l’universo e nell’ultima frase dei libri delle Cronache la sua presenza gioca un ruolo decisivo.    Nel presente volume, in maniera nuova, innovativa, seguendo una metodologia che presenta le caratteristiche letterarie di ogni libro nel suo «parlare di Dio» Georg Fischer si cimenta con successo a rispondere alla domanda centrale per la comprensione della visione teologica dell’Antico Testamento: come si parla di Dio al suo interno?    Il risultato è un’opera variegata e complessa, puntuale e sistematica, riassuntiva e sintetica che già nel titolo – «teologie» al plurale – cerca di rendere giustizia a una dinamica che non vuole ridurre il discorso su Dio a un minimo comune denominatore riepilogativo, ma che accetta la sfida di confrontarsi con diverse immagini, complesse prospettive, descrizioni non uniformi e contenuti spesso contrastanti della figura del Dio di Israele.     L’autore parte dall’analisi dei testi e giunge – dopo una presentazione approfondita delle teologie dei singoli libri – a un riepilogo dove le caratteristiche del Dio di Israele vengono considerate nella loro complessità, nel loro sviluppo e nelle prospettive che gettano anche sulla comprensione del Dio del Nuovo Testamento.

Togetherness in South Africa,Jakobus Vorster,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL23501269W,/authors/OL8909071A/Jakobus_Vorster,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 338,"Race and inequality have always been sensitive topics in South African society due to its colonial past, diverse social composition and apartheid legacy of legal discrimination against people on the basis of their skin colour. Racial tensions seem to be escalating in South African society and disturbing racialised rhetoric and slogans are re-entering the political and social landscape. Another disturbing phenomenon has been violent incidents of xenophobia against African immigrants. The question probed by this book is: What perspectives can theology offer in addressing the roots of racism, inequality and xenophobia in South Africa and how can it and the church contribute to reconciliation and a sense of togetherness among South African citizens? Various methodologies and approaches are used to address this question. In chapter 1, Theuns Eloff employs a historical and socio-analytical approach to describe the social context that has given rise, and is still giving impetus to racism and other forms of intolerance in South African society. Nico Vorster approaches the issue of distorted racial identity constructions from a theological-anthropological perspective. Utilising various empirical studies, he attempts to provide conceptual clarity to the concepts of racism, nationalism, ethnocentrism and xenophobia, and maps the various racisms that we find in South Africa. His contribution concludes with a theological-anthropological discussion on ways in which theology can deconstruct distorted identities and contribute to the development of authentic identities. Koos Vorster provides a theological-ethical perspective on social stratification in South Africa. He identifies the patterns inherent to the institutionalisation of racist social structures and argues that many of these patterns are still present, albeit in a new disguise, in the South African social order. Jan du Rand provides in chapter 4 a semantic discussion of the notions of race and xenophobia. He argues that racist ideologies are not constructed on a factual basis, but that racial ideologies use semantic notions to construct social myths that enable them to attain power and justify the exploitation and oppression of the other. Du Rand’s second contribution in chapter 5 provides Reformed exegetical and hermeneutic perspectives on various passages and themes in the Bible that relate to anthropology, xenophobia and the imperative to xenophilia [love of the stranger]. Dirk Van der Merwe’s contribution analyses, evaluates, and compares both contemporary literature and ancient texts of the Bible to develop a model that can enable churches to promote reconciliation in society, while Ferdi Kruger investigates the various ways in which language can be used as a tool to disseminate hate speech. He offers an analytical description of hate language, provides normative perspectives on the duty to counter hate speech through truth speaking and phronesis (wisdom) and concludes with practical-theological perspectives that might enable us to address problematic praxis. Reggie Nel explores the Confessions of Belhar and the Declaration of Accra as theological lenses to provide markers for public witness in a postcolonial South African setting. The volume concludes with Riaan Rheeder’s Christian bioethical perspective on inequality in the health sector of sub-Sahara Africa. This book contains original research. No part was plagiarised or published elsewhere. The target audience are theologians, ministers and the Christian community, but social activists, social scientists, politicians, political theorists, sociologists and psychologists might also find the book applicable to their fields.

As a part of the occation they hosted a seminar which in turn produced many of the contributions in this antology. This book seeks to discuss the place of the institution, a private, christian college, in the Norwegian higher education structure.  ""NLA Høgskolen feira 50 årsjubileum i 2018. I jubileumshelga vart det halde fleire fagseminar. Fleire av innlegga frå seminara er i ettertid arbeidd ut som artiklar som blir publiserte i denne antologien. I tillegg er vitskapleg tilsette frå ulike avdelingar utfordra til å skriva. Boka er såleis vorten ein antologi som gjennom 12 artiklar vil syna forsking og fagleg engasjement ved NLA Høgskolen.  I samband med jubileet ønskjer vi å visa høgskulen sin plass i sektoren i dag og korleis ein kristen høgskule si sjølvforståing kjem til uttrykk i faglege problemstillingar og forsking i ei rekke av fagområda ved institusjonen. Samstundes vil kvar artikkel gje ny innsikt innan sitt område.  Private høgskular er ein del av høgre utdanning, og all slik utdanning har felles lovverk og forvaltning. Vi lar ein artikkel som plasserer NLA Høgskolen i universitets- og høgskolestrukturen danna ei ramme for heilskapen i antologien.  Kyrkjefag Profil er ein serie frå Institutt for religion, livssyn og kyrkjefag ved    Høgskulen i Volda. Boka er nr. 35 i serien.  Trua gjer noko med oss. Ho kan gjere oss konservative eller radikale, liberale eller intolerante, undrande eller skråsikre. Alt dette finn ein på Vestlandet. Slik vert det fordi trua ikkje er åleine om å forme livet. Vi lever i ein kontekst, ein samanheng. For vestlendingen er konteksten sett saman av alt frå stormande hav og snødekte fjell til eit talemål som aldri let seg påverke særleg mykje av det som kom frå hovudstaden.  Denne boka formidlar ny forståing av levande religiøse tradisjonar i møte med store kulturelle endringar. Særdrag ved nyare vestnorsk historie vert studert i samanheng med den nasjonale utviklinga. Kva gjer auka individualisering, demokratisering og pluralisering med oss?""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The interdisciplinary contributions of the volume are dedicated to these experiences and their representations in various media such as Dance, music and film and especially ask about transcultural dimensions. The central example is the interface between Germany and South Asia.  Gemeinschaftliche und individuelle Erfahrungen in den Bereichen der  Kunst und der Religion werden oft als »unaussprechlich« erlebt und  beschrieben, als unmittelbar und gleichzeitig, als schwankend und  flüchtig. Sie überschreiten die Ordnung von Raum und Zeit – und sind  doch bedingt durch die konkreten rituellen Dimensionen der Auf- und  Ausführungen und des sinnlichen (aisthetischen) Erlebens. Die  interdisziplinären Beiträge des Bandes widmen sich diesen Erfahrungen  und ihren Repräsentationen in verschiedenen Medien wie z.B. Tanz, Musik  und Film und fragen besonders nach transkulturellen Dimensionen.  Zentrales Beispiel ist dabei die Schnittstelle zwischen Deutschland und  Südasien.

» Ruine d'estat «,Christian Wenzel,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL23500738W,/authors/OL3256950A/Christian_Wenzel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Heidelberg University Publishing (heiUP)|Pages 544,"Security – a category that is as important as neglected when it comes to the French Wars of Religion in the 16th century. Christian Wenzel systematically traces imaginations of security as well as their function in the French Wars of Religion for the first time, with a close focus on the perspective of the historical actors. The present study vividly recounts a broad security debate which influenced the conflicts between 1557 and 1589 to a significant degree. Thereby, the study enables not only new perspectives on pivotal junctions and processes; by introducing “Historical Security Communication” as a heuristic approach, it also contributes to Historical Security Studies and casts a light on the complexity of early modern semantics of security.  La sécurité est un sujet aussi central que largement inexploré des guerres de Religion françaises. Pour la première fois, elle est analysée ici de manière systématique et en tenant compte des modèles d’interprétation contemporains. Christian Wenzel retrace le vaste débat sur la sécurité qui a considérablement marqué les conflits entre 1557 et 1589. Son étude non seulement ouvre une nouvelle perspective sur les événements et processus centraux, mais elle contribue, grâce au concept de » communication historique sur la sécurité « développé ici, à la recherche historique sur la sécurité et montre la complexité des concepts de sécurité de l’époque moderne  Sicherheit – ein für die französischen Religionskriege ebenso zentrales wie noch weitgehend unerforschtes Thema. Christian Wenzel analysiert Vorstellungen von Sicherheit sowie ihre Funktion in den französischen Religionskriegen erstmals systematisch und mit Blick auf zeitgenössische Deutungsmuster. Anschaulich zeichnet die Studie eine breite Sicherheitsdebatte nach, die die Konflikte zwischen 1557 und 1589 maßgeblich prägte. Das ermöglicht nicht nur eine neue Perspektive auf zentrale Ereignisse und Prozesse, sondern leistet mit dem hier entwickelten Konzept der »historischen Sicherheitskommunikation« auch einen Beitrag zur historischen Sicherheitsforschung und zeigt die Vielschichtigkeit frühneuzeitlicher Sicherheitsvorstellungen.

Perspectives on theology of religions,Jaco Beyers,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL23501288W,/authors/OL8909079A/Jaco_Beyers,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 263,"In the public theology discourse, the concept ‘public square’ has become significant. In today’s multicultural and globalised world it is inevitable that people with different religious affiliations will encounter one another in the public square. ‘Public theology’ cannot but become ‘theology of religions’. Scholars in the field of religion studies are compelled to reflect theologically on the relevance of religiosity in the postmodern secular world. The term ‘theology of religions’ refers to the academic inquiry into the relationship between religions. The collected essays constitute such an inquiry. In the end, it is not so much about the encounter of religions, but rather of people. Religion is no longer regarded as a monolithic body of beliefs and practices. The authors concede that the concept ‘religion’ is too fluid to be delineated precisely. The book’s approach to the relationship between religions, i.e. ‘theology of religions’, reflects how the authors understand the origin and nature of religion (a ‘theology of religion’ in the singular). This book focuses more on ‘theology of religions’ (plural) than on ‘theology of religion’ (singular). The main objective of the book is to present a variety of perspectives on how theology of religions manifested in different contexts. This includes historical (i.e. Luther’s theology of religions and the Roman Catholic position on other religions as taken by Vatican II) as well as cultural and religious perspectives. In the first chapter, the editor gives a brief overview of the development of the discipline of theology of religions. The postmodern era is characterised by an almost non-foundational approach. The second chapter traces the development of the discipline in the Roman Catholic tradition in particular. This contribution is based on the insights of P.J. van der Merwe (1944–2014), who as researcher and Head of the Department of Science of Religion and Missiology at the University of Pretoria, developed a specific theological position on non-Christian religions. A whole generation of theologians was trained in this school of thought. He passed away in 2014 and this publication pays tribute to his life’s work on religions and their relations. The contributions that follow are the culmination of the research of postgraduate students at the University of Pretoria. The third chapter presents a perspective on the Reformation, with a particular focus on Martin Luther. In this year of the quincentenary anniversary of the Reformation the legacy of Reformed belief is highlighted. The fourth chapter describes the relationship between Christianity and Islam from the perspective of a willingness to embrace. The fifth chapter analyses the relation between Christianity, Judaism and Islam from the perspective of intergroup threat theory. A model for theology of religions in a South African context is developed in the sixth and final chapter. This scholarly book pays tribute to the academic contribution of P.J. van der Merwe, mentor of the authors of these multifaceted reflections on theology of religions. The target audience is specialists in the field of religion studies. The distinctive contribution of the book is the innovative perspectives on the relationship between Islam and Christianity in both the Roman Catholic and Protestant contexts.

G. Bauchhenss corrects some preconceived notions about iconography; F. Burillo Mozota, J. A. Arenas Esteban and M. P.

Lambert, B. Rémy, X. Delamarre analyse theonymical epithets in different ways and N. Beck scrutinizes the relationship between deities and ethnics. P. de Bernardo Stempel discusses the transformations to be observed in a provincial pantheon from the first Celtic inscriptions to the latest Roman ones; W. Spickermann questions the continuity between Pre-Roman and Romano-Celtic religion; A. Hofeneder follows the trail of an Old Celtic and later syncretic deity up to the Imperial Roman historical tradition. M. Hainzmann and P. de Bernardo Stempel present – with the help of numerous and easy understandable tables – an innovative systematization of the various syncretic phenomena known as Interpretatio, whose geographic diversity is pointed out by F. Marco Simón.

Nadenke oor 500 jaar se Reformatoriese teologie,Ignatius (Natie) W.C.

The authors want to ensure that there is also a contribution in Afrikaans in this important year. The central themes of Reformation theology are discussed. Reformation theology did not end with the contributions of Luther and Calvin, and one of the authors therefore, reflects with one of the greatest theologians alive, Jürgen Moltmann, on theology and life. In the recent past, scholars such as Ebeling and Van Selms, made valuable contributions that could be used in present-day discussions on church matters and political challenges. This book is proof that these older contributions are still important for in-depth reflections on complex theological questions. This book is also an exhibition of present-day theological research at the University of Pretoria. A diversity of opinions are tolerated, with the knowledge that there is a common love for our Reformation heritage. The book follows the internationally accepted research methodology in the field of historic theology. The classical texts of the reformers, such as Luther and Calvin, are researched in the original and made accessible to the Afrikaans readership. The book is witness to the fact that we have valuable contributions to Reformation theology coming from the recent past. The contributions are also analysed within their original historic setting and hermeneutically actualised for present-day church matters. This book is an important contribution to the Afrikaans reception of Reformation theology. For the first time, important enunciations of the reformers (especially Luther) are provided in Afrikaans with the original texts in footnotes. For the first time Adrianus Van Selms? catechetical handbook, that was recently discovered in an archive, is brought into the academic discussion. As South Africans, we struggle with issues such as gender, marriage, the political role of the church and interreligious relationships. It is clear, from this research, that the older European debates are helpful in bringing depth to our contextual debates. The target audience of the book is primarily the academic fraternity in historic theology, systematic theology and science of religion. It is, however, also accessible for ministers of religion and the general public, hence almost all the Latin, German and French quotations are translated into Afrikaans. The main aim was to make an Afrikaans contribution to Reformation 500. I declare that no part of any chapter is taken from another published work without the necessary recognition. This is original research and not one of the chapters has been published somewhere else.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Im Diesseits das Jenseits bereiten - Eschatologie, Laienbildung und Zeitkritik bei den mittelniederländischen Autoren Jan van Boendale, Lodewijk van Velthem und Jan van Leeuwen",Ulrike Wuttke,religion,,/works/OL20931985W,/authors/OL8012259A/Ulrike_Wuttke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Universitätsverlag Göttingen|Language German,"This study reveals that in medieval Dutch vernacular texts (from the Brabantine authors Jan van Boendale, Lodewijk van Velthem, and Jan van Leeuwen, and in the anonymous Boek van Sidrac) the treatment of individual and universal eschatological topics and themes, such as death, heaven, hell, purgatory, the Antichrist, eschatological people, and Judgement Day is dedicated to moral and ethical guidance to prepare oneself during lifetime for the afterlife. Central to all texts is the fate of the souls in the afterlife and guidelines to assure redemption on Judgment Day. This includes the ability to recognize the signs of the End properly. The vernacular eschatological discourse is considered as an inherent part of the intellectual emancipation of the laity in the later Middle Ages. This book is of interest not only to Dutch and German philologists, but also to historians and anyone interested in the history of religion, especially of eschatology and apocalypticism. This study was awarded with the 2013 Mgr. C. de Clercqprijs of the Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten (Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts) for an outstanding work in the field 'History of Religions of Flanders'.

In der Hannoverschen Landeskirche wurde deren Einführung als ?Jahresgespräche? besonders breit diskutiert. Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht diese Diskussionen als Ausdruck eines veränderten Selbstverständnisses der gesamten Leitungspraxis der evangelischen Kirchen und stellt sie in den Kontext der Debatten zur kirchlichen ?Organisationsreform?, die seit den 1990er Jahren die Praxis und Theorie der Kirche beschäftigen. Anhand der Visitation wird ein Modell entwickelt, das kirchliches Leitungshandeln und die damit verbundenen Konflikte und Spannungsfelder in drei Grunddimensionen beschreibt und differenziert. In Anwendung auf die Jahresgespräche werden damit Konfliktstrukturen und Problemfelder sichtbar gemacht. Auf diese Weise werden Personalentwicklung und Personalführung der Kirchen einer tiefergehenden praktisch-theologischen Reflexion unterzogen.

Following the Sun: A Practical Guide to Egyptian Religion,,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL16802152W,,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25424713M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Lulu|Language English|Pages 300,"Kemeticism, the revival of the ancient Egyptian religion, is a growing yet still poorly understood form of Paganism. The number of Kemetics online has more than doubled in the last decade, yet nearly all of the books addressing Kemeticism or Egyptian Paganism are written from an outside perspective, using outdated sources.To address this disparity, Following the Sun is the first book to unite 21st-century Egyptological research with the real-life experiences of modern Egyptian Pagan and Kemetic practitioners, covering such useful topics as Egyptian ethics; how to build and consecrate a Kemetic altar; Egyptian deities and holidays; and a historical look at major controversies such as ethnicity in ancient Egypt and the connection between Atlantis and the Sphinx. No longer will those seeking to understand and experience Egyptian religion for themselves be limited to challenging academic sources, as this book presents Egypt and her gods in an accessible, engaging manner the average reader can enjoy.

Kult początków    Historyczne zmagania z czasem, religia i geneza. Szkice z historii historiografii polskiej i obcej  1.1 Założenia wstępne. Związek historiograficznego pojęcia genezy z religijnymi korzeniami kultury europejskiej.  Chciałbym na wstępie nawiązać do książki Marca Blocha „Pochwała historii czyli o zawodzie historyka”. Współtwórca szkoły „Annales” używa w tej pracy sformułowania „obsesja genezy”. Ten termin odnosi się tam do założeń badawczych dających się streścić zdaniem Ernesta Renana: „We wszystkich sprawach ludzkich przede wszystkim początki zasługują na zbadanie” . Marc Bloch zauważa, że przekonanie, iż badając początki danego zjawiska historycznego możemy najlepiej poznać jego istotę, nie jest przekonaniem racjonalnym, lecz po prostu błędem. Błędem, który polega na pomieszaniu „rodowodu z wyjaśnianiem” . Zdaniem Blocha podanie rodowodu nie jest równoznaczne z wyjaśnieniem charakteru zjawiska historycznego, gdyż nie sposób wytłumaczyć go poza swoim czasem . Bloch przytacza tutaj wschodnie przysłowie: „Ludzie podobniejsi są do swoich czasów niż do swoich ojców”,  w odniesieniu do zjawisk historycznych oznaczałoby to, że charakter danego zjawiska historycznego dalece bardziej określają jego aktualne powiązania strukturalne niż okoliczności jego powstania. Krytykując jednak tendencje do fetyszyzacji genezy zdaje się krytykować model historiografii silnie powiązanej z literaturą i myśleniem potocznym.         Metafora genezy obecna wyraźnie w historiografii tradycyjnej jest elementem nie tyle indywidualnej praktyki badawczej, lecz raczej zakorzenionego w kulturze sposobu myślenia. Takim tropem podąża w swoich rozważaniach Wojciech Wrzosek:        „Dodajmy, że także w tym sensie, iż potoczna wiedza o człowieku i świecie go otaczającym skłania do takich ujęć początków (powstania) zjawiska, w których niezbędne staje się wskazanie na wyprzedzające czasowo okoliczności, jakie przesądzają o jego zaistnieniu. Zjawisko musi mieć swoją genezę, tak jak człowiek ma rodziców- zdają się sądzić historycy i tak stylizują narrację, aby uczynić zadość temu przeświadczeniu. Narracja historyczna jest więźniem tak rozumianej genezy i staje się dla historyka, jak pisał Marc Bloch, swoistym fetyszem.”    Dalej Wrzosek przytacza opinie, że metafora genezy jest niezbywalną składową myślenia historycznego. Poniekąd można powiedzieć, że metafora genezy jest także niezbywalną składową naszej kultury a tym samym i jej języka. W takim razie choć wyjaśnianie charakteru danego zjawiska wyłącznie za pomocą podania jego genezy możemy uznać za niewystarczające, to trudno jednak wyobrazić sobie wyjaśnianie bez nakreślenia genezy. Istotny jest tutaj mechanizm: podanie genezy - usytuowanie zjawiska w świecie. Geneza określa charakter zjawiska, jego niezmienną istotę tak jak w myśleniu potocznym pochodzenie określa człowieka.        Przekonanie o tożsamości genezy zjawiska z jego istotą i usytuowaniem w świecie, nie jest bynajmniej ograniczone do myślenia potocznego, lecz występuje powszechnie w najróżniejszych dyskursach naszej kultury. Tożsamość ta przywodzi na myśl strukturę wielu mitów „początku”.    Idea początków (genezy) zajmuje centralne miejsce w systemie mitów większości kultur- przy pewnym poziomie uogólnienia można nawet powiedzieć, że mit z zasady opowiada o wydarzeniach, które miały miejsce in principio, to znaczy u początków w chwili pierwotnej i pozaczasowej.  Inaczej mówiąc opowiada w jaki sposób, za sprawą dokonań istot nadnaturalnych: bogów bądź herosów, zaistniała aktualnie istniejąca rzeczywistość:        „Najważniejszą cechą mitu jest to, że świadczy o prawdziwości minionej, zawsze obecnej, żywej rzeczywistości. Dla krajowca mit nie jest ani fikcyjnym opowiadaniem, ani rejestracją zamierzchłej przeszłości; dowodzi istnienia ważniejszej rzeczywistości, która częściowo nadal żyje. Żyje ona w tym sensie, że pierwotne wydarzenia, prawo i moralność w niej zawarte nadal rządzą życiem społecznym tubylców.”    Oznacza to, że choć mit opowiada o wydarzeniach, które miały miejsce w nieokreślonej praprzeszłości, w nieokreślonym miejscu a nawet w nieokreślonej, „mitycznej” rzeczywistości; jest silnie skorelowany z aktualną rzeczywistością kultury, w której funkcjonuje.        „Mit uważany jest za historię świętą, a zatem „historię prawdziwą” ponieważ odnosi się do faktów rzeczywistych. Mit kosmogoniczny jest „prawdziwy” ponieważ dowodzi tego istnienie świata; mit pochodzenia śmierci jest również „prawdziwy”, ponieważ dowodzi tego śmiertelność człowieka.”  Zatem jaką funkcję spełnia mit w kulturze? W jakim celu jest przekazywany?    Istnieje teoria mówiąca o tym, że zadaniem mitu jest wyjaśnianie zjawisk, których społeczności tradycyjne nie potrafią pojąć w inny niż mityczny sposób. Mit w tym ujęciu pełniłby rolę „pranauki” w społeczności „prelogicznej”.  Z tą hipotezą polemizuje twórca szkoły funkcjonalistycznej w antropologii kulturowej Bronisław Malinowski:        „Musimy całkowicie odrzucić tę abstrakcyjną, choć zwięzłą opinię współczesnych badaczy mitów. Przyjęcie tej definicji doprowadziłoby bowiem do utworzenia wyimaginowanej nie istniejącej kategorii narracji, mianowicie mitu etiologicznego. Miałby się on odnosić do nie istniejącej potrzeby wyjaśniania, wiódłby bezowocny żywot jako wysiłek intelektualny, pozostając poza kulturą i organizacją społeczną tubylców i poza ich zainteresowaniami pragmatycznymi. Całe to podejście wydaje się nam chybione, ponieważ mity traktowane są po prostu jako opowiadania, jako pierwotne gabinetowe wysiłki intelektualne, ponieważ wyrwane są ze swego kontekstu życia i badane z punktu widzenia formy, jaką przybierają na papierze, a nie z punktu widzenia funkcji, jakie pełnią w życiu.”    Przyjrzyjmy się zatem roli jaką Malinowski, z perspektywy badacza terenowego, wyznacza mitowi w życiu badanych przez siebie kultur:    „Nic nie jest lepiej znane tubylcowi niż różne zawody wykonywane przez przedstawicieli płci męskiej i żeńskiej; niczego na ten temat nie trzeba wyjaśniać. Ale tego rodzaju różnice, chociaż znane, bywają niekiedy przykre, nieprzyjemne lub w jakiś sposób ograniczające, trzeba je więc uzasadnić, potwierdzić ich dawność i prawdziwość; krótko mówiąc- wykazać ich słuszność. Śmierć, niestety, nie jest ani niejasna, ani abstrakcyjna, ani też trudna do pojęcia dla żadnej istoty ludzkiej. [...] Mit, który usprawiedliwia wiarę w nieśmiertelność, w wieczną młodość, w życie pozagrobowe, nie jest wynikiem intelektualnej reakcji na coś nieodgadnionego, ale oczywistym aktem wiary. [...] Opowiadania o pochodzeniu rytuałów i obyczajów też nie są relacjonowane tylko po to, by je wyjaśniać. One nigdy niczego nie wyjaśniają; zawsze tylko określają precedens, który stanowi o ideale rytuału i usprawiedliwia jego trwanie, a czasami daje też praktyczne wskazówki dotyczące procedury odprawiania go.”     Mit, rozumiany tu w najszerszym tego słowa znaczeniu  konstytuuje nie tylko porządek rytualny i religijny lecz również społeczny, polityczny i historyczny. Można tu przytoczyć wiele przykładów, nie tylko zresztą z obszaru badawczego etnografii, lecz również z historii religii:     W księdze Rodzaju Starego Testamentu, będącą przecież „Księgą Genezy” opisane jest wydarzenie, które u zarania dziejów ustaliło hierarchię narodów zamieszkujących Ziemię Obiecaną. Cham ojciec Kanaana (przodek Kanaańczyków) przez swoją niewłaściwą reakcjęna postępek swojego ojca – Noego został przez niego przeklęty i wyznaczono jemu i wszystkim jego potomkom podrzędna rolę sług synów Sema (czyli Semitów):    ..rzekł [Noe] < Chował się dobrze i rósł w siły,    Coraz więcej próbował swej mocy,    Wiklinę splatał, snopy wiązał,    Chrust nosił całymi dniami.”     Opisywany chłopak był przodkiem niewolników, jego geneza wyznacza symbolicznie kondycję społeczną wszystkich niewolnych. Nie do przyjęcia byłby fakt, że przodek niewolnika nie był niewolnikiem. Geneza niewolnika musi być niewolnicza.    Następnie Rig znalazł się w domu Afiego i Ammy, którzy podczas przybycia boga zajmowali się pracami domowymi, byli starannie ubrani i uczesani (w przeciwieństwie do poprzedników) a gościa podjęli cielęciną. Gościna boga trwa tyle samo, a po dziewięciu miesiącach Amma rodzi Karla:        „Chował się dobrze i rósł w siły,        Obuczał woły, strugał radło,        Dom budował, stodołę jako cieśla robił,        Wóz robotą kołodzieja- i pługiem orał”    Jak się można domyśleć, Karl był praojcem wolnych chłopów.     Na końcu Rig kieruje swe kroki do dworu Fadira i Modir. Gospodarze otaczają się przepychem i mają wyrafinowany gust. Częstują Riga jasnym, drobno pokrojonym chlebem i winem. Historia się powtarza, a synem Modir jest Jarl:        „Wyrastał Jarl dzielnie w grodzie,        Wymachiwał tarczą, zakładał cięciwy,        Napinał łuki, osadzał strzały        Rzucał oszczepem, ćwiczył się franków lancą,        Konno jeździł, psami szczuł,        Mieczem śmigał, w pływaniu się doskonalił.”    Nad tym swoim potomkiem Rig roztoczył specjalna opiekę, nauczył go sztuki czytania runów i darował ziemię w dziedzictwo. Był protoplastą wojowników i bardów.    Mamy tutaj, używając sformułowania Mircei Eliadego, opis „wtargnięcia sfery sacrum w obręb świata.”  Wtargnięcia, które dokonało się „kiedyś na początku czasu”. Na tym wtargnięciu fundowany jest właśnie „znany” świat, za jego sprawą jest taki, „jakim go widzimy”.     Opisywane w micie wydarzenia są jednak niezwykle wazne dla społeczności nie tylko dlatego, że biorą w nich udział bogowie i bohaterowie, są ważne także dlatego, że dzieją się „u początków”. W tym mitycznym wymiarze czasu nie działy się rzeczy nieistotne. Wszystko co się wtedy wydarzyło miało moc kreatywną; stanowiło wzorzec dla obecnej rzeczywistości. Stąd mit należy przekazywac bez zmian – wszelka zmiana w opisie genezy świata oznacza zmianę w świecie. Świat „człowieka religijnego”, jak opisuje go Eliade jest światem naśladującym mit. Eliade, który nie był badaczem terenowym, a analizował mit z punktu widzenia historyka i fenomenologa religii, nie zaniedbując jednak uwzględniania w swoich teoriach wyników etnologów, podziela, w zasadzie, opinię Malinowskiego. Rozszerza jednak funkcję mitu na „dawanie” wzorca. Mit u Eliadego pełni właśnie funkcję wzorca:    „Nawet te zachowania i czynności człowieka, które nie dotyczą bezpośrednio sfery sacrum, mają swoje wzorce w gestach Istot Nadnaturalnych. [...] Według mitycznych tradycji australijskiego plemienia Karadjeri, wszystkie zwyczaje i zachowania ustanowione zostały w Czasach Snu przez dwie Istoty Nadnaturalne, Bagadjimbiri (na przykład sposób prażenia pewnych ziaren lub polowanie na zwierzynę za pomocą kija, specjalna pozycja, jaką należy przyjąć przy oddawaniu moczu, itd.)”      Istotne jest także to, że w wielu wierzeniach znajomość pochodzenia danego zjawiska, a tym samym jego istoty (nierzadko ucieleśnionej w imieniu), daje władzę nad tym zjawiskiem.        Podsumowując rozważania na temat mitu, można powiedzieć, że za pomocą przywołania genezy danego zjawiska, mit sytuuje je w rzeczywistości, jednocześnie usensawniając, legitymizując i wyjaśniając. Zjawiskiem tym najczęściej jest w mitach człowiek i to, co się najściślej z nim wiąże (płciowość, kultura, śmiertelność).        Widać tutaj podobieństwo pomiędzy myśleniem mitycznym i strukturą narracyjną mitu a myśleniem historycznym, zdominowanym metaforą genezy i strukturą genetycznego przedstawiania oraz wyjaśniania zjawisk historycznych. Podobieństwo to „samo w sobie” niewiele nam mówi. Należy jeszcze wykazać lub przynajmniej sensownie postawić hipotezę o zależności pomiędzy świadomością mityczną a historyczną oraz określić (chociażby w przybliżeniu) na podstawie czego ta zależność mogłaby istnieć.        Obecność mitycznych struktur postrzegania świata w naukowej narracji historycznej można wyjaśnić na sposób genetyczny. Zakładamy wtedy, że wszelkie dyskursy o świecie (w tym także dyskurs naukowy) wywodzą się z mitu i zawierą w sobie elementy struktur mitycznych. Pogląd ten reprezentował na gruncie antropologii James Frazer. W socjologii Max Weber, autor koncepcji o dwóch „odczarowaniach świata” oraz, z punktu widzenia filozofa, Ernst Cassirer, którego cytuję za pośrednictwem polskiego rzecznika omawianej tezy – Jerzego Kmity:        „Otóż Cassirer w związku z wymienioną formą formą symboliczną, [czyli mitem- W.W] [...] zauważa, że tkwi w nas gdy tworzymy swa rzeczywistość w ramach pozamitycznych form symbolicznych jakaś pozostałość myślenia mitycznego, której nie da się bezkarnie usunąć.”  Tę pozostałość nazywa Cassirer „starszym pokładem”, na którym ufundowane są wszystkie współczesne dziedziny kultury w tym: nauka, sztuka, filozofia i religia.        Koncepcja ta, choć szeroko reprezentowana, zawiera założenie pewnej liniowości. Przechodzenia mitu w inne formy kultury, bądź wyłaniania się z mitu religii, filozofii i nauki, w następstwie jego odczarowywania lub „demistyfikacji”. Nie tłumaczy wobec tego zjawiska koegzystencji myślenia mitycznego i naukowego zarówno w naszej kulturze, jak i w kulturach tradycyjnych. Koegzystencji, która nie wykazuje żadnych śladów „wypierania” jednej postawy wobec świata przez drugą ani nawet uwiądu jednej z nich na korzyść rozszerzania się drugiej.    Na ten temat pisze Bronisław Malinowski: „Tak więc przy budowie czółna empiryczna znajomość materiału technologii, pewnych zasad stabilności i hydrodynamiki występuje w towarzystwie i ścisłym związku z magią, przy czym żadna nie jest skażona drugą. Krajowcy wiedzą na przykład doskonale o tym, że im większa jest rozpiętość wysięgnika, tym większa jest stabilność, ale tym mniejsza odporność na naciski. Potrafią wyraźnie wytłumaczyć, dlaczego rozpiętości tej dają pewien tradycyjny wymiar, określony ułamkiem długości całej łodzi z wydrążonego pnia.”     Podobnie sprawa wygląda z działalnością rolniczą czy raczej ogrodniczą Melanezajczyków, którzy łączą wiedzę na temat gleby i metod pielęgnowania roślin oraz zwalczania szkodników z wiedza magiczną.  Eliade wspomina z kolei o tym, jak na Timorze, gdy kiełkuje pole ryżowe, krajowcy, doskonale znający się na uprawie ryżu, wędrują na pole ryżowe, by deklamować mit pochodzenia ryżu. Ma to, niezależnie od włożonej w uprawę pracy i znajomości praktycznych metod, pokazać roślinie jej pochodzenie i zachęcić ją, by wzeszła tak dorodna i gęsta, jak wtedy, gdy pojawiła się „pierwszy raz”.     Można jednak skoncentrować się na funkcji jaką spełniał mit w społeczności „człowieka religijnego” a jaką funkcję w naszej kulturze spełniają nauki o człowieku?        Mircea Eliade twierdzi, że:    „tak jak człowiek współczesny uważa się za istotę ukonstytuowaną przez Historię, tak człowiek należący do społeczności archaicznych postrzega siebie jako rezultat pewnych wydarzeń mitycznych.”     Formułuje on także hipotezę, w jakich okolicznościach doszło do przejęcia przez opowieści świeckie „fałszywe” „ukorzeniającej” funkcji opowieści świętych par exellence prawdziwych.  Teza Eliadego zakłada koegzystencję w ramach jednej kultury świeckiej wiedzy o przeszłości oraz sakralnej wiedzy o przeszłości mitycznej, jest to nota bene, potwierdzone przez Malinowskiego w odniesieniu do obserwowanych przez niego kultur.  W warunkach kultury greckiej, jak twierdzi Eliade, „doszlo” do utożsamienia wiedzy mitycznej z fałszem, czyli do „zamiany ról”.         Zwróćmy tu uwagę na stwierdzenie, że w naszej kulturze zarówno historiografia jak i mityczne systemy odniesienia (takie jak religia, parapsychologia, okultyzm) spełniają równolegle tę samą funkcję: ukorzeniają jednostkę w świecie. Mówią mu, „skąd przyszedł”, „kim jest” oraz sugerują „dokąd zmierza” czy dokąd ma zmierzać.    Nie chciałbym tutaj spekulować na temat, czy historiografia ma prawo odpowiadać na te pytania, czy realizowanie przez nią funkcji mitycznych jest uzurpacją, chciałbym natomiast zastanowić się nad tym, w jaki sposób to czyni?  1.2 Cele badawcze pracy. Założenia selekcji tekstów. Przegląd stosowanych narzędzi interpretacyjnych.  Aby odpowiedzieć na to pytanie należy zbadać prace historyczne, szukając w nich śladów mitycznych struktur pojmowania zjawisk. Oczywiście należy najpierw założyć, że może istnieć w dziełach historycznych, napisanych przez różnych autorów i oglądających problem genezy zjawisk historycznych z różnych perspektyw badawczych, pewnego rodzaju stała struktura pojmowania genezy danego zjawiska jako konstytuującego jego niezmienną istotę. Założenie to nie jest oczywiste, ponieważ nie jest nawet oczywistym stwierdzenie, że istnieje coś takiego jak stała i możliwa do odtworzenia struktura tekstu kulturowego. Zagadnienie to było przedmiotem gorącej dyskusji, w której brały udział tak sławne postacie współczesnej humanistyki jak: Umberto Eco, Richard Rorty i Claude Levi-Strauss. . Dyskusja ta jest niezwykle ważna z perspektywy badań nad tekstem, dyskutowano bowiem na temat roli interpretatora w tworzeniu struktury dzieła interpretowanego. Innymi słowy, czy istnieje coś takiego jak trwała struktura tekstu, do której dociera się za pomocą analizy tekstu, czy struktura ta jest wytwarzana przez interpretatora w procesie interpretacji? Consensus wydaje się być możliwy, gdy spojrzymy na problem z perspektywy pojęć psychologii analitycznej  i założymy, że zarówno autor tekstu interpretowanego jak i interpretator funkcjonują w obrębie jednej kultury. Wówczas twórca tekstu i twórca interpretacji tekstu funcjonują w obrębie tej samej struktury pojmowania świata  i nie dochodzi do wytworzenia takiej interpretacji, która praktycznie wytworzyłaby tekst w jego najgłębszych warstwach na nowo. W tym wypadku najgłębsze warstwy tekstu – warstwy, które pochodzą z charakterystycznego dla danej kultury sposobu pojmowania świata pozostają w procesie interpretowania nienaruszone. Dla naszych rozważań jest to stwierdzenie niezwykle istotne – bowiem celem analizy jest właśnie dotarcie do struktury postrzegania świata obecnej w historycznym tekście o religii. Analizowane teksty zostały wybrane z polskiego piśmiennictwa zajmującego się problemem genezy zjawiska religijnego. Nie są to teksty wyłącznie z obszaru profesjonalnej historiografii, lecz teksty, w których uwzględniona została perspektywa czasu charakterystyczna dla rozważań historycznych. Analizowane teksty nie mają jednolitego poziomu naukowego, obok prac spełniających najwyższe normy naukowości, znajdują się tu prace z pogranicza nauki i eseistyki historycznej i politycznej. Umieszczenie tak różnorodnych tekstów na wspólnej (choć niejednakowej) płaszczyźnie interpretacyjnej ma na celu sprawdzenie, jakie znaczenie mają indywidualne cechy autora tekstu (jego erudycja, znajomość źródeł, sposób konceptualizacj problemu) w obszarze głębokich struktur pojmowania zjawisk. Wzoruję się tutaj na metodzie badawczej Michela Foucaulta, który dla ukazania zbiorowej świadomości badanego momentu rozwojowego kultury analizował głównie teksty mało znane, czy wręcz mierne naukowo lub literacko – ukazać miały nie indywidualny warsztat literacki i naukowy autora, lecz świadomość swoich czasów, w której w podobny sposób partycypują artysta wybitny i mierny.      Dlatego też dla potrzeb niniejszej pracy, której zadaniem będzie dotarcie do głębokich struktur świadomości związanej z myśleniem historycznym i postrzeganiem świata w obrębie naszej kultury, teksty naukowo wybitne i naukowo mierne są w sposób jednakowy istotne, lecz oczywiście jakościowe róznice między tekstami sa dostrzegane i respektowane przez zastosowanie nieco odmiennych narzędzi interpretacyjnych.        Dobór tekstów miał za zadanie zaprezentować różne perspektywy badawcze, filozoficzne w narracjach tworzonych według niejednolitych reguł (akademickich, literackich, dogmatycznych, eseistycznych). Zaprezentowana w powyższej pracy grupa tekstów nie wyczerpuje jednak bogactwa i zróżnicowania polskiego pismiennictwa historycznego i religioznawczego i tym samym nie może orzekać o takim czy innym charakterze polskiej powojennej historiografii religii. Zadaniem tej pracy będzie analiza występujących w tym obszarze strategii narracyjnych i próba odniesienia ich do występujących w mitach początku struktur pojmowania świata, a nie formułowanie opinii o cechach polskiej historiografii religii rozumianej jako całość.    Pierwszym narzędziem interpretacyjnym będzie analiza retoryczno-erystyczna. Stosowana będzie do analizy publicystyczno – ideologicznej warstwy tekstu, w której autor bądź to dyskutuje z konkurencyjnymi teoriami, bądź to argumentuje za przyjęciem własnej. Warstwa ta odgrywa zasadniczą rolę w wielu analizowanych tekstach, głównie – lecz nie tylko, w tych w których autor skoncentrował się na retorycznym przekonaniu czytelnika co do słuszności swoich tez zaniedbując argumentację merytoryczną. Ponieważ narracja historyczna w swej warstwie retorycznej nie wykształcała środków wyrazu radykalnie odmiennych od środków wyrazu stosowanych w literaturze i publicystyce, stąd narzędzia interpretacji retorycznej stosowane w tekstach literackich i publicystycznych nie wymagają specjalnych przekształceń, aby można je było zastosować w tekście historycznym. Analiza retoryczna jest cennym narzędziem, ukazuje bowiem wielokrotnie sprzeczności pojęciowe występujące w tekstach, wynikające nie tyle z partykularnych błędów autora tekstu, lecz z pęknięć pojęciowych obecnych w dyskursach ideologicznych.  Kolejnym narzędziem interpretacyjnym obecnym w niniejszej pracy będzie analiza pojęciowa, jej zadaniem jest wyłonienie podstawowych pojęć porządkujących merytoryczną stronę narracji. Analiza ta występuje w tej pracy samodzielnie bądź jako element kolejnego narzędzia interpretacyjnego: analizy strukturalnej, której zadaniem jest odsłonięcie struktury pojęciowej tekstu. W tym celu wyodrębnione zostaja pojęcia prymarne i pomocnicze oraz zostają określone związki pomiędzy pojęciami. Charakter tych związków może być bardzo różnorodny, najwięcej jednak uwagi w tej pracy zotało poświęcone związkom generowania i wynikania, co jest zwiazane z jej tematem.  Następnym krokiem jest analiza metastrukturalna, w której przedmiotem badania jest sposób weryfikacji informacji źródłowej, z której korzystał autor analizowanego tekstu. Porządek w interpretowanych tekstach rzadko jest  określony explicite, stąd występujące w tej pracy modele porządku weryfikacji informacji mają oczywiście hipotetyczny charakter. Do analizy metastrukturalnej należy także wyodrębnienie rodzajów informacji wystepujących w analizowanych tekstach. Inną rolę odgrywa bowiem w tekście historycznym wiedza merytoryczna , z którą historyk przystępuję to badań (założenia aprioryczne), wiedza, która steruje postępowaniami badawczymi historyka i wiedza, która pochodzi z jego znajomości źródeł.  Ustalenie relacji nadrzędności i podrzędności tych rodzajów informacji oraz rodowodu pojęć występujących w badanych tekstach jest bardzo ważne w związku z tym, że badane teksty nie są wyalienowane, lecz uczestniczą aktywnie w konkretnych dyskursach naukowych i filozoficznych, zapożyczając z nich wiele koncepcji i pojęć.  Wreszcie wyodrębnione zostają związki pojęciowe występujące w tekstach: do podstawowych związków pojęciowych są tu zaliczone: koncepcja istoty i koncepcja genezy opisywanego zjawiska. Określenie ich relacji w analizowanych tekstach jest podstawowym zadaniem tej pracy.  Wnioski końcowe - podsumowania  2.1 Wnioski dotyczące występowania w tekście historycznym struktury pojmowania zjawisk charakterystycznej dla mitów początku.  Mity to według uznawanego obecnie w antropologii kulturowej określenie Levi-Straussa, święte opowieści o czynach bogów i bohaterów, które są odpowiedzialne za pochodzenie wszystkich rzeczy oraz oraz obecny porządek świata.  Jednak mit funkcjonuje tu i teraz, w czasie i w miejscu, w których jest opowiadany. Opowiadający mit także funkcjonuje w swoim a nie mitycznym wymiarze czasowym i przestrzennym. Ontologiczny porządek zdarzeń opisywanych w micie biegnący od mitycznej genezy zjawiska do jego określonego funkcjonowania tu i teraz nie jest zgodny z porządkiem epistemologicznym biegnącym od tu i teraz czyli czasu i miejsca gdzie mit jest opowiadany do czasu i miejsca mitycznego, gdzie należy doszukiwac się genezy opisywanego w micie stanu rzeczy. Istnienie obecnego świata jest niezbędne dla istnienie mitu. Mit przestaje funkcjonować jako mit gdy przestaje istnieć świat, który uzasadniał. Świat, w którym mit funkcjonuje (i który uzasadnia) jest równie ważnym elementem mitu jak świat, który jest w nim opisywany. Wszelkie modyfikacje świata, w którym mit jest opowiadany muszą modyfikować także i sam mit gdyż ten świat jest elementem mitu a nie rzeczywistością wobec niego wyizolowaną.  Świat tu i teraz funkcjonuje bowiem w micie jako ontologiczny punkt dojścia i epistemologiczny punkt wyjścia a świat mitycznego początku jest ontologicznym punktem wyjścia, lecz epistemologicznym punktem dojścia. Oba te światy są wartościami poznawczo równoważnymi gdyż człowiekowi żyjącemu w obrębie oddziaływani danego mitu świat tu i teraz jest dany przez pryzmat świata mitycznego początku a świat mitycznego początku przez pryzmat świata tu i teraz.    Podobną strukturę można było zauważyć w badanych tekstach historycznych. Geneza danej religii jest ontologicznym punktem wyjścia, jest jednak opisywana w ciągłym i nieprzerwanym związku z funkcjonującą tu i teraz koncepcją danej religii. ta współczesna danemu tekstowi koncepcja religii jest uzasadniana i wyprowadzana z zawartego w tekście opisu genezy tej religii. Autor tekstu żyjąc tu i teraz  wychodzi od współczesnej mu ogólnej koncepcji religii, ta koncepcja jest podstawą zawartej implicite w tekście koncepcji istoty religii. Istota religii jest pojmowana jako zespół jej cech, które nie podlegają przebrażeniom historycznym – są niezmienne i uniwersalne – to znaczy wystepują we wszystkich formach danej religii bądź religii w ogóle. Jeżeli zatem uznajemy, że pewne cechy religii mają charakter niezmienny historycznie to spodziewamy się je znaleźć w najpierwotniejszej formie religii – ich obecność jest wręcz logicznie niezbędna. Obraz genezy religii powstaje zatem w związku z zawartą w tekście koncepcją jej uniwersalnej istoty.     Porządek epistemologiczny jest zatem dokładną odwrotnością porządku ontologicznego, w którym autor wychodząc od opisu genezy zjawiska wyróżnia w jego pierwotnej formie jego uniwersalną istotę, która jest podstawą do opisu form dojrzałych istniejących tu i teraz. Argumentacja przebiega turaj w sposób następujący: Jeżeli w swej najpierwotniejszej formir religia miała dane cechy to są to cechy ważniejsze od nabytych później. Są ważniejsze gdyż są niezmienne (wchodzą w skład tzw. istoty religii). Jeżeli są niezmienne to należy się spodziewać ich obecności w religiach funkcjonujących współcześnie (tu i teraz). Zatem taki a nie inny charakter religii dzisiejszych można wtyjaśnić przedstawiając ich genezę. W ten sposób rzeczywistość współczesna autorowi tekstu jest elementem tekstu analogicznie do tego w jaki sposób rzeczywistość funkcjonowania mitu jest elementem mitu.  Sposób konceptualizacji religii współczesnej przez autora narracji jest zatem epistemologicznym punktem wyjścia i ontologicznym punktem dojścia. Oznacza to, że autor opisując genezę religii historycznej uzasadnia swój sposób pojmowania religii mu współczesnej. Podobnie opis genezy religii jest ontologicznym punktem wyjścia i epistemologicznym punktem dojścia. W badanych tekstach występuje bowiem tendencja by widzieć w historycznie najpierwotniejszej formie religii jej „czystą formę”. Ta najpierwotniejsza religia kumuluje w sobie wszystkie jej najistotniejsze cechy. W rzeczowym porządku narracji opis genezy ma znaczenie kluczowe uzasadbia bowiem opis istoty i sposób pojmowania religii przez autora. Sposób pojmownia religii przez autora narracji jest z kolei uwarunowany inną narracją i tym samym występującym w niej opisem genezy. W ten sposób geneza religii jest pojmowana przez pryzmat spsosbu pojmowania religii współczesnej a religia współczesna jest postrzegana w związku z opisem swojej genezy.  2.2 Wnioski epistemologiczne. Problem narracji historycznej jako systemu samopotwierdzającego się.  System samopotwierdzający nastawiony jest na potwierdzenie założeń wstępnych. Jego specyfika polega na tym, że przyjmując jego wstępne definicje i założenia musimy (nie chcąc popaść w sprzeczności) ostatecznie je potwierdzić. System taki Popper nazywa systemem niefalsyfikowalnym  nie podlegającym naukowej weryfikacji. W tym wypadku weryfikacji podlegać może oczywiście proces argumentowania stosowany przez danego autora, który świadczy o jego warsztacie naukowym i znajomości źródeł natomiast weryfikacji nie podlega wstępne zdefiniowanie charakteru religii. Nie można zweryfikować stwierdzenia, że religia jest przejawem alienacji człowieka projektującego swe pragnienia na rzeczywistość zewnetrzną (bądź uzewnętrznione twory własnego umysłu) lub twierdzenia, że jest reakcja na zetknięcie z sacrum, gdyż weryfikacja danej definicji odbywa się jedynie w oparciu o inna definicję religii a religia nie jest uchwytna „obiektywnie” czyli poza kontekstem kulturowym badającego.     Podstawowy problem polega na tym, że definicja religii jaką badacz przyjmie na wstępie wpływa nie tylko na aksjologiczną warstę pracy, lecz ingeruje również w sposób selekcji źródeł i sposób ich weryfikacji. Definicja wstępna, która jest przecież przejawem tego w jaki sposób autor widzi przedmiot badań praktycznie zawiera w sobie gotowe ustalenia końcowe. Działa tutaj swojego rodzaju efekt domina. Autorzy badanych teskstów przyjmując konkretną definicje religii przyjmowali określony sposób oglądu tego zjawiska. Definicje w analizowanych pracach przyjmowane były domyślnie za uniwersalne tzn określające zjawisko w jego istocie. W zadnej z prac nie wystąpiła próba weryfikacji przyjętej definicji religii w oparciu o zbadany materiał źródłowy. Ta kwestia leżała poza wszelką dyskusją jako założenie na którym opiera się cały wywód. Założenie to jednak staje się podstawą do zbudowania kolejnego pojęcia już otwarcie obecnego w tekstach a mianowicie pojęcia istoty religii. Koncepcja istoty religii występuje w tekstach z uzasadnieniem faktograficznym – autorzy starają się uzasadnic dlaczego te a nie inne cech religii uznali za charakterystyczne i uniwersalne a inne za zmienne i lokalne. Argumentacja ta występuje jednak tu jako uzasadnienie dla wyciągniątych wczesniej wniosków, ma więc wtórny charakter i w wielu pracach jest bardzo zawężona. Kolejnym posunięciem, widocznym już explicite w tekście jest zdefiniowanie pierwotnej formy religii jako formy czystej. Zjawisko u swej genezy ma prezentować jedynie swe najbardziej charakterystyczne dla siebie cechy, lub cechy najbardziej charakterystyyczne mają być jednocześnie cechami najbardziej pierwotnymi.  Pojęcie genezy zjawiska ontologicznie pierwsze jest w tym porządku zaledwie pochodną założeń wstępnych poddanych transformacji w koncepcję istoty. Pojęcie genezy nie jest zatem pojęciem centralnym w narracji choć zajmuje ważne miejsce w porządku argumentowania. Powyższy schemat ukazuje, że w porządku konstruowania narracji główną rolę odgrywaja założenia wstepne, które można zaliczyć wg terminologii Topolskiego  do wiedzy pozaźródłowej. Podobne zależności wystepują także w porządku weryfikacji informacji, gdyż niezwykle rzadko można spotkać próby zweryfikowania własnych założeń wstepnych w oparciu o informacje źródłową, znacznie częściej informacja źródłowa dopełnia i uzasadnia założenia wstępne. Porównując różne prace o diametralnie innych założeniach wstępnych, lecz oparte o podobne, czy wręcz identyczne teksty źródłowe zwracamy uwagę, że wnioski do których doszli autorzy powtarzają zróżnicowania założeń wstępnych ignorując podobieństwo informacji źródłowej. Informacja zawarta w tekście źródłowym wpływa zatem w sposób znikomy na wnioski końcowe, choć odgrywa zasadniczą rolę w procesie argumentowania i uzasadniania założeń wstępnych. Otwartym pozostaje pytanie, czy przedstawiona powyżej sytuacja jest związana z cechami narracji historycznej, lub szerzej rzecz ujmując narracji nauk humanistycznych, czy wiąże się głównie z problemem funkcjonowanioa religii w opisie naukowym.  2.3 Wnioski ontologiczne. Zjawisko religii jako przedmiot refleksji naukowej.  Religia jest z pewnością zjawiskiem specyficznym i niełatwo poddającym się naukowemu badaniu. Powyższe analizy wskazują na fundamentalną rolę założeń wstepnych w refleksji nad religią. Wyznaczają one kierunek rozwoju dociekań i często zwierają w sobie wręcz wnioski końcowe. Ich siła oddziaływania wynika jednak głównie z niedostatku refleksji teoretycznej nad różnymi definicjami religii stosowanymi w dyskursie naukowym. Występujące w badanej literaturze rozważania teoretyczne mają bowiem nierzadko charakter pozorny zmierzający do wyłonienia jednej właściwej koncepcji religii i odrzucenia koncepcji fałszywych. Można powiedzieć, że silne przekonania o obiektywnej prawdziwości tylko jednej z możliwych definicji religii owocuje podporządkowaniem całej narracji, całego wysiłku włożonego w analizę źródeł udowodnieniu prawdy przyjętej jeszcze przed rozpoczęciem właściwych badań.     Taką sytuację moznaby wyjasnić przez stwierdzenie, że wobec takiego zjawiska jak religia nikt w istocie nie może pozostać obojętnym i stąd nie ma tu miejsca na „naukowy” obiektywizm, każdy jest tu w istocie wierzącym – bez względu na to czy opowiada się po stronie któregoś z wyznań czy występuje jako pozytywista, materialista, scjentysta. Wszystkim metanarracjom niereligijnym towarzyszyła i towrzyszy duża doza matafizyki, sa one bardziej religia mi alternatywnymi niż alternatywą dla religii. Tym samym założenia wstępne zawsze mają charakter religijny a konieczność ich potwierzdzenia jest wpisana w logike twierdzeń wiary, które albo są prawdziwe (oczywiście z perspektywy wyznawców) albo nie istnieją. Nie ma twierdzeń wiary prawdziwych „pod warunkiem...”, lub „przy założeniu...” tak jak pojmuje się twierdzenia naukowe,których prawdziwość jest zawsze chwilowa – do czasu, aż nie zostanie zweryfikowana przez postęp badań. Takie wyjaśnienie wymagałoby jednak założenia istnienia czegoś takiego jak religijny instynkt człowieka. temu zagdanieniu po święcił wiele uwagi Mircea Eliade, autor koncepcji o homo religiosus . religijnym przodku dzisiejszego człowieka zsekularyzowanego. Człowieka współczesny funkcjonuje według tej koncepcji w śwircie zsekularyzowanym pozbawionym obecności oprawdziwegfo sacrum, lecz funkcjonuje na religijną modłę, powielając religijne wzorce zachowań swoich przodków. Stąd powszechna obecność we współczesnej kulturze substytutów religii, do których Eliade zalicza między innymi dogmatyczny marksiszm i psychoanalizę. Można jednak częściowo uniknąć tego porównując funkcje jaką realizował mit w kulturach „człowieka religijnego” i funkcje jakie spełnia narracja naukowa współczesnie.  2.4 Realizowanie funkcji mitu przez narrację historyczną.  Rolą poznawczą mitu było ukazywania istoty współczesnych zjawisk za pomoca ukazania ich mitycznej genezy. Jego rolą społeczną była legitymizacja status quo i określanie pożądanego, właściwego kierunku zmian. Mit zaczął zanikać w kulturze europejskiej w związku z rozwojem myślenia historycznego  i narracji historycznej która ukazywała istotę zjawisk, uzasadniała stan rzeczy i określała kierunek rozwoju za pomocą ukazania historycznej genezy zjawisk. W kulturze starożytnej Grecji możemy zaobserwować jak płynnie historiografia zajmuje miejsce mitu przejmując większość jego poznawczych funkcji i rozwijając funkcje społeczne. Nie wszystkie bowiem mity wykluczały mozliwośc zmian w aktualnym porządku świata. Historia akcentując niezwykle możliwość i konieczność zmian, rozwija tu specyfikę mitów ludów indoeuropejskich  akcentujących zmienność świata i kreatywną rolę człowieka. Ukazuje człowiekowi „skąd przyszedł”, „kim jest” oraz sugerują „dokąd zmierza” czy dokąd ma zmierzać.    Nie chciałbym tutaj spekulować na temat, czy historiografia ma prawo odpowiadać na te pytania, czy realizowanie przez nią funkcji mitycznych jest uzurpacją, chciałbym natomiast zastanowić się nad tym, w jaki sposób to czyni?     W przypadku mitu „wystarczy” podać genezę zjawiska, historia jednak mitem nie jest i dysponuje zupełnie innym instrumentarium pojęciowym i innym rodzajem myślenia. Naśladowanie przez nią mitycznych mechanizmów wyjaśniania może doprowadzić do metafizycznych, dogmatycznych sporów na temat „jednej prawdziwej przyczyny”, np. rozbiorów Polski w XVIII wieku. Z drugiej strony nie można lekceważyć zawodowego kunsztu historyków, którzy, nawet jeżeli stosują taką metodę wyjaśnianie zjawisk, czynią to w sposób niezwykle umiejętny. Przykładem tu mogą być wspomniani polscy historycy szkoły krakowskiej i warszawskiej, lecz również historycy – moderniści z Fernandem Braudelem na czele. Historiografia modernistyczna nie odchodzi bowiem od metafory genezy choć stosuje ją w specyficzny sposób .     Na konflikt historiografii globalnej, antyzdarzeniowej z historiografią tradycyjną, narodową, partykularną i polityczną można bowiem spojrzeć także w aspekcie walki dwóch mitów.        Mit narodowy ukorzeniał jednostkę jako przedstawiciela konkretnej nacji, partykularnej kultury, obywatela konkretnego państwa, budował jego świadomość w opozycji względem obcego- wrogiego i zdradliwego sąsiada i wewnętrznego wroga – agenta obcych. W kreowaniu tej świadomości miała niemały udział nowożytna historiografia narodowa, która choć deklarowała pisanie : „Jak rzeczywiście było”, stosowała tu odpowiedni filtr: polityczny i narodowy. Nie na darmo Otto von Bismarck wyraził się, że wojnę z Austrią wygrał wiejski nauczyciel. Nauka historii była ważnym elementem w wychowywaniu rekruta, już wojny rewolucyjne i napoleońskie wykazały, że żołnierz, który „wie”, za co się bije, bije się lepiej . Stąd historiografia tradycyjna zajmowała (i zajmuje) ważne miejsce na uczelniach państwowych i w systemie edukacji powszechnej. Jeśli człowiek „widzi” swoją genezę w historii swojego państwa, to już w duży sposób utożsamił się z nim, gdyż struktura mityczna powoduje iż utożsamiamy się ze swoją genezą.        Można jednakże człowiekowi zaproponować inną genezę, czyni to historiografia nieklasyczna. Dostrzega korzenie jednostki w procesach globalnych: ekonomicznych, społecznych i religijnych. Przykladem sztandarowej pracy, fundującej „nową genezę”, jest „Morze Śródziemne” Fernanda Braudela i historyków skupionych wokół pisma „Annales”.    Nowy sposób usytuowania człowieka proponuje także historia regionalna, mikrohistoria, ostatnio coraz bardziej popularna w jednoczącej się Europie, jeszcze inaczej „ukorzenia” nas antropologia historyczna i historia mentalności. Coraz więcej szkół i dyskursów ideologicznych, wspomaganych współczesną technologią środków masowego przekazu, „walczy o duszę” współczesnego człowieka, mówi mu, „skąd przyszedł”, „kim jest” i sugeruje „dokąd ma zmierzać”, w kierunku partykularyzmu, zamknięcia się na „obcych”, bądź „barbarzyńców”, lub, przeciwnie w stronę niedookreślonej globalności i kosmopolityzmu. Nie jest to bynajmniej aktywność jednostronna, odbiorca  „tekstów” domaga się od ich twórców, by powiedzieli mu, kim jest, z czym ma się identyfikować, do czego dążyć. Wierzy, że rozwiązanie jest jedno, „prawdziwe” i wykluczające istnienie alternatywnych.    Wspomagany przez mityczną strukturę warunkującą ludzkie myślenie, historyk- o ile nie jest „głosem wołającego na pustyni”, lecz włączy się w dyskurs ideologiczny, który wyposaży go w potężne środki współczesnego przekazu informacji, ma nierzadko w rękach prawdziwy „rząd dusz”. Czy jest tego świadomy? Jak go wykorzystuje?   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Nabataean religion is known principally from inscriptions in Nabataean Aramaic, iconography, archaeology and Greek literary texts. After a critical survey of the sources, the author analyzes systematically the information on the individual gods worshipped by the Nabataeans, including a detailed illustrated account of temples and iconography. A further major section discusses religious themes: aniconism, henotheism, death-cult and the divinization of kings. In a final chapter, Nabataean religion is considered in relation to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The book should be of particular interest to historians of religion in the Graeco-Roman Near East and to Semitic epigraphists.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Speaking of the vital importance of hymns in the life of the church, John MacArthur writes: ""Hymns are wonderful didactic tools, filled with Scripture and sound doctrine, a medium for teaching and admonishing one another, as we are commanded to do in Colossians 3:16. We are in danger of losing a rich heritage of hymnody as some of the best hymns of our faith fall into neglect. Let's revive some of the great hymns that have fallen into disuse, and along with the best hymns written today, delve deeply into this rich Christian hymnology."" Motivated by that perspective, this new hymnal combines the most beloved hymns of church history with profound songs that are being written in the church today. Features of the hymnal include: Over 350 hymns, of which there are more than 100 new hymns and melodies; 34 titles written or co-written by Stuart Townend; 30 titles written or co-written by Keith Getty; 9 new hymns by Chris Anderson and Greg Habegger; 7 titles by John Newton and 18 by Isaac Watts; 5 titles by Bob Kauflin and 11 titles from Sovereign Grace Music; 2 new hymns from R.C. Sproul; 2 hymns from John MacArthur; Accompaniments by Bob Kauflin, Keith Getty, Mark Rice, Tom Jennings and others; ESV scripture readings, formatted for responsive readings; Only ESV hymnal in print; Large print and binding (approximately 6.75 by 9.75 inches). At the core of this version are 186 titles that will match up with orchestra and instrumental parts available at www.lifewayworship.com. An accompaniment edition with piano and chord symbols will be released in March 2016. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What can contemporary Malays contribute by way of an active intellectual and social life towards reform and progress? Where are the loci of critical thought in Malay public life?  In a revealing book of essays edited by Mohamed Imran Mohamed Taib and Nurul Fadiah Johari, writers from various backgrounds—academics, researchers, community organisers, and social activists—offer insights and critical reflections into contemporary Malay society. These essays span wide-ranging fields—from culture to religion, identity to literature, faith to governance—with a shared objective: to promote the will to think and challenge dominant perspectives.  By actively engaging in the identification of problems in society, defining and diagnosing them, Budi Kritik offers ways to overcome these problems through deep thinking, cogent analysis, perceptive insights, and an unwavering commitment to lasting peace and progress. This is a necessary and urgent book for anyone asking where the Malay voices are in public discourse.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wiley & Sons|Language English|Pages 266,"A prominent rabbi shows how to apply the wisdom of the Psalms in our daily lives    Traditionally attributed to King David, among others, the book of Psalms collects 150 songs in praise of the Lord-songs that contain some of the Bible's most beautiful and inspiring verses. Now, one of America's most esteemed rabbis elucidates the meaning of the Psalms and explains how their healing wisdom can help us in our everyday lives. Examining each of the Psalms in turn, Rabbi Joshua Haberman shows how these ""dialogues with God"" offer comfort in our struggles to cope with adversity and improve our lot in life, whether we're seeking deliverance from suffering, giving praise for our good fortune, or commemorating a special occasion. Though this is the only mainstream book on the Psalms written by a rabbi, the book is for people of all spiritual traditions-Jews, Christians, and people of any tradition who want to tap into the healing power of the Psalms.    Joshua O. Haberman (Washington, DC) is President of the Foundation for Jewish Studies. The former Senior Rabbi at the Washington Hebrew Congregation, he has preached at the White House and at the nationally televised memorial service to honor victims of 9/11.

Fukushima is known as a master koan trainer and calligrapher whose penetrating insight has awakened many disciples to an awareness of Zen. Roshi Keido Fukushima is the current Abbot of Tofukuji temple-monastery in Kyoto, Japan.  Combining the central teachings of Roshi Fukushima’s Zen with illuminating biographical details, Harris’ book serves both as a wonderfully fresh introduction to Zen for Western readers and a compelling biography which never fails to convey the radiant spirit of one of the most remarkable spiritual masters of our time.

H.L. Mencken coined the term ""the Bible Belt"" in the 1920s to capture the peculiar alliance of religion and public life in the South, but the reality he described was only the closing chapter of a long historical process. Into the twentieth century, a robust anticlerical tradition still challenged religious forays into southern politics. Inside southern churches, an insular evangelical theology looked suspiciously on political meddling. Outside of the churches, a popular anticlericalism indicted activist ministers with breaching the boundaries of their proper spheres of influence, calling up historical memories of the Dark Ages and Puritan witch hunts. Through the politics of prohibition, and in the face of bitter resistance, a complex but shared commitment to expanding the power and scope of religion transformed southern evangelicals' inward-looking restraints into an aggressive, self-assertive, and unapologetic political activism. The decades-long religious crusade to close saloons and outlaw alcohol in the South absorbed the energies of southern churches and thrust religious leaders headlong into the political process--even as their forays into southern politics were challenged at every step. Early defeats impelled prohibitionist clergy to recast their campaign as a broader effort not merely to dry up the South, but to conquer anticlerical opposition and inject religion into public life. Clerical activists churned notions of history, race, gender, and religion into a powerful political movement and elevated ambitious leaders such as the pugnacious fundamentalist J. Frank Norris and Senator Morris Sheppard, the ""Father of National Prohibition."" Exploring the controversies surrounding the religious support of prohibition in Texas, Making the Bible Belt reconstructs the purposeful, decades-long campaign to politicize southern religion, hints at the historical origins of the religious right, and explores a compelling and transformative moment in American history. - Publisher.

They explore the spiritual dimensions of ontology, considering the relationship between ontology and the political in light of the thought of figures ranging from Plato to Marx, Levinas to Derrida, and Augustine to Lacan. Together, the contributors challenge the belief that meaningful action is simply the successful assertion of will, that politics is ultimately reducible to “might makes right.” From a variety of perspectives, they suggest that grounding human action and politics in materialist critique offers revolutionary possibilities that transcend the nihilism inherent in both contemporary liberal democratic theory and neoconservative ideology.

George Brandon examines the religion’s transatlantic route through Cuban Santeria, Puerto Rican Espiritismo, and Black Nationalism. In following the historical and anthropological evolution of the Yoruba religion, Brandon discusses broader questions of power, multiculturalism, cultural change, and the production and reproduction of African retentions.

Adornos (1903–1969) nach. Der Frankfurter Gesellschaftskritiker griff im Rahmen seines radikalen materialistischen Projekts gleichwohl auch auf ‚theologische‘ Deutungsfiguren zurück. Vermittelt durch den gemeinsamen Freund Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) stieß Adorno dabei auf das Werk des Kabbala-Forschers Gershom Scholem (1897–1982). Zwischen Frankfurt und Jerusalem entwickelte sich eine lebenslange Korrespondenz.  Für Adorno erscheint vor dem Hintergrund lückenloser kapitalistischer Vergesellschaftung jede religiöse Sinngebung in der Moderne als unmöglich. Der Tradition der jüdischen Mystik schreibt er hingegen eine innere Affinität zu dieser hoffnungslosen Logik des ‚Verfalls‘ zu. Sie scheint ihm zur unumgänglichen Säkularisierung religiöser Gehalte aufzufordern. Adornos kabbalistische Marginalien beziehen einen breiten Horizont jüdisch-messianischer Ideen ein. Er verleugnet dabei nie, dass es ihm um eine sehr diesseite Verwirklichung geoffenbarter Heilsversprechen zu tun ist: Transzendenz sei als erfüllte Immanenz, als verwirklichte Utopie zu denken. In diesem Anliegen sieht Adorno selbst jedoch gerade seine Übereinstimmung mit der Kabbala.  Adornos kabbalistische Motive, die auf Scholems Forschungen zurückgehen, werden hier ausführlich an seinen Schriften und Vorlesungen untersucht. In seinem Verständnis der philosophischen Tradition sowie im Modell der Metaphysischen Erfahrung suchte er etwa explizit Anschluss an Deutungen der Kabbala: Das unerreichbare Urbild der Philosophie sei die Interpretation der geoffenbarten Schrift. Wie säkularisierte heilige Texte wurden Werke von Beethoven, Goethe, Kafka oder Schönberg so zum Anlass für ‚mystische‘ Interpretationen. Deren detaillierte Untersuchung erlaubt, das viel beschworene jüdische Erbe von Adornos Philosophie zu konkretisieren und bedenkenswerte Einzelheiten von der Negativen Dialektik zur Ästhetik in den Blick zu nehmen.

Eerdmans Pub. Co.|Language English,"Tolerance currently occupies a very high place in Western societies: it is considered gauche, even boorish, to question it. In The Intolerance of Tolerance, however, questioning tolerance -- or, at least, contemporary understandings of tolerance -- is exactly what D. A. Carson does. Carson traces the subtle but enormous shift in the way we have come to understand tolerance over recent years -- from defending the rights of those who hold different beliefs to affirming all beliefs as equally valid and correct. He looks back at the history of this shift and discusses its implications for culture today, especially its bearing on democracy, discussions about good and evil, and Christian truth claims. Using real-life examples that will sometimes arouse laughter and sometimes make the blood boil, Carson argues not only that the ""new tolerance"" is socially dangerous and intellectually debilitating but also that it actually leads to genuine intolerance of all who struggle to hold fast to their beliefs. ""In these highly contentious times we need a renewed understanding of the meaning of true tolerance. True tolerance means taking our deeply held convictions seriously because understanding our differences actually makes a difference. Disagreements matter. True tolerance means engaging one another with civility and respect despite our differences. It is not incompatible with firm convictions or the desire to persuade others. In this timely book D. A. Carson argues that today true tolerance is not well tolerated. He makes a passionate plea for a recovery of an older form of tolerance, insisting that the existence of disparate views is vastly different from the acceptance of all views being equally valid. Important matters are at stake here, and Carson cogently explains why they are so urgent."" - Michael Cromartie - Jacket flap.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Keller,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL2674786W?edition=ia%3Aprodigalgodrecov0000kell,/authors/OL390283A/Timothy_J._Keller,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16973186M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Penguin Group/Dutton,              Dutton Adult|Language English","The Prayer of Jabez used a little-known story of the Bible to redefine success for Christians. The Prodigal God uses a famous story of the Bible to redefine nothing less than the central Christian message for believers and skeptics alike.Newsweek called renowned minister Timothy Keller “a C. S. Lewis for the twenty-first century” in a feature on his first book, The Reason for God. In that book, he offered a rational explanation of why we should believe in God. Now, in The Prodigal God, he uses one of the best-known Christian parables to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation.The Prodigal Son is the most well-known parable in the Bible. Incredibly, it is also almost universally misunderstood. Taking his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity, Keller uncovers the essential message of Jesus, hidden in plain sight for centuries. Within this parable is the lost message of Jesus—where he outlines just how his followers are supposed to love and accept one another so they can join him in Heaven. With this book, both the devout and skeptics will see Christianity in a whole new way.   Read more Read less",12 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

This series of interconnected essays and lectures surveys the most critically important and hotly contested issues in Hinduism over 3,500 years, from the ancient time of the Vedas to the present day. The essays contemplate the nature of Hinduism; Hindu concepts of divinity; attitudes concerning gender, control, and desire; the question of reality and illusion; and the impermanent and the eternal in the two great Sanskrit epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Among the questions Doniger considers are: Are Hindus monotheists or polytheists? How can atheists be Hindu, and how can unrepentant Hindu sinners find salvation? Why have Hindus devoted so much attention to the psychology of addiction? What does the significance of dogs and cows tell us about Hinduism? How have Hindu concepts of death, rebirth, and karma changed over the course of history? How and why does a pluralistic faith, remarkable for its intellectual tolerance, foster religious intolerance? Doniger concludes with four concise autobiographical essays in which she reflects on her lifetime of scholarship, Hindu criticism of her work, and the influence of Hinduism on her own philosophy of life. On Hinduism is the culmination of over forty years of scholarship from a renowned expert on one of the world's great faiths""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In Saying Kaddish, she shows how to make Judaism's time-honored rituals into personal, meaningful sources of comfort. Diamant guides the reader through Jewish practices that attend the end of life, from the sickroom to the funeral to the week, month, and year that follow. There are chapters describing the traditional Jewish funeral and the customs of Shiva, the first week after death when mourners are comforted and cared for by community, friends, and family. She also explains the protected status of Jewish mourners, who are exempt from responsibilities of social, business, and religious life during Shloshim, the first thirty days. And she provides detailed instructions for the rituals of Yizkor and Yahrzeit, as well as chapters about caring for grieving children, mourning the death of a child, neonatal loss, suicide, and the death of non-Jewish loved ones.From the Trade Paperback edition.

For Frederick Buechner, the meaning of home is twofold: the home we remember and the home we dream. As a word, it not only recalls the place that we grew up in and that had much to do with the people we eventually became, but also points ahead to the home that, in faith, we believe awaits us at life's end. Writing at the approach of his seventieth birthday, he describes, both in prose and in a group of poems, the one particular house that was most precious to him as a child, the books he read there, and the people he loved there. He speaks also of the lifelong search we are all engaged in to make a new home for ourselves and for our families, which is at the same time a search to find something like the wholeness and comfort of home with ourselves. As he turns his attention to our dreams of the heavenly home still to come, he sees it as both hallowing and fulfilling the charity and the peach of our original home. Writing with warmth, wisdom, and compelling eloquence, Frederick Buechner once again enables us to see more deeply into the secret places of our hearts. The Longing for Home will help to bring clarity and guidance to anyone who searches for meaning in a world that all too often seems meaningless.

Fletcher argues that though there were trading and cultural interactions between Islam and Christianity during the period when Arabs controlled most of the Mediterranean world, neither side was remotely interested in the religion of the other. ""Christian and Moslem lived side by side in a state of mutual religious aversion. Given these circumstances, if religious passions were to be stirred up, confrontation would probably be violent."" He shows how religious misunderstanding and antagonism between ""the peoples of the book"" has been present since their earliest encounters.

Religion, once a neglected topic in migration studies, is today seen as a crucially important aspect of the immigrant experience. For some - particularly those focusing on religion in North America - religion has been portrayed as a vital resource for many immigrants engaged in the essential identity work required in adjusting to the receiving society. For others - particularly those who have focused on Muslim immigrants in Western Europe - religion tends to be depicted as a source of conflict rather than one of comfort and consolation. -- Publisher description.

Défenseur d'une éthique de la discussion, il a lui-même sans cesse poursuivi un dialogue avec des théoriciens de divers horizons. Ces dernières décennies, il a accordé une attention toute particulière à la démocratie et à la religion. C'est à partir de sa réflexion sur ces thèmes, mais aussi d'écrits d'autres penseurs, que l'auteur dégage un cadre théorique et normatif permettant de penser la place et le rôle de la religion dans les démocraties libérales d'aujourd'hui. Le pluralisme des valeurs et des convictions étant devenu une caractéristique de notre époque, il importe en effet d'aménager celui-ci de manière juste. Cherchant à éviter les écueils du laïcisme et du communautarisme, l'auteur mobilise ici la philosophie morale et politique contemporaine, en particulier les travaux de Jürgen Habermas, pour définir les principes constitutifs et les conditions de réalisation d'une laïcité bien comprise .

Are we evolutionarily programmed to have such experiences? How will emerging technologies change such experiences in the future? Wesley Wildman addresses these key intellectual questions and more, offering a spiritually evocative naturalist interpretation of the diverse variety of religious and spiritual experiences. He describes these experiences, from the common to the exceptional, and offers innovative classifications for them based on their neurological features and internal qualities. His account avoids reductionalistic oversimplifications and instead synthesizes perspectives from many disciplines, including philosophy and natural sciences, into a compelling account of the meaning and value of religious and spiritual experiences in human life. The resulting interpretation does not assume a supernatural worldview nor does it reject such experiences as positive affirmation of this-worldly existence""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Today, however, it is sometimes assumed that Islam is a foreign element inside the West, and even that Islam and the West are doomed to be in perpetual conflict. The need for accurate, reliable scholarship on this topic has never been more urgent. The Bloomsbury Reader on Islam in the West brings together some of the most important, up-to-date scholarly writings published on this subject. The Reader explores not only the presence of Muslim religious practitioners in Europe and the Americas but also the impact of Islamic ideas and Muslims on Western politics, societies, and cultures. It is ideal for use in the university classroom, with an extensive introduction by Edward E. Curtis IV and a timeline of key events in the history of Islam in the West. A brief introduction to the author and the topic is provided at the start of each excerpt. Part 1, on the history of Islam in the West, probes the role of Muslims and the significance of Islam in medieval, early modern, and modern settings such as Islamic Spain, colonial-era Latin America, sixteenth-century France, nineteenth-century Crimea, interwar Albania, the post-World War II United States, and late twentieth-century Germany. Part 2 focuses on the contemporary West, examining debates over Muslim citizenship, the war on terrorism, anti-Muslim prejudice, and Islam and gender, while also providing readers with a concrete sense of how Muslims practise and live out Islamic ideals in their private and public lives""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Finley, Margarita Simon Guillory, and Hugh R. Page, Jr. assemble twenty groundbreaking essays that provide a rationale and parameters for Africana Esoteric Studies (AES): a new trans-disciplinary enterprise focused on the investigation of esoteric lore and practices in Africa and the African Diaspora. The goals of this new field --- while akin to those of Religious Studies, Africana Studies, and Western Esoteric Studies --- are focused on the impulses that give rise to Africana Esoteric Traditions (AETs) and the ways in which they can be understood as loci where issues such as race, ethnicity, and identity are engaged; and in which identity, embodiment, resistance, and meaning are negotiated.

But this handbook offers more than that. It includes women who until recently have been lost to memory even within their own communities and makes it impossible to ignore the prodigious extent to which women participated creatively in their traditions. Implicitly it argues the case that American religious history will be written with sufficient depth and sophistication only if and when it includes thoroughly integrated attention to women.  - Mary Farrell Bednarowski, Emerita Professor of Religious Studies, United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cites, on back cover.

The Dalai Lama deftly connects how training the mind in compassion for other beings is directly related to--and in fact a prerequisite for--the very pinnacle of Buddhist meditation.  He presents his understanding, confirmed again and again over millennia, that the cultivation of both compassion and wisdom is absolutely critical to progress in meditation and goes into great depth on how this can be accomplished. While accessible to a beginner, he leads the reader in very fine detail on how to identify innermost awareness--who we really are--how to maintain contact with this awareness, and how to release oneself from the endless stream of our thoughts to let this awareness, always present, become consistently apparent""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this engaging and informative book, Thomas David DuBois sets out to explain how religious traditions and philosophies in China and Japan have evolved and intersected since the birth of Confucianism in China and the arrival of Buddhism in Japan. Crossing a broad terrain from Tokyo to Tibet, the book concentrates on the post-fourteenth century, when the long-lasting political dynasties that transformed the political, social, and economic institutions of both countries came into being. It is these connections that the author is keen to highlight, and he does so to effect by using key moments, such as the Taiping Uprising and the Boxer Rebellion, to underscore the importance of religion in transforming the course of Asian history. Contemporary chapters reflect on the wartime deification of the Japanese emperor, Marxism as religion, and the persecution of the Dalai Lama""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
A short history of global evangelicalism,Mark Hutchinson,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16564263W,/authors/OL7099600A/Mark_Hutchinson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""This book offers an authoritative overview of the history of evangelicalism as a global movement, from its origins in Europe and North America in the first half of the eighteenth century to its present-day dynamic growth in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. Starting with a definition of the movement within the context of the history of Protestantism, it follows the history of evangelicalism from its early North Atlantic revivals to the great expansion in the Victorian era, through to its fracturing and reorientation in response to the stresses of modernity and total war in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It describes the movement's indigenization and expansion toward becoming a multicentered and diverse movement at home in the non-Western world that nevertheless retains continuity with its historic roots. The book concludes with an analysis of contemporary worldwide evangelicalism's current trajectory and the movement's adaptability to changing historical and geographical circumstances""--  ""In October 1757, Thomas Haweis, a young Cornishman, was ordained to the curacy of St Mary Magdalen church in Oxford. Haweis's ministry rapidly stirred strong reactions. According to Charles Wesley, a co-founder of Methodism, he preached 'Christ crucified, with amazing success,' and drew large crowds both from the University and the city. On the other hand, students jeered Haweis in the street, shouting 'There goes the saver of souls!': stones were thrown through the church windows while he was preaching, and 'This is the back way to Hell' was chalked on the church doors. More orderly, but ultimately more effective, critics eventually forced Haweis to leave Oxford in 1762. Not to be repressed, Haweis subsequently published a selection of the sermons he had delivered in Oxford under the overall title of Evangelical Principles and Practice. It was one of earliest attempts systematically to set out the theological outlook of the developing evangelical movement and its implications for Christian devotion and practice. Haweis's starting point was 'The Divinity of the SON and SPIRIT, co-eternal and co-equal with the FATHER'. He affirmed 'the inability of man in his fallen state to do any thing but evil' and the impossibility of human compliance with God's Law""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Drawing on her own experience and lifelong reading practice, Ladin shows how the Torah, a collection of ancient texts that assume human beings are either male or female, speaks both to practical transgender concerns, such as marginalization, and to the challenges of living without a body or social role that renders one intelligible to others―challenges that can help us understand a God who defies all human categories. These creative, evocative readings transform our understanding of the Torah’s portrayals of God, humanity, and relationships between them.

They challenged the notion of our God-given centrality within the universe and within earth's evolutionary history. Yet as our continuing exploitation of earth's resources and species demonstrates, we remain wedded to the theological assumption that these are there for our sole use and benefit. Now James Lovelock's scientific understanding of the existential reality of Gaia's gift of life again raises the question of our proper place within the universe. It turns us decisively towards an understanding of ourselves as dependent on, rather than in control of, the whole earth community.

Worship and the parish church in early modern Britain,Natalie Mears,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL20955599W,/authors/OL2771574A/Natalie_Mears,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28389719M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Ashgate|Language English|Pages 250,"""The parish church was the primary site of religious practice throughout the early modern period. This was particularly so for the silent majority of the English population, who conformed outwardly to the successive religious upheavals of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. What such public conformity might have meant has attracted less attention-- and ironically, is sometimes less well-documented--than the non-conformity or semi-conformity of recusants, church-papists, Puritan conventiclers or separatists. In this volume, ten leading scholars of early modern religion explore the experience of parish worship in England and Scotland during the Reformation and the century that followed it. As contributors argue, parish worship in this period was of critical theological, cultural and even political importance""--Book jacket.

From the British Library to the Mohegan Sun casino, from the nation’s first synagogue to a Mayflower waterslide, Vowell studies the Puritan effect and finds their beliefs about church and state more interesting than their buckles-and-corn reputation would suggest.She asks:Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity’s tyrannical enforcer? Yes! Was Rhode Island’s architect Roger Williams America’s founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? Same difference. How come Henry Vane the Younger, who argued against beheading the English king, was himself beheaded for helping behead said king? Good question. What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? A hatchet. What was the Puritans’ pet name for the Pope? The Great Whore of Babylon. What is the lesson of the Pequot War? Why, don’t fire one of your military’s embarrassingly few Arabic translators just because he’s gay, of course.As in all Vowell’s bestselling books, this exploration of America’s past is both poignant and entertaining. The Wordy Shipmates is rich with historical fact, humorous insight, and social commentary by one of America’s celebrated voices.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|4 Have read

The project grew out of a three-year inquiry into religious institutions undertaken by Yale University's Program on Non-Profit Organizations andsponsored by the Lilly Endowment.

Diese sind wesentlich differenzierter, als es durch das klassisch gewordene religionstheologische Dreierschema von Exklusivismus, Inklusivismus und Pluralismus erfasst werden kann. Vielmehr geht es um eine komplexe Konstellation ineinander verschränkter Innen-Aussen-Relationen, die sich auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen wiederholen und einander bedingen. Diese Struktur zu analysieren und auf ihre religionstheologischen Konsequenzen hin zu befragen, ist das zentrale Interesse der Autorin. Ihr dient der differenztheoretische Ansatz der Systemtheorie Niklas Luhmanns als analytisches Instrumentarium; ausserdem werden zur Weiterführung der Argumentation phänomenologische Denkfiguren herangezogen, die den Arbeiten von Bernhard Waldenfels entnommen sind.""

Selected religion titles from nineteenth century American literature and history,,religion,First published in 1793,/works/OL32861598W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1793|Publisher  [publisher not identified]|Language English|Pages 39,"Nearly fifty titles were selected from the literature of the frontier Ohio Valley and the South to illuminate religious and church history in these regions during the nineteenth century. When speaking of this history, Sydney Ahlstrom, in A Religious History of the American People, cautioned that ""far more remarkable than the primitive and rudimentary aspects of frontier religion was the persistence with which the thought, institutions, and practice of Europe and the settled East crossed the mountains and penetrated the life of the newly settled areas"" (p. 453). The first half of the century was characterized by the revival spirit generated at the 1800 camp meeting organized by at the Gasper River Church in southwestern Kentucky and the 1801 outpouring of religious excitement at Cane Ridge in Bourbon County, Kentucky. Revivalism spurred the sensational growth of popular denominations such as the Methodists and the Baptists in the West. The Presbyterians did not sustain such rapid growth but were the first group to begin working beyond the Alleghenies. Their vigorous efforts to adapt to frontier conditions led to divisions, including that led by the minister Barton Stone. Other adaptations included the project of Alexander Campbell to undo denominationalism. Central and western New York was the proving ground for expanding Congregationalism and Presbyterianism. The new voluntary organizations born in the evangelical fire of the period, such as the American Home Missionary Society, brought the influence of New England religion to the frontier. In the last half of the century, the issue of slavery would divide denominations, North and South. The titles included here demonstrate the variety of forms in which spiritual conversation shaped the culture beyond the Alleghenies. The poetry of Sandford C. Cox and Anthony Hunn, the hymns of Allen D. Carden and William Downs, and the ballads of Alice Cary can be examined for what they reveal about religion outside of the East. The memoir Ten Years of Preacher-Life tells the story of the blind preacher William Henry Milburn, whose early ministry involved traveling by horseback around the Midwest as a Methodist circuit rider. Theological debates that originated or affected religious life in the Ohio Valley and the South were published and circulated. Included are works on the doctrine of grace and universal atonement, Arianism, the final perseverance of the saints, and the doctrine of the Trinity. Important nineteenth-century histories of Western Methodism and Shakerism are found alongside general commentaries on spiritual matters by important academics based west of the Alleghenies. The first Roman Catholic bishop of Peoria, Illinois, John Lancaster Spalding, is represented with numerous titles on religion, art, and education. An additional grouping of works give a representative sampling of pieces on morals by authors associated with influential voluntary associations or the medical profession. Finally, the collection offers a fine selection of primary sources on the passionate debates involving church, slavery, and morality. These include numerous titles by the important abolitionist James Gillespie Birney. Overall, this collection provides a particularly useful sampling of the literature of various denominations, the theological and political issues, and the modes of religious expression found in the Ohio Valley and the South during the nineteenth century.

When she finds a golden necklace, she is intrigued by its shape and shows it to her grandfather, the Great Wise Horned Owl of the Park. His reaction only stirs her interest even more; he calls it a holy symbol, and then a 't' for 'trouble'! All of which sets our young owl off on a Quest to learn its true meaning. Little does she know that a day-dreaming, over-protected, adventure-seeking Pirate - er, mouse - named Timley has leapt into the brim of her hat as Sophie flies off on her Quest! And suddenly, their adventure takes its own turn as they find themselves on board a ship bound for the Holy Land. Thorns and thistles! Has the trouble started already? Can Timley convince Sophie she should not-I repeat, NOT-eat him? This is also the story of the mysterious Sky Painter, who seems to be with them-no, leading them-on their Quest. So, why is he always leading them straight into trouble? Was the Great Wise Horned Owl right all along? Come along on the Quest to find out! Cross oceans with Sophie and Timley to a land of mosques and synagogues, markets and Bedouin tents, and, like our unlikely friends, you may never be the same again!

The response of the scientist Francis Collins is blunt: yes. The belief in God may be an entirely rational choice and the principles of faith are complementary with the principles of science. Science can explain the origin and evolution of mankind, but issues such as what the meaning of human life, what happens after they die are the questions that can not respond. With clear language and an enjoyable way Francis Collins introduces us to this exciting and controversial debate between science and religion.  En esta era moderna, de cosmología, evolución y genoma humano, ¿existe aún la posibilidad de encontrar una armonía satisfactoria entre las concepciones científica y espiritual del mundo? La respuesta del científico Francis Collins es contundente: sí. La creencia en Dios puede ser una elección enteramente racional y los principios de la fe son complementarios a los principios de la ciencia. La ciencia puede explicar el origen y la evolución de la humanidad, pero cuestiones como cúal es el significado de la vida humana, qué sucede después de que morimos son las preguntas a las que no puede responder.

Its mere utterance conjures up images of car bombs exploding in crowded markets; Boeing 737s crashing into tall buildings; and flag-burning, gun-toting bearded Arab men shouting, ""allahu akbar"" and ""Death to America!"" But what if all our stereotypical images of jihad are wrong, and when rightly understood, jihad turns out to be the perfect lens through which to understand the life and mission of Jesus? Jesus and Jihad argues that in early Muslim sources jihad stood for the struggle to transform a violent and unjust pre-Islamic society into one characterized by greater levels of justice and peace. When rescued from his Christian pietistic misinterpretations, Jesus emerges as a highly prophetic figure of resistance to the injustices authorized by Roman imperial power. As Muslims reengage an authentic understanding of jihad, and Christians, through a renewed understanding of jihad, meet the prophetic Jesus from whom they have become estranged, a new era of Christian-Muslim cooperation in the struggle against injustice can become the norm, replacing the current antipathy dividing these communities with a passion to reclaim once again a prophetic heart in service to a hurting world.

But one cannot understand American religion without understanding the congregation. Volume 1: Portraits of Twelve Religious Communities chronicles the founding, growth, and development of congregations that represent the diverse and complex reality of American local religious cultures. The contributors explore multiple issues, from the fate of American Protestantism to the rise of charismatic revivalism. Volume 2: New Perspectives in the Study of Congregations builds upon those historical studies, and addresses three crucial questions: Where is the congregation located on the broader map of American cultural and religious life? What are congregations' distinctive qualities, tasks, and roles in American culture? And, what patterns of leadership characterize congregations in America?

Youth Ministry,Malan Nel,religion,,/works/OL20927958W,/authors/OL1891713A/Malan_Nel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  AOSIS|Language English|Pages 442,"This book aims at contributing to the scientific and academic discourse as regards to the ?what? and ?why? of youth ministry. Too often, youth ministry has been approached from a mainly practical point of view, almost asking how we keep young people off the streets. Its methodology has often not included the theological and theoretical presuppositions that lie behind this ministry. Previous scientific reflection has been determined by a one-dimensional and almost exclusive point of view. In comparison with existing literature, this book does not focus so much on the ?how? of youth ministry. It innovates a different approach. The book challenges the existing exclusive approach and develops an inclusive, congregational and missional understanding of and approach to youth ministry.From a particular perspective on the understanding the main objectives of Practical Theology, the author endorses the so-called movement of ?what is supposed to be going on?. He adds the outcome of an empirical round table discussion with some 16 leaders in this field on the descriptive and interpretive movements within the subject field: what is going on and why is it going on? The book will form the standard for any new research with regard to youth ministry. The book?s contribution lies on the level of sound theological reasoning and argumentation (supported by many scholars) for an inclusive congregational understanding of ministry as an integral part of every congregation being missional in being and doing. Youth, children, adolescents and emerging adults, are just as integral a part of every congregation within which they live and serve.
