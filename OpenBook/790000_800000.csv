Modular Representation Theory of Finite Groups,Peter Schneider,mathematics,First published in 2012,/works/OL19888973W?edition=ia%3Amodularrepresent00schn,/authors/OL139845A/Peter_Schneider,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27075707M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer London,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 178","Representation theory studies maps from groups into the general linear group of a finite-dimensional vector space. For finite groups the theory comes in two distinct flavours. In the 'semisimple case' (for example over the field of complex numbers) one can use character theory to completely understand the representations. This by far is not sufficient when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group.Modular representation theory of finite groups comprises this second situation. Many additional tools are needed for this case. To mention some, there is the systematic use of Grothendieck groups leading to the Cartan matrix and the decomposition matrix of the group as well as Green's direct analysis of indecomposable representations. There is also the strategy of writing the category of all representations as the direct product of certain subcategories, the so-called 'blocks' of the group.^ Brauer's work then establishes correspondences between the blocks of the original group and blocks of certain subgroups the philosophy being that one is thereby reduced to a simpler situation. In particular, one can measure how nonsemisimple a category a block is by the size and structure of its so-called 'defect group'. All these concepts are made explicit for the example of the special linear group of two-by-two matrices over a finite prime field.Although the presentation is strongly biased towards the module theoretic point of view an attempt is made to strike a certain balance by also showing the reader the group theoretic approach. In particular, in the case of defect groups a detailed proof of the equivalence of the two approaches is given. This book aims to familiarize students at the masters level with the basic results, tools, and techniques of a beautiful and important algebraic theory.^ Some basic algebra together with the semisimple case are assumed to be known, although all facts to be used are restated (without proofs) in the text. Otherwise the book is entirely self-contained.  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At the same time, the growing hardware capabilities of modern supercomputing architectures have caused an increasing complexity of the parallel application development. Despite numerous efforts to improve and simplify parallel programming, there is still a lot of manual debugging and  tuning work required. This process  is supported by special software tools, facilitating debugging, performance analysis, and optimization and thus  making a major contribution to the development of  robust and efficient parallel software.

A Bayesian Analysis of QCD Sum Rules,Philipp Gubler,mathematics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19830050W?edition=ia%3Abayesiananalysis00gubl,/authors/OL7357517A/Philipp_Gubler,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27020173M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Japan,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 190","The author develops a novel analysis method for QCD sum rules (QCDSR) by applying the maximum entropy method (MEM) to arrive at an analysis with less artificial assumptions than previously held. This is a first-time accomplishment in the field.In this thesis, a reformed MEM for QCDSR is formalized and is applied to the sum rules of several channels: the light-quark meson in the vector channel, the light-quark baryon channel with spin and isospin 1/2, and several quarkonium channels at both zero and finite temperatures. This novel technique of combining QCDSR with MEM is applied to the study of quarkonium in hot matter, which is an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma currently being created in heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC.

The application of such mathematical and computational tools requires a formal or explicit understanding of physiology. Formal models and analytical techniques are interlinked in physiology as in any other field. This book takes a unitary approach to physiological systems, beginning with signal measurement and acquisition, followed by signal processing, linear systems modelling, and computer simulations. The signal processing techniques range across filtering, spectral analysis and wavelet analysis. Emphasis is placed on fundamental understanding of the concepts as well as solving numerical problems. Graphs and analogies are used extensively to supplement the mathematics. Detailed models of nerve and muscle at the cellular and systemic levels provide examples for the mathematical methods and computer simulations. Several of the models are sufficiently sophisticated to be of value in understanding real world issues like neuromuscular disease. This second edition features expanded problem sets and a link to extra downloadable material.  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Leading authors reveal how contemporary technical results touch upon foundational questions about the nature of mathematics. Highlights of the volume include: a history of Tennenbaum's theorem in arithmetic; a number of papers on Tennenbaum phenomena in weak arithmetics as well as on other aspects of arithmetics, such as interpretability; the transcript of Gödel's previously unpublished 1972-1975 conversations with Sue Toledo, along with an appreciation of the same by Curtis Franks; Hugh Woodin's paper arguing against the generic multiverse view; Anne Troelstra's history of intuitionism through 1991; and Aki Kanamori's history of the Suslin problem in set theory. The book provides a historical and philosophical treatment of particular theorems in arithmetic and set theory, and is ideal for researchers and graduate students in mathematical logic and philosophy of mathematics""--  ""The papers collected here engage each of these questions through the veil of particular technical results. For example, the new proof of the irrationality of the square root of two, given by Stanley Tennenbaum in the 1960s and included here, brings into relief questions about the role simplicity plays in our grasp of mathematical proofs. In 1900 Hilbert asked a question which was not given at the Paris conference but which has been recently found in his notes for the list: find a criterion of simplicity in mathematics. The Tennenbaum proof is a particularly striking example of the phenomenon Hilbert contemplated in his 24th Problem""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The wind power forecast error distribution assumed can have a large impact on the confidence intervals produced in wind power forecasting. In this work we examine the shape of the persistence model error distribution for ten different wind plants in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system over multiple timescales. Comparisons are made between the experimental distribution shape and that of the normal distribution. The shape of the distribution is found to change significantly with the length of the forecasting timescale. The Cauchy distribution is proposed as a model distribution for the forecast errors and model parameters are fitted. Finally, the differences in confidence intervals obtained using the Cauchy distribution and the normal distribution are compared.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What determines the size distribution of firms? This paper presents a theory of firm dynamics that simultaneously rationalizes the basic facts on firm growth, exit, and size distributions.  The theory emphasizes the accumulation of industry specific human capital in response to industry specific productivity shocks.  The theory implies that firm growth and exit rates should decline faster with size, and the size distribution should have thinner tails, in sectors that use human capital less intensively, or correspondingly, physical capital more intensively.  In line with the theory, we document substantial sectoral heterogeneity in US firm dynamics and firm size distributions, which is well explained by variation in physical capital intensities""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

The underlying theory hinges on a new stability result, formulated in the abstract setting of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems, which states that under certain hypotheses, the omega-limit set of a perturbed dynamical system is stable under arbitrary asymptotically small perturbations. The Stability Theorem is examined in detail in the first chapter, followed by a review of basic results and methods---many original to the authors---for the solution of nonlinear diffusion equations. Further chapters provide a self-contained analysis of specific equations, with carefully-constructed theorems, proofs, and references. In addition to the derivation of interesting limiting behaviors, the book features a variety of estimation techniques for solutions of semi- and quasilinear parabolic equations. Written by established mathematicians at the forefront of the field, this work is a blend of delicate analysis and broad application, appropriate for graduate students and researchers in physics and mathematics who have basic knowledge of PDEs, ordinary differential equations, functional analysis, and some prior acquaintance with evolution equations. It is ideal for a course or seminar in evolution equations and asymptotics, and the book's comprehensive index and bibliography will make it useful as a reference volume as well.

It makes airline passengers return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts but it also creates drag on the aircraft that causes it to use more fuel and create more pollution. The same applies to cars, ships and the space shuttle. The mathematical theory of turbulence has been an unsolved problems for 500 years and the development of the statistical theory of the Navier-Stokes equations describes turbulent flow has been an open problem. The Kolmogorov-Obukhov Theory of Turbulence develops a statistical theory of turbulence from the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation and the physical theory, that was proposed by Kolmogorov and Obukhov in 1941. The statistical theory of turbulence shows that the noise in developed turbulence is a general form which can be used to present a mathematical model for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation. The statistical theory of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation is developed in a pedagogical manner and shown to imply the Kolmogorov-Obukhov statistical theory. This book looks at a new mathematical theory in turbulence which may lead to many new developments in vorticity and Lagrangian turbulence. But even more importantly it may produce a systematic way of improving direct Navier-Stokes simulations and lead to a major jump in the technology both preventing and utilizing turbulence.

In this context, modeling and optimization surface as basic ingredients for fruitful applications. This volume concentrates on the current methodology of copulas and maximum entropy optimization.This volume contains main research presentations at the Sixth International Conference of the Thailand Econometrics Society held at the Faculty of Economics, Chiang Mai University, Thailand, during January 10-11, 2013. It consists of keynote addresses, theoretical and applied contributions. These contributions to Econometrics are somewhat centered around the theme of Copulas and Maximum Entropy Econometrics. The method of copulas is applied to a variety of economic problems where multivariate model building and correlation analysis are needed. As for the art of choosing copulas in practical problems, the principle of maximum entropy surfaces as a potential way to do so. The state-of-the-art of Maximum Entropy Econometrics is presented in the first keynote address, while the second keynote address focusses on testing stationarity in economic time series data.

While the first part of the book contains mainstream material on the subject, the second and the third parts deal with more specialized topics, such as analysis in weight spaces with reflection invariant weight functions, and analysis on balls and simplexes.  The last part of the book features several applications, including cubature formulas, distribution of points on the sphere, and the reconstruction algorithm in computerized tomography.This book is directed at researchers and advanced graduate students in analysis. Mathematicians who are familiar with Fourier analysis and harmonic analysis will understand many of the concepts that appear in this manuscript: spherical harmonics, the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function, the Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem, the Riesz transform, and doubling weights are all familiar tools to researchers in this area.

In this thesis, we present a variable-fidelity framework that is mathematically robust. We then present the results on analytical test cases for the framework and variable-parameterization method, which involves using different design variables during the course of the optimization process. The framework and the variable-parameterization method are then used to perform airfoil shape optimization. The variable-fidelity framework performed satisfactorily for most cases while a thorough mathematical study is needed for the variable-parameterization method.

If you go up to a computer engineer -- someone who designs microprocessors or operating systems or network protocols or traffic light controllers -- and ask him the same question, you are likely to get an uncomprehending stare. No only will he not be able to answer but he will give the impression that the question itself is ill-posed: what has mathematics got to do with building computer systems? This paradoxical and worrying discrepancy presents mathematics with tremendous challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. The present note expands upon an invited contribution to a panel discussion at the Symposium on Current and Future Directions in Applied Mathematics, held at the University of Notre Dame from 18-21 April 1996.""

Classical Banach Spaces I,Joram Lindenstrauss,mathematics,First published in 1977,/works/OL31657122W,/authors/OL6252282A/Joram_Lindenstrauss,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1977|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Language English,"The appearance of Banach's book [8] in 1932 signified the beginning of a syste­ matic study of normed linear spaces, which have been the subject of continuous research ever since. In the sixties, and especially in the last decade, the research activity in this area grew considerably. As a result, Ban:ach space theory gained very much in depth as well as in scope: Most of its well known classical problems were solved, many interesting new directions were developed, and deep connections between Banach space theory and other areas of mathematics were established. The purpose of this book is to present the main results and current research directions in the geometry of Banach spaces, with an emphasis on the study of the structure of the classical Banach spaces, that is C(K) and Lip.) and related spaces. We did not attempt to write a comprehensive survey of Banach space theory, or even only of the theory of classical Banach spaces, since the amount of interesting results on the subject makes such a survey practically impossible.

If we are working over an arbitrary commutative ring rather than a field, the categories of representations cease to be abelian. We provide a list of sufficient conditions which ensure that an additive tensor category is equivalent to the category of representations of an affine groupoid scheme acting on an affine scheme, or, more generally, to the category of representations of a Hopf algebroid in a symmetric monoidal category. In order to do this we develop a ""formal theory of Tannaka duality"" inspired by Ross Street's ""formal theory of monads."" We apply our results to certain categories of filtered modules which are used to study p-adic Galois representations.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this seminar, scientists from industry presented industrial problems to mathematicians, including the mathematical formulation of the problems. The book consists of twenty-two chapters, each one being independent of the others. Each chapter is based on a presentation by one of the speakers; it includes the industrial background, relevant mathematical literature, a list of open mathematical problems and, in some cases, reference to a solution or a partial solution of the problem. Most of the problems, however, are still open and they are addressed to mathematicians. The topics of the book include scattering, control and coding, conservation laws, inverse problems, network optimization, fluid problems, and a variety of free boundary problems in fluid mechanics. The book will be of interest to mathematicians seeking to work on mathematical problems which arise in industry. It will also be of interest to mathematicians and scientists who would like to learn about the interaction between mathematics and industry, what type of problems arise, how they are modelled, etc. Scientists working in industry may also be interested in the book as they discover that some of the topics dealt with are connected to their own work.

The book is more than a collection of articles. In fact, in it the reader will find a consistent editorial work, devoted to attempting to obtain a unitary picture from the different contributions and to give a comprehensive account of important recent developments in contemporary white noise analysis and some of its applications. For this reason, not only the latest results, but also motivations, explanations and connections with previous work have been included. The wealth of applications, from number theory to signal processing, from optimal filtering to information theory, from the statistics of stationary flows to quantum cable equations, show the power of white noise analysis as a tool. Beyond these, the authors emphasize its connections with practically all branches of contemporary probability, including stochastic geometry, the structure theory of stationary Gaussian processes, Neumann boundary value problems, and large deviations.

Two major sources of the book are the stock of classic models and the authors' wide experience in the field. The book provides a theoretical background to guide the development of practical models and their investigation. It considers general modelling techniques, explains basic underlying physical laws and shows how to transform them into a set of mathematical equations. The emphasis is placed on common features of the modelling process in various applications as well as on complications and generalizations of models. The book covers a variety of applications: mechanical, acoustical, physical and electrical, water transportation and contamination processes; bioengineering and population control; production systems and technical equipment renovation. Mathematical tools include partial and ordinary differential equations, difference and integral equations, the calculus of variations, optimal control, bifurcation methods, and related subjects.

The text emphasizes eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and Green's functions. Prerequisites include differential equations and a first course in theoretical physics. The three-part presentation begins with an exploration of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom (described by matrices). In part two, the concepts developed for discrete systems in previous chapters are extended to continuous systems. New concepts useful in the treatment of continuous systems are also introduced. The final part examines approximation methods -- including perturbation theory, variational methods, and numerical methods -- relevant to addressing most of the problems of nature that confront applied physicists.

Während der Vorbereitung gab es eine besonders intensive Zusammenarbeit mit einer Gruppe von Studierenden; alles, was ihrer Meinung nach zum besseren Verständnis hätte gesagt werden können, ist aufgenommen worden. Das Buch enthält viele Übungsaufgaben, deren ausführliche Lösungen als Online-Service zum Buch auf der speziell dafür eingerichteten Internetseite zu finden sind. Das Buch ist auch zum Selbststudium geeignet. Schon im Text gibt es zahlreiche Fragen zum Mitdenken, und nach jedem Kapitel findet man - für spätere Prüfungsvorbereitungen - eine Sammlung von Verständnisfragen.

In particular, there have been important advances in understanding the infinitesimal versus global behavior of Lipschitz functions and quasiconformal mappings in rather general settings; abstract Sobolev space theories have been instrumental in this development. The purpose of this book is to communicate some of the recent work in the area while preparing the reader to study more substantial, related articles. The material can be roughly divided into three different types: classical, standard but sometimes with a new twist, and recent. The author first studies basic covering theorems and their applications to analysis in metric measure spaces. This is followed by a discussion on Sobolev spaces emphasizing principles that are valid in larger contexts. The last few sections of the book present a basic theory of quasisymmetric maps between metric spaces. Much of the material is relatively recent and appears for the first time in book format. There are plenty of exercises. The book is well suited for self-study, or as a text in a graduate course or seminar. The material is relevant to anyone who is interested in analysis and geometry in nonsmooth settings.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Scheduling of Resource-Constrained Projects,Robert Klein,mathematics,First published in 2000,/works/OL19900809W?edition=ia%3Aschedulingresour00klei,/authors/OL2634262A/Robert_Klein,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27086407M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2000|Publisher  Springer US|Language English|Pages 369,"Project management has become a widespread instrument enabling organizations to efficiently master the challenges of steadily shortening product life cycles, global markets and decreasing profit margins. With projects increasing in size and complexity, their planning and control represents one of the most crucial management tasks. This is especially true for scheduling, which is concerned with establishing execution dates for the sub-activities to be performed in order to complete the project. The ability to manage projects where resources must be allocated between concurrent projects or even sub-activities of a single project requires the use of commercial project management software packages. However, the results yielded by the solution procedures included are often rather unsatisfactory. Scheduling of Resource-Constrained Projects develops more efficient procedures, which can easily be integrated into software packages by incorporated programming languages, and thus should be of great interest for practitioners as well as scientists working in the field of project management. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I, the project management process is described and the management tasks to be accomplished during project planning and control are discussed. This allows for identifying the major scheduling problems arising in the planning process, among which the resource-constrained project scheduling problem is the most important. Part II deals with efficient computer-based procedures for the resource-constrained project scheduling problem and its generalized version. Since both problems are NP-hard, the development of such procedures which yield satisfactory solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time is very challenging, and a number of new and very promising approaches are introduced. This includes heuristic procedures based on priority rules and tabu search as well as lower bound methods and branch and bound procedures which can be applied for computing optimal solutions.

These workshops brought together mathematicians, engineers and scientists to summarize recent theoretical, computational, and experimental advances in the theory of phenomena in porous media. The first workshop focused on the mathematical problems which arise in groundwater transport of contamination, and the spreading, confinement and remediation of biological, chemical and radioactive waste. In the second conference, the processes underlying petroleum recovery and the geological time scale of deformation, flow and reaction in porous media were discussed. Simulation techniques were used to simulate complex domains with widely-ranging spatial resolution and types of physics. Probability funcional methods for determining the most probable state of the subsurface and related uncertainty were discussed. Practical examples included breakout from chemical and radioactive waste repositories, confinement by injection of pore plugging material and bioremediation of petroleum and other wastes. This volume will be of interest to subsurface science practitioners who would like a view of recent mathematical and experimental efforts to examine subsurface science phenomena related to resource recovery and remediation issues.

Students will develop problem-solving skills through hundreds of worked examples, self-test questions and homework problems. Each chapter concludes with a summary of the main procedures and results and all assumed prior knowledge is summarized in one of the appendices. Over 300 worked examples show how to use the techniques and around 100 self-test questions in the footnotes act as checkpoints to build student confidence. Nearly 400 end-of-chapter problems combine ideas from the chapter to reinforce the concepts. Hints and outline answers to the odd-numbered problems are given at the end of each chapter, with fully-worked solutions to these problems given in the accompanying Student Solutions Manual. Fully-worked solutions to all problems, password-protected for instructors, are available at www.cambridge.org/essential""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Control,Huaguang Zhang,mathematics,First published in 2012,/works/OL19823731W?edition=ia%3Aadaptivedynamicp00zhan,/authors/OL2856050A/Huaguang_Zhang,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27014402M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer London,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 424","There are many methods of stable controller design for nonlinear systems. In seeking to go beyond the minimum requirement of stability, Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Control approaches the challenging topic of optimal control for nonlinear systems using the tools of  adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The range of systems treated is extensive; affine, switched, singularly perturbed and time-delay nonlinear systems are discussed as are the uses of neural networks and techniques of value and policy iteration.^ The text features three main aspects of ADP in which the methods proposed for stabilization and for tracking and games benefit from the incorporation of optimal control methods: • infinite-horizon control for which the difficulty of solving partial differential Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations directly is overcome, and  proof provided that the iterative value function updating sequence converges to the infimum of all the value functions obtained by admissible control law sequences; • finite-horizon control, implemented in discrete-time nonlinear systems showing the reader how to obtain suboptimal control solutions within a fixed number of control steps and with results more easily applied in real systems than those usually gained from infinte-horizon control; • nonlinear games for which  a pair of mixed optimal policies are derived for solving games both when the saddle point does not exist, and, when it does,^ avoiding the existence conditions of the saddle point. Non-zero-sum games are studied in the context of a single network scheme in which policies are obtained guaranteeing system stability and minimizing the individual performance function yielding a Nash equilibrium. In order to make the coverage suitable for the student as well as for the expert reader, Adaptive Dynamic Programming for Control: • establishes the fundamental theory involved clearly with each chapter devoted to a clearly identifiable control paradigm; • demonstrates convergence proofs of the ADP algorithms to deepen undertstanding of the derivation of stability and convergence with the iterative computational methods used; and • shows how ADP methods can be put to use both in simulation and in real applications.^ This text will be of considerable interest to researchers interested in optimal control and its applications in operations research, applied mathematics computational intelligence and engineering. Graduate students working in control and operations research will also find the ideas presented here to be a source of powerful methods for furthering their study.The Communications and Control Engineering series reports major technological advances which have potential for great impact in the fields of communication and control. It reflects research in industrial and academic institutions around the world so that the readership can exploit new possibilities as they become available.

Optimal control of partial differential equations,K.-H Hoffmann,mathematics,First published in 1999,/works/OL19892567W?edition=ia%3Aoptimalcontrolpa1998alba,/authors/OL3292662A/K.-H_Hoffmann,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL43254M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Birkhäuser|Language English|Pages 323,"This volume contains the contributions of participants of the conference ""Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations"" held at the Wasserschloss Klaffenbach near Chemnitz (Saxony, Germany) from April 20 to 25, 1998. The conference was organized by the editors of this volume. Along with the dramatic increase in computer power, the application of PDE-based control theory and the corresponding numerical algorithms to industrial problems has become more and more important in recent years. This development is reflected by the fact that researchers focus their interest on challenging problems such as the study of controlled fluid-structure interactions, flexible structures, noise reduction, smart materials, the optimal design of shapes and material properties and specific industrial processes. All of these applications involve the analytical and numerical treatment of nonlinear partial differential equations with nonhomogeneous boundary or transmission conditions along with some cost criteria to be minimized. The mathematical framework contains modelling and analysis of such systems as well as the numerical analysis and implemention of algorithms in order to solve concrete problems. This volume offers a wide spectrum of aspects of the discipline and is of interest to mathematicians as well as to scientists working in the fields of applications.

It presents its primary topics from the viewpoints of discrete, convex and elementary algebraic geometry.  The first part of the book studies classical problems and techniques that refer to polyhedral structures. The authors include a study on algorithms for computing convex hulls as well as the construction of Voronoi diagrams and Delone triangulations.  The second part of the book develops the primary concepts of (non-linear) computational algebraic geometry. Here, the book looks at Gröbner bases and solving systems of polynomial equations. The theory is illustrated by applications in computer graphics, curve reconstruction and robotics.  Throughout the book, interconnections between computational geometry and other disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, optimization and numerical mathematics) are established. Polyhedral and Algebraic Methods in Computational Geometry is directed towards advanced undergraduates in mathematics and computer science, as well as towards engineering students who are interested in the applications of computational geometry.

Finding its genesis in eighteenth century studies of real analytic functions and mechanics, the implicit and inverse function theorems have now blossomed into powerful tools in the theories of partial differential equations, differential geometry, and geometric analysis.  There are many different forms of the implicit function theorem, including (i) the classical formulation for Ck functions, (ii) formulations in other function spaces, (iii) formulations for non-smooth functions, and (iv) formulations for functions with degenerate Jacobian. Particularly powerful implicit function theorems, such as the Nash–Moser theorem, have been developed for specific applications (e.g., the imbedding of Riemannian manifolds). All of these topics, and many more, are treated in the present uncorrected reprint of this classic monograph.Originally published in 2002, The Implicit Function Theorem is an accessible and thorough treatment of implicit and inverse function theorems and their applications. It will be of interest to mathematicians, graduate/advanced undergraduate students, and to those who apply mathematics. The book unifies disparate ideas that have played an important role in modern mathematics. It serves to document and place in context a substantial body of mathematical ideas.

Is drug coverage a free lunch?,Martin Gaynor,mathematics,First published in 2006,/works/OL9005037W,/authors/OL3133833A/Martin_Gaynor,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English|Pages 41,"""Recently, many US employers have adopted less generous prescription drug benefits.  In addition, the U.S.  began to offer prescription drug insurance to approximately 42 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2006.  We use data on individual health insurance claims and benefit data from 1997-2003 to study the effects of changing consumers' co-payments for prescription drugs on the quantity demanded and expenditure on prescription drugs, inpatient care and outpatient care.  We allow for effects both in the year of the co-payment change and in the year following the change.  Our results show that increases in prescription drug prices reduce both the use of and spending on prescription drugs.  However, consumers substitute the use of outpatient care and inpatient care for prescription drug use, and the expenditure reductions on prescription drugs are largely offset by the increases in other spending""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

In this area the mathematical modelling is the most important part. Then the question is: how is this model solved to correlate in a satisfactory way with reality (i.e. real life data)? An answer to this question is given for several reactors and their related systems for the first time. In these cases, software tools are very important, especially when they have to solve a safety problem related to a reactor. One must show the reliability of these tools in order to certify the reactor to the nuclear regulatory authority. The plant analyser is the tool needed to learn about the behaviour of a ""total"" reactor in order to understand the mechanism of the process. The second main subject is the reactor core. After Cernobyl this is self explanatory. Here we are able to point out that the reader can find several answers to new problems in the nuclear industry. This includes a new approach to nuclear mathematical modelling.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Engineering Applications of MATLAB® 5.3 and SIMULINK® 3,Mohand Mokhtari,mathematics,First published in 2000,/works/OL19847481W?edition=ia%3Aengineeringappli00phdm,/authors/OL3135454A/Mohand_Mokhtari,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11955010M-M.jpg,"Publish Date January 15, 2000|Publisher  Springer|Language English|Pages 538","This book, a translation of an original French text, is written in two parts: the first revises the ideas and theoretical bases necessary for a good understanding of the techniques used in the second, which deals with applications of MATLAB(R) and SIMULINK(R) in process control and digital signal processing. Each application is treated through various techniques including the classical methods of automation and of deterministic and random digital processing using fuzzy logic and neural networks. The preceding mathematical study of the physical processes goes from finding the equations to editing the analogical model. Beyond the utilisation of M files, the use of SIMULINK(R) and S-functions, to which an appendix is dedicated, is emphasized. The encapsulation of diagram-blocks, enabling the creation of personalised libraries, one of SIMULINK(R)'s functionalities, has been treated in the appendix. The following SIMULINK(R) toolbox functions and blocks have been used: ""Control System TOOLBOX"", ""Signal Processing TOOLBOX"", ""Neural Network TOOLBOX"" and ""Fuzzy Logic TOOLBOX"". This book is intended for technicians, engineers, academic and industrial researchers who will find here the necessary mathematical tools offered by MATLAB(R), the TOOLBOXES and SIMULINK(R), for the rapid and efficient solution of problems in modeling and in digital or analogical calculation.

Grid generation is a common feature of many computational tasks which require the discretization and representation of space and surfaces. The papers in this volume discuss how the geometric complexity of the physical object or the non-uniform nature of the solution variable make it impossible to use a uniform grid. Since an efficient grid requires knowledge of the computed solution, many of the papers in this volume treat how to construct grids that are adaptively computed with the solution. This volume will be of interest to computational scientists and mathematicians working in a broad variety of applications including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, materials science, chemistry, and physics. Papers treat residual-based error estimation and adaptivity, repartitioning and load balancing for adaptive meshes, data structures and local refinement methods for conservation laws, adaptivity for hp-finite element methods, the resolution of boundary layers in high Reynolds number flow, adaptive methods for elastostatic contact problems, the full domain partition approach to parallel adaptive refinement, the adaptive solution of phase change problems, and quality indicators for triangular meshes.

Across domains such as work, education and the news, various forms of graphs, charts and maps are used to explain, convince and tell stories. In an era in which more and more data are produced and circulated digitally, and digital tools make visualization production increasingly accessible, it is important to study the conditions under which such visual texts are generated, disseminated and thought to be of societal benefit. This book is a contribution to the multi-disciplined and multi-faceted conversation concerning the forms, uses and roles of data visualization in society. Do data visualizations do 'good' or 'bad'? Do they promote understanding and engagement, or do they do ideological work, privileging certain views of the world over others? The contributions in the book engage with these core questions from a range of disciplinary perspectives.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For example, they have been applied in chemical studies, or in fluid turbulence and for combustion and reactive flows.The articles in this book provide a general and unified framework in which stochastic processes are presented as modeling tools for various issues in engineering, physics and chemistry, with particular focuson fluid mechanics and notably dispersed two-phase flows. The aim is to develop what can referred to as stochastic modeling for a whole range of applications.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Adaptive high-resolution sensor waveform design for tracking,Ioannis Kyriakides,mathematics,First published in 2010,/works/OL16917280W?edition=ia%3Aadaptivehighreso00kyri,/authors/OL7199881A/Ioannis_Kyriakides,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25535351M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Morgan & Claypool|Language English,"Recent innovations in modern radar for designing transmitted waveforms, coupled with new algorithms for adaptively selecting the waveform parameters at each time step, have resulted in improvements in tracking performance. Of particular interest are waveforms that can be mathematically designed to have reduced ambiguity function sidelobes as their use can lead to an increase in the target state estimation accuracy Moreover, adaptively positioning the sidelobes can reveal weak target returns by reducing interference from stronger targets. The manuscript provides an overview of recent advances in the design of multicarrier phasecoded waveforms based on Bjorck constant-amplitude zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences for use in an adaptive waveform selection scheme for multiple target tracking. The adaptive waveform design is formulated using sequential Monte Carlo techniques that need to be matched to the highly resolution measurements. The work will be of interest to both practitioners and researchers in radar as well as to researchers in other applications where high resolution measurements can have significant benefits.

A Road to Randomness in Physical Systems,Eduardo Engel,mathematics,First published in 1992,/works/OL3755326W,/authors/OL660071A/Eduardo_Engel,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1280953M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1992|Publisher  Springer-Verlag,              Springer|Language English|Pages 155","There are many ways of introducing the concept of probability in classical, i. e, deter­ ministic, physics. This work is concerned with one approach, known as ""the method of arbitrary funetionJ. "" It was put forward by Poincare in 1896 and developed by Hopf in the 1930's. The idea is the following. There is always some uncertainty in our knowledge of both the initial conditions and the values of the physical constants that characterize the evolution of a physical system. A probability density may be used to describe this uncertainty. For many physical systems, dependence on the initial density washes away with time. Inthese cases, the system's position eventually converges to the same random variable, no matter what density is used to describe initial uncertainty. Hopf's results for the method of arbitrary functions are derived and extended in a unified fashion in these lecture notes. They include his work on dissipative systems subject to weak frictional forces. Most prominent among the problems he considers is his carnival wheel example, which is the first case where a probability distribution cannot be guessed from symmetry or other plausibility considerations, but has to be derived combining the actual physics with the method of arbitrary functions. Examples due to other authors, such as Poincare's law of small planets, Borel's billiards problem and Keller's coin tossing analysis are also studied using this framework. Finally, many new applications are presented.    source: https://www.springer.com/de/book/9780387977409   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Initial card index of more than 100,000 terms was compiled. In the process of further sorting and correcting the terms, using, in particular, Mathematical Encyclopaedia in 5 volumes (Sovetskaya Encyclopaedia Publishing House, Moscow, 1977-84), more than 75,000 terms, combinations of terms, abbreviations and idioms had been selected and included into the present edition.  Terms of the following fields are presented in the dictionary: mathematics foundations, mathematical logic, algebra, theory of numbers, topology, geometry, graph theory, mathematical analysis, theory of functions, differential and integral equations, variation calculus, optimal control theory, functional analysis, computing mathematics, theory of probability, mathematical statistics, information theory, theoretical cybernetics, computation systems theory, theory of catastrophes, utility theory, theory of decision-making, theory of games, mathematical modeling, combinatory analysis, cryptography, mathematical programming.  Англо-русский математический словарь включает в себя кроме терминологии т.н. классической математики (основания математики, математическая логика, алгебра, теория чисел, топология, геометрия, теория функций) также и разделы прикладной математики (теория графов, математический анализ, теория вероятностей, теория информации, теоретическая кибернетика, теория вычислительных систем, математическое моделирование, теория игр, комбинаторный анализ, математическое программирование, планирование операций и ряд смежных областей).  Математический словарь такого объема и содержания издается впервые.  Последнее издание англо-русского математического словаря было осуществлено Издательством иностранной литературы в 1962 г. (12,000 терминов, в т.ч. 'чисто' математических 9,000 терминов).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Because of the rapidly increasing number of surveillance cameras, it has become a key technology for security and safety, with applications ranging from fight against terrorism and crime, to private and public safety (e.g., in private buildings, transport networks, town centres, schools, and hospitals), and to the efficient management of transport networks and public facilities (e.g., traffic lights and railroad crossings). Video surveillance is an extremely interdisciplinary area, embracing the study of methods and algorithms for computer vision and pattern recognition, but also hardware for sensors and acquisition tools, computer architectures, wired and wireless communication infrastructures, and middleware. From an algorithmical standpoint, the general problem can be broken down into several steps, including motion detection, object classification, tracking, activity understanding, and semantic description, each of which poses its own challenges and hurdles for the system designers. Moreover, the scope of video surveillance is being extended to off-line multimedia analysis systems related to security and safety, thus entailing disciplines such as content-based video retrieval for visual data similarity retrieval and video mining for knowledge extraction; typical applications are in forensic video analysis and human behaviour analysis""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book focuses on analyzing the underlying principles of quantum mechanics and explaining the conceptual and theoretical underpinning of quantum mechanics. In particular, the concepts of quantum indeterminacy, quantum measurement and quantum superposition are analyzed to clarify the concepts that are implicit in the formulation of quantum mechanics.The Schrodinger equation is never solved in the book. Rather, the discussion on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics is treated in a rigorous manner based on the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The new concept of the interplay of empirical and trans-empirical constructs in quantum mechanics is introduced to clarify the foundations of quantum mechanics and to explain the counter-intuitive construction of nature in quantum mechanics.The Theoretical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics is aimed at the advanced undergraduate and assumes introductory knowledge of quantum mechanics. Its objective is to provide a solid foundation for the reader to reach a deeper understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics.

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.   Read more Read less",11 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By considering both space complexity in terms of signal quantization and time complexity with respect to data window sizes, this study provides a new perspective to understand the fundamental relationship between probabilistic errors and resources, which may represent data sizes in computer usage, computational complexity in algorithms, sample sizes in statistical analysis and channel bandwidths in communications.

Written by an international group of addiction journal editors and their colleagues, it discusses how to write research articles and systematic reviews, choose a journal, respond to reviewers’ reports, become a reviewer, and resolve the often difficult authorship, ethical and citation issues that arise in addiction science publishing.  As a “Guide for the Perplexed,” Publishing Addiction Science helps novice as well as experienced researchers to deal with these challenges. It is suitable for university courses and forms the basis of the training workshops offered by the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE).  Co-sponsored by ISAJE and the scientific journal Addiction, the third edition of Publishing Addiction Science gives special attention to the challenges faced by researchers from developing and non-English-speaking countries and features new chapters on guidance for clinician-scientists and the growth of infrastructure and career opportunities in addiction science.

Results on properties of approximate solutions which are independent of the length of the interval, for all sufficiently large intervals are presented in a clear manner. Solutions, new approaches, techniques and methods to a number of difficult problems in the calculus of variations  are illustrated throughout this book. This book also contains significant results and information about the turnpike property of the variational problems. This well-known property is a general phenomenon which holds for large classes of variational problems. The author examines the following in relation to the turnpike property  in individual  (non-generic) turnpike results, sufficient and necessary conditions for the turnpike phenomenon as well as in the non-intersection property for extremals of variational problems. This book appeals to mathematicians  working in optimal control and the calculus as  well as with graduate students.​​​   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For example, scientists are investigating the complexity of computer programs, constructive proofs in mathematics and the randomness of physical processes. But there are different approaches to the explication of these concepts. This volume presents important research on the state of this discussion, especially as it refers to quantum mechanics. This `foundational debate' in computer science, mathematics and physics was already fully developed in 1930 in the Vienna Circle. A special section is devoted to its real founder Hans Hahn, referring to his contribution to the history and philosophy of science. The documentation section presents articles on the early Philipp Frank and on the Vienna Circle in exile. Reviews cover important recent literature on logical empiricism and related topics.

These two ideas are tied together using basic commutative algebra involving Gorenstein algebras. Steenrod operations also originated in algebraic topology, but may best be viewed as a means of encoding the information often hidden behind the Frobenius map in characteristic p<>0.  They provide a noncommutative tool to study commutative algebras over a Galois field. In this Tract the authors skilfully bring together these ideas and apply them to problems in invariant theory. A number of remarkable and unexpected interdisciplinary connections are revealed that will interest researchers in the areas of commutative algebra, invariant theory or algebraic topology.

Supermodularity and Complementarity,Donald M.

Most of these examples are manifestations of complementarity, with a common explicit or implicit theoretical basis in properties of a super-modular function on a lattice. Supermodular functions yield a characterization for complementarity and extend the notion of complementarity to a general setting that is a natural mathematical context for studying complementarity and monotone comparative statics. Concepts and results related to supermodularity and monotone comparative statics constitute a new and important formal step in the long line of economics literature on complementarity.  This monograph links complementarity to powerful concepts and results involving supermodular functions on lattices and focuses on analyses and issues related to monotone comparative statics. Don Topkis, who is known for his seminal contributions to this area, here presents a self-contained and up-to-date view of this field, including many new results, to scholars interested in economic theory and its applications as well as to those in related disciplines. The emphasis is on methodology. The book systematically develops a comprehensive, integrated theory pertaining to supermodularity, complementarity, and monotone comparative statics. It then applies that theory in the analysis of many diverse economic models formulated as decision problems, noncooperative games, and cooperative games.  Donald M. Topkis is a Professor at the University of California at Davis.    source: https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6318.html   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications,J.

The Wharton School course on which the book is based is designed for energetic students who have had some experience with probability and statistics, but who have not had advanced courses in stochastic processes. Even though the course assumes only a modest background, it moves quickly and - in the end - students can expect to have the tools that are deep enough and rich enough to be relied upon throughout their professional careers. The course begins with simple random walk and the analysis of gambling games. This material is used to motivate the theory of martingales, and, after reaching a decent level of confidence with discrete processes, the course takes up the more demanding development of continuous time stochastic process, especially Brownian motion. The construction of Brownian motion is given in detail, and enough material on the subtle properties of Brownian paths is developed so that the student should sense of when intuition can be trusted and when it cannot. The course then takes up the Itô integral and aims to provide a development that is honest and complete without being pedantic. With the Itô integral in hand, the course focuses more on models. Stochastic processes of importance in Finance and Economics are developed in concert with the tools of stochastic calculus that are needed in order to solve problems of practical importance. The financial notion of replication is developed, and the Black-Scholes PDE is derived by three different methods. The course then introduces enough of the theory of the diffusion equation to be able to solve the Black-Scholes PDE and prove the uniqueness of the solution.

New mathematical methods are developed enabling the gravitational potential of a planetary body to be modeled and analyzed using a continuous flow of observations from land or satellite devices. Harmonic wavelet methods are introduced, as well as fast computational schemes and various numerical test examples. The work is divided into two main parts: Part I treats well-posed boundary-value problems of potential theory and elasticity; Part II examines ill-posed problems such as satellite-to-satellite tracking, satellite gravity gradiometry, and gravimetry. Both sections demonstrate how multiresolution representations yield Runge-Walsh type solutions that are both accurate in approximation and tractable in computation. Topic and key features: * Comprehensive coverage of topics which, thus far, are only scattered in journal articles and conference proceedings * Important applications and developments for future satellite scenarios; new modelling techniques involving low-orbiting satellites * Multiscale approaches for numerous geoscientific problems, including geoidal determination, magnetic field reconstruction, deformation analysis, and density variation modelling * Multilevel stabilization procedures for regularization * Treatment of the real Earth's shape as well as a spherical Earth model * Modern methods of constructive approximation * Exercises at the end of each chapter and an appendix with hints to their solutions Models and methods presented show how various large- and small-scale processes may be addressed by a single geoscientific modelling framework for potential determination. Multiscale Potential Theory may be used as a textbook for graduate-level courses in geomathematics, applied mathematics, and geophysics. The book is also an up-to-date reference text for geoscientists, applied mathematicians, and engineers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Cars and sand grains have in common, that they interact irreversibly, which is the reason for similar jamming phenomena. The main difference is that car drivers choose their destination and route individually, while grains follow external driving forces. This book gives an overview about the progress in modelling, computer simulation, experiments and field observations, which was reached within the last two years. The contributions are based on the International Workshop Traffic and Granular Flow '01, which took place in Nagoya, 15 - 17 October 2001. Topics include a critical classification of models for highway traffic, new technological applications, friction and arching phenomena in pedestrian traffic, scale free networks and internet traffic, instabilities and fluctuations in avalanches and granular pipe flow.

In its remaining fourteen chapters, the book explores the consequences of the perspective offered by IST as a wide range of real analysis topics are surveyed.

The book avoids any preconceptions about the real numbers and takes them to be nothing but the elements of a complete ordered field. All of the standard topics are included, as well as a proper treatment of the trigonometric functions, which many authors take for granted. The final chapters of the book provide a gentle, example-based introduction to metric spaces with an application to differential equations on the real line. The author's exposition is concise and to the point, helping students focus on the essentials. Over 200 exercises of varying difficulty are included, many of them adding to the theory in the text.

It presents the latest developments in this field from applications, architecture, and tools and methodologies points of view. We hope that this work will form a reference for existing researchers in the field, and entice new researchers and developers to join the HPRC community.  The book includes:  Thirteen application chapters which present the most important application areas tackled by high performance reconfigurable computers, namely: financial computing, bioinformatics and computational biology, data search and processing, stencil computation e.g. computational fluid dynamics and seismic modeling, cryptanalysis, astronomical N-body simulation, and circuit simulation.     Seven architecture chapters which present both commercial and academic parallel FPGA architectures, low latency and high performance FPGA-based networks and memory architectures for parallel machines, and a high speed optical dynamic reconfiguration mechanism for HPRC.  Five tools and methodologies chapters which address the important issue of productivity and high performance in HPRC. These include a study of precision and arithmetic issues in HPRC, comparative studies of C-based high level synthesis tools and RTL-based approaches, taxonomy of HPRC tools and a framework of their analysis, and an integrated hardware-software-application approach to HPRC.

But after twenty straight losing seasons and his job on the line, he was ready to try anything. So when he met with GM Neal Huntington in October 2012, they decided to discard everything they knew about the game and instead take on drastic ""big data"" strategies. Going well beyond the number-crunching of Moneyball, which used statistics found on the back of baseball cards to identify market inefficiencies, the data the Pirates employed was not easily observable. They collected millions of data points on pitches and balls in play, creating a tome of reports that revealed key insights for how to win more games without spending a dime. They discovered that most batters struggled to hit two-seam fastballs, that an aggressive defensive shift on the field could turn more batted balls into outs, and that a catcher's most valuable skill was hidden. Hurdle and Huntington got to work trying to convince the entire Pirates organization and disgruntled fans to embrace these unconventional, yet groundbreaking methods. All this led to the end to the longest consecutive run of losing seasons in North American pro sports history.The Pirates' 2013 season is the perfect lens for examining baseball's burgeoning big-data movement. Using flawless reporting, award-winning journalist Travis Sawchik takes you behind-the-scenes to reveal a game-changing book of miracles and math""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|3 Have read

Response surface methodology (RSM), well-known in literature, is widely used in every field of science and technology such as Biology, Natural (Physical/Chemical), Environmental, Medical, Agricultural, Quality engineering etc. RSM is the most popular experimental data generating, modeling and optimization technique in every field of science. It is a particular case of robust response surface methodology (RRSM). RSM has many limitations, and RRSM aims to overcome many of such limitations. Thus, RRSM will be much better than RSM. It is intended for anyone who knows basic concepts of experimental designs and regression analysis. This is the first unique book on RRSM. Every chapter is unique regarding its contents, presentation and organization. Problems on robust response surface designs such as rotatability, slope-rotatability, weak rotatability, optimality, and along with the method of estimation of model parameters, positive data analysis techniques are considered in this book. Some real examples on lifetime responses, resistivity, replicated measures, medical, demography, hydrogeology data etc., are analysed. Some examples (considered in this book) on design of experiments do not satisfy the classical assumptions of response surface methodology.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Statistical models and causal inference,David Freedman,mathematics,First published in 2009,/works/OL16928555W?edition=ia%3Astatisticalmodel00afre,/authors/OL2685783A/David_Freedman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24094770M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 399,"""David A. Freedman presents here a definitive synthesis of his approach to causal inference in the social sciences. He explores the foundations and limitations of statistical modeling, illustrating basic arguments with examples from political science, public policy, law, and epidemiology. Freedman maintains that many new technical approaches to statistical modeling constitute not progress, but regress. Instead, he advocates a 'shoe leather' methodology, which exploits natural variation to mitigate confounding and relies on intimate knowledge of the subject matter to develop meticulous research designs and eliminate rival explanations. When Freedman first enunciated this position, he was met with scepticism, in part because it was hard to believe that a mathematical statistician of his stature would favor 'low-tech' approaches. But the tide is turning. Many social scientists now agree that statistical technique cannot substitute for good research design and subject matter knowledge. This book offers an integrated presentation of Freedman's views""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Currency choice and exchange rate pass-through,Gita Gopinath,mathematics,First published in 2007,/works/OL12233088W,/authors/OL5332139A/Gita_Gopinath,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English|Pages 44,"A central assumption of open economy macro models with nominal rigidities relates to the currency in which goods are priced, whether there is so-called producer currency pricing or local currency pricing. This has important implications for exchange rate pass-through and optimal exchange rate policy. We show, using novel transaction level information on currency and prices for U.S. imports, that even conditional on a price change, there is a large difference in the pass-through of the average good priced in dollars (25%) versus non-dollars (95%). This finding is contrary to the assumption in a large class of models that the currency of pricing is exogenous and is evidence of an important selection effect that results from endogenous currency choice. We describe a model of optimal currency choice in an environment of staggered price setting and show that the empirical evidence strongly supports the model's predictions of the relation between currency choice and pass-through. We further document evidence of significant real rigidities, with the pass-through of dollar pricers increasing above 50% in the long-run. Lastly, we numerically illustrate the currency choice decision in both a Calvo and a menu-cost model with variable mark-ups and imported intermediate inputs and evaluate the ability of these models to match pass-through patterns documented in the data.

Using 1999-2001 data from Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we compared the labor market and welfare experience of women with four employment barriers: poor mental health, moderate to heavy drug and alcohol use, a child with a behavior problem, and a child under the age of 3.  Women with poor mental health and drug and alcohol users were much less likely to move into work than other groups, and more likely to be sanctioned for noncompliance with welfare requirements in 2000-2001 as federal work participation requirements increased""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

This insightful overview looks at techniques that were introduced in the fields of mathematics, logic and philosophy during the twentieth century, and explores their effect on the work of various linguists. In particular, it discusses the 'foundations crisis' that destabilised mathematics at the start of the twentieth century, the numerous related movements which sought to respond to this crisis, and how they influenced the development of syntactic theory in the 1950s.  The book concludes by discussing the resulting major consequences for current syntactic theory, and provides a groundbreaking and detailed reassessment of Chomsky's early work at the advent of Generative Grammar. Informative and revealing, this book will be invaluable to all those working in formal linguistics, in particular those interested in its history and development.

Bang-bang control development of permeability changes in a membrane model,Robert Melendy,mathematics,First published in 1997,/works/OL11599043W,/authors/OL4894669A/Robert_Melendy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1997|Language English|Pages 39,The application of systems and control theory to membrane physiology is presented here. Modeling efforts have focused on describing those physiologically realistic mechanisms which govern the regulation of membrane permeability in nerve. The motivation behind identifying such mechanisms lies in understanding the morphology of neural activity on a meaningful and analytically tractable level. The suggested merit of integrating control theory into the analysis lies in providing how a membrane effectively adapts to changes in permeability and through what governing mechanisms. The value in producing such an understanding lies in mirroring biological reality in a more formal manner than could be achieved solely through experimental means. A bang-bang control policy describing the permeability correction mechanisms is developed using Liapunov's Stability Criteria. Both changes in membrane potential and kinetic rates are required to implement the policy. The policy describes the inherent mechanisms of the membrane which act to drive its permeability from unstable firing to the resting potential state. It is shown that these permeability changes in state are governed by a switching function that depends on the membrane potential and a dominant controlling parameter. The control policy is discussed in the context of solutions of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations of Ionic Hypothesis.   Read more Read less,0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dominant run-length method for image classification,Xiaoou Tang,mathematics,First published in 1997,/works/OL11591501W,/authors/OL4891306A/Xiaoou_Tang,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Language English|Pages 27,"In this paper, we develop a new run-length texture feature extraction algorithm that significantly improves image classification accuracy over traditional techniques. By directly using part or all of the run-length matrix as a feature vector, much of the texture information is preserved. This approach is made possible by the introduction of a new multi-level dominant eigenvector estimation algorithm. It reduces the computational complexity of the Karhunen-Loeve Transform by several orders of magnitude. Combined with the Bhattacharya distance measure, they form an efficient feature selection algorithm. The advantage of this approach is demonstrated experimentally by the classification of two independent texture data sets. Perfect classification is achieved on the first data set of eight Brodatz textures. The 97% classification accuracy on the second data set of sixteen Vistex images further confirms the effectiveness of the algorithm. Based on the observation that most texture information is contained in the first few columns of the run-length matrix, especially in the first column, we develop a new fast, parallel run-length matrix computation scheme. Comparisons with the co-occurrence and wavelet methods demonstrate that the run-length matrices contain great discriminatory information and that a method of extracting such information is of paramount importance to successful classification.

The labor market and macro volatility,Robert Ernest Hall,mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL2669713W,/authors/OL389453A/Robert_Ernest_Hall,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""The evolution of the aggregate labor market is far from smooth.  I investigate the success of a macro model in replicating the observed levels of volatility of unemployment and other key variables.  I take variations in productivity growth and in exogenous product demand (government purchases plus net exports) as the primary exogenous sources of fluctuations.  The macro model embodies new ideas about the labor market, all based on equilibrium--the models I consider do not rest on inefficiency in the use of labor caused by an inappropriate wage.  I find that non-standard features of the labor market are essential for understanding the volatility of unemployment.  These models include simple equilibrium wage stickiness, where the sticky wage is an equilibrium selection rule.  A second model based on modern bargaining theory delivers a different kind of stickiness and has a unique equilibrium.  A third model posits fluctuations in matching efficiency that may arise from variations over time in the information about prospective jobs among job-seekers.  Reasonable calibrations of each of the three models match the observed volatility of unemployment""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Using estate tax returns data, we observe that the share of women among the very wealthy (top 0.01%) in the United States peaked in the late 1960s, reaching almost 50%. Three decades on, women's share had declined to one third, a return to pre-war levels. We argue that this pattern mirrors the relative importance of inherited vs. self-made wealth in the economy and thus the gender-composition of the wealthiest may serve as a proxy for inter-generational wealth mobility. This proxy for ""dynastic wealth'' suggests that wealth mobility in the past century decreased until the 1970s and rose thereafter, a pattern consistent with technological change driving long term trends in income inequality and mobility. Greater wealth mobility in recent decades is also consistent with the simultaneous rise in top income shares and relatively stable wealth concentration.""--abstract.

Technological progress is the engine of such transformation.  Three mechanisms arestressed:(i) The rise in real wages and its corresponding wealth effect;(ii) The enhanced value of time off from work, due to the advent of time-using leisure goods;(iii) The reduced need for housework, due to the introduction of time-saving appliances.These mechanisms are incorporated into a model of household production.  The notion of Edgeworth-Pareto complementarity/substitutability is key to the analysis.

(1994, 1995), but using a linear-quadratic (LQ) approximation to derive a log-linear approximation to the optimal policy rules.  The example illustrates how inaccurate ""naive"" LQ approximation --- in which the quadratic objective is obtained from a simple Taylor expansion of the utility function of the representative household---can be, but also shows how a correct LQ approximation can be obtained, which will provide a correct local approximation to the optimal policy rules in the case of small enough shocks.  We also consider the numerical accuracy of the LQ approximation in the case of shocks of the size assumed in the calibration of Chari et al.  We find that the correct LQ approximation yields results that are quite accurate, and similar in most respects to the results obtained by Chari et al.  using a more computationally intensive numerical method""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Yet recently developed models of herd behavior have been subjected to two critiques which seem to make them inapplicable to financial crises.  Herds disappear from these models if two of their unappealing assumptions are modified: if their zero-one investment decisions are made continuous and if their investors are allowed to trade assets with market-determined prices.  However, both critiques are overturned--herds reappear in these models--once another of their unappealing assumptions is modified: if, instead of moving in a prespecified order, investors can move whenever they choose""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site.

Semiparametric causality tests using the policy propensity score,Joshua David Angrist,mathematics,First published in 2004,/works/OL5889285W,/authors/OL1452606A/Joshua_David_Angrist,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Time series data are widely used to explore causal relationships, typically in a regression framework with lagged dependent variables.  Regression-based causality tests rely on an array of functional form and distributional assumptions for valid causal inference.  This paper develops a semi-parametric test for causality in models linking a binary treatment or policy variable with unobserved potential outcomes.  The procedure is semiparametric in the sense that we model the process determining treatment -- the policy propensity score -- but leave the model for outcomes unspecified.  This general approach is motivated by the notion that we typically have better prior information about the policy determination process than about the macro-economy.  A conceptual innovation is that we adapt the cross-sectional potential outcomes framework to a time series setting.  This leads to a generalized definition of Sims (1980) causality.  We also develop a test for full conditional independence, in contrast with the usual focus on mean independence.  Our approach is illustrated using data from the Romer and Romer (1989) study of the relationship between the Federal reserve's monetary policy and output""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Redistribution by insurance market regulation,Amy Finkelstein,mathematics,First published in 2006,/works/OL5891590W,/authors/OL1453063A/Amy_Finkelstein,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper shows how models of insurance markets with asymmetric information can be calibrated and solved to yield quantitative estimates of the consequences of government regulation.  We estimate the impact of restricting gender-based pricing in the United Kingdom retirement annuity market, a market in which individuals are required to annuitize tax-preferred retirement savings but are allowed considerable choice over the annuity contract they purchase.  After calibrating a lifecycle utility model and estimating a model of annuitant mortality that allows for unobserved heterogeneity, we solve for the range of equilibrium contract structures with and without gender-based pricing.  Eliminating gender-based pricing is generally thought to redistribute resources from men to women, since women have longer life expectancies.  We find that allowing insurers to offer a menu of contracts may reduce the amount of redistribution from men to women associated with gender-blind pricing requirements to half the level that would occur if insurers were required to sell a single pre-specified policy.  The latter ""one policy"" scenario corresponds loosely to settings in which governments provide compulsory annuities as part of their Social Security program.  Our findings suggest that recognizing the endogenous structure of insurance contracts is important for analyzing the economic effects of insurance market regulations.  More generally, our results suggest that theoretical models of insurance market equilibrium can be used for quantitative policy analysis, not simply to derive qualitative findings""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Revisiting the supply-side effects of government spending under incomplete markets,Marios Angeletos,mathematics,First published in 2007,/works/OL5888822W,/authors/OL1452543A/Marios_Angeletos,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper revisits the macroeconomic effects of government consumption in the neoclassical growth model augmented with idiosyncratic investment (or entrepreneurial) risk.  Under complete markets, a permanent increase in government consumption has no long-run effect on the interest rate, the capital-labor ratio, and labor productivity, while it increases work hours due to the familiar negative wealth effect.  These results are upset once we allow for incomplete markets.  The very same negative wealth effect now causes a reduction in risk taking and investment.  This in turn leads to a lower risk-free rate and, under certain conditions, also to a lower capital-labor ratio, lower productivity and lower wages""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We model the interaction of these truisms, and show the implications for global specialization and trade: products where timely delivery is important will be produced near the source of final demand, where wages will be higher as a result.  In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows retailers to respond to fluctuating final demand without holding costly inventories, and timely delivery is only possible from nearby locations.  Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of US apparel imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products where timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries""--Federal Reserve Board web site.

Earnings inequality follows a U-shape pattern, decreasing sharply up to 1953 and increasing steadily afterwards. We find that short-term and long-term (rank based) mobility among all workers has been quite stable since 1950 (after a temporary surge during World War II). Therefore, the pattern of annual earnings inequality is very close to the pattern of inequality of longer term earnings. Mobility at the top has also been very stable and has not mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since the 1970s. However, the stability in long-term earnings mobility among all workers masks substantial heterogeneity across demographic groups. The decrease in the gender earnings gap and the substantial increase in upward mobility over a career for women is the driving force behind the relative stability of overall mobility measures which mask declines in mobility among men. In contrast, overall inequality and mobility patterns are not significantly influenced by the changing size and structure of immigration nor by changes in the black/white earnings gaps.

Testing the theory of trade policy,James Harrigan,mathematics,First published in 2006,/works/OL5812620W,/authors/OL1423995A/James_Harrigan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Quota restrictions on United States imports of apparel and textiles under the multifibre arrangement (MFA) ended abruptly in January 2005.  This change in policy was large, predetermined, and fully anticipated, making it an ideal natural experiment for testing the theory of trade policy.  We focus on simple and robust theory predictions about the effects of binding quotas, and also compute nonparametric estimates of the cost of the MFA.  We find that prices of quota constrained categories from China fell by 38% in 2005, while prices in unconstrained categories from China and from other countries changed little.  We also find substantial quality downgrading in imports from China in previously constrained categories, as predicted by theory.  The annual cost of the MFA to U.S.  consumers was about $100 per household""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Readers gain a solid theoretical foundation for all the methods discussed in the text and learn to write FORTRAN90 and MATLAB(r) programs to solve problems. This new edition is enhanced with new material and pedagogical tools, reflecting the author's hands-on teaching experience, including:   A new chapter covering modern supercomputing and parallel programming   Fifty percent more examples and exercises that help clarify theory and demonstrate real-world applications   MATLAB(r) versions of all the FORTRAN90 programs   An appendix with answers to selected problems    The book starts with basic definitions and results from linear algebra that are used as a foundation for later chapters. The following four chapters present and analyze direct and iterative methods for the solution of linear systems of equations, linear least-squares problems, linear eigenvalue problems, and linear programming problems. Next, a chapter is devoted to the fast Fourier transform, a topic not often covered by comparable texts. The final chapter features a practical introduction to writing computational linear algebra software to run on today's vector and parallel supercomputers.    Highlighted are double-precision FORTRAN90 subroutines that solve the problems presented in the text. The subroutines are carefully documented and readable, allowing students to follow the program logic from start to finish. MATLAB(r) versions of the codes are listed in an appendix. Machine-readable copies of the FORTRAN90 and MATLAB(r) codes can be downloaded from the text's accompanying Web site.    With its clear style and emphasis on problem solving, this is a superior textbook for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students.

The concept of infinity has fascinated and confused mankind for centuries with concepts and ideas that cause even seasoned mathematicians to wonder. For instance, the idea that a set is infinite if it is not a finite set is an elementary concept that jolts our common sense and imagination. the Mathematics of Infinity: A guide to Great Ideas uniquely explores how we can manipulate these ideas when our common sense rebels at the conclusions we are drawing.    Writing with clear knowledge and affection for the subject, the author introduces and explores infinite sets, infinite cardinals, and ordinals, thus challenging the readers' intuitive beliefs about infinity. Requiring little mathematical training and a healthy curiosity, the book presents a user-friendly approach to ideas involving the infinite. readers will discover the main ideas of infinite cardinals and ordinal numbers without experiencing in-depth mathematical rigor. Classic arguments and illustrative examples are provided throughout the book and are accompanied by a gradual progression of sophisticated notions designed to stun your intuitive view of the world.    With a thoughtful and balanced treatment of both concepts and theory, The Mathematics of Infinity focuses on the following topics:   Sets and Functions   Images and Preimages of Functions   Hilbert's Infinite Hotel   Cardinals and Ordinals   The Arithmetic of Cardinals and Ordinals   the Continuum Hypothesis   Elementary Number Theory   The Riemann Hypothesis   The Logic of Paradoxes    Recommended as recreational reading for the mathematically inquisitive or as supplemental reading for curious college students, the Mathematics of Infinity: A Guide to Great Ideas gently leads readers into the world of counterintuitive mathematics.

Models for anchoring and acquiescence bias in consumption data,Arthur van Soest,mathematics,First published in 2004,/works/OL4228144W,/authors/OL809803A/Arthur_van_Soest,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Item non-response in household survey data on economic variables such as income, assets or consumption is a well-known problem.  Follow-up unfolding bracket questions have been used as a tool to collect partial information on respondents that do not answer an open-ended question.  It is also known, however, that mistakes are made in answering such unfolding bracket questions.  In this paper, we develop several limited dependent variable models to analyze two sources of mistakes, anchoring and acquiescence (or yeasaying), focusing on the first bracket question.  We use the experimental module of the AHEAD 1995 data, where the sample is randomly split into respondents who get an open-ended question on the amount of total family consumption - with follow-up unfolding brackets (of the form: is consumption $X or more?) for those who answer immediately directed to unfolding brackets.  In both cases, the entry point of the unfolding bracket sequence is randomized.  We compare models in which the probability of a mistake depends on the deviation between the true consumption amount and the entry point amount $X and models in which it does not.  We find that allowing for acquiescence bias substantially changes the conclusions on the selective nature of non-response to the open-ended question and on the distribution of consumption expenditures in the population.  Once acquiescence bias is taken into account, anchoring in the first bracket question plays only a minor role""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Whereas our methodology is general, we focus on an extended macro-model with an unobservable time-varying inflation target and the natural rate of output which are filtered from macro and term structure data.  We obtain large and significant estimates of the Phillips curve and real interest rate response parameters.  Our model also delivers strong contemporaneous responses of the entire term structure to various macroeconomic shocks.  The inflation target dominates the variation in the ""level factor"" whereas the monetary policy shocks dominate the variation in the ""slope and curvature factors""""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

If consumers are Bayesian, firms will not shroud information in equilibrium.  However, shrouding may occur in an economy with some myopic (or unaware) consumers.  Such shrouding creates an inefficiency, which firms may have an incentive to eliminate by educating their competitors' customers.  However, if add-ons have close substitutes, a ""curse of debiasing"" arises, and firms will not be able to profitably debias consumers by unshrouding add-ons.  In equilibrium, two kinds of exploitation coexist.  Optimizing firms exploit myopic consumers through marketing schemes that shroud high-priced add-ons.  In turn, sophisticated consumers exploit these marketing schemes.  It is not possible to profitably drive away the business of sophisticates.  It is also not possible to profitably lure either myopes or sophisticates to non-exploitative firms.  We show that informational shrouding flourishes even in highly competitive markets, even in markets with costless advertising, and even when the shrouding generates allocational inefficiencies""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

S. Green, a former student of Max Born and well known as an author in physics and in philosophy of science, presents an individual and modern approach to theoretical physics and related fundamental problems. Starting from first principles, the links between physics and information science are unveiled step by step: modern information theory and the classical theory of the Turing machine are combined to create a new interpretation of quantum computability, which is then applied to field theory, gravitation and submicroscopic measurement theory and culminates in a detailed examination of the role of the conscious observer in physical measurements. The result is a highly readable book that unifies a wide range of scientific knowledge and is essential reading for all scientists and philosophers of science interested in the interpretation and the implications of the interaction between information science and basic physical theories.

Many techniques are inspired by the great works of Issai Schur who passed away some 60 years ago. This volume is dedicated to his memory. This is a unified presentation consisting of an extended biography of Schur--written in collaboration with some of his former students--as well as survey articles on Schur's legacy (Schur theory, functions, etc). Additionally, there are articles covering the areas of orbits, crystals and representation theory, with special emphasis on canonical bases and their crystal limits, and on the geometric approach linking orbits to representations and Hecke algebra techniques. Extensions of representation theory to mathematical physics and geometry will also be presented. Contributors: Biography: W. Ledermann, B. Neumann, P.M. Neumann, H. Abelin- Schur; Review of work: H. Dym, V. Katznelson; Original papers: H.H. Andersen, A. Braverman, S. Donkin, V. Ivanov, D. Kazhdan, B. Kostant, A. Lascoux, N. Lauritzen, B. Leclerc, P. Littelmann, G. Luzstig, O. Mathieu, M.

These methodologies can be categorized in a variety of ways, such as form of model (e.g. linear, non-linear, stochastic), characteristics of the decision space (e.g. finite or infinite), or solution process (e.g. prior specification of preferences or interactive). Scientists from a variety of disciplines (mathematics, economics and psychology) have contributed to the development of the field of Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) (or Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multiattribute Decision Making (MADM), Multiobjective Decision Making (MODM), etc.) over the past 30 years, helping to establish MCDM as an important part of management science. MCDM has become a central component of studies in management science, economics and industrial engineering in many universities worldwide. Multicriteria Decision Making: Advances in MCDM Models, Algorithms, Theory and Applications aims to bring together `state-of-the-art' reviews and the most recent advances by leading experts on the fundamental theories, methodologies and applications of MCDM. This is aimed at graduate students and researchers in mathematics, economics, management and engineering, as well as at practicing management scientists who wish to better understand the principles of this new and fast developing field.

The authors present a concise introduction to this theory, presenting at the same time methods of solving a large class of difference equations. They apply the theory to various problems in scientific computing, probability, queuing theory, coding and information compression. The book is an expanded and revised version of the first edition, published in Russian (Nauka 1985). Students and scientists will find a useful textbook in numerical analysis.

They reflect the immense influence that his work has had on modern statistics. The papers include discussions of Le Cam's seminal ideas, historical perspectives, and contributions to current research. They reach back two centuries, with a new translation of a paper of Daniel Bernoulli, and they reach forward to new ideas about semiparametric theory and wavelets. The volume begins with the paper of Aalen, which describes Le Cam's role in the founding of the martingale analysis of point processes, and ends with the paper of Yu, which explores the position of just one of Le Cam's ideas in modern semiparametric theory. The other 27 papers touch on other areas-such as local asymptotic normality, contiguity, efficiency, admissibility, minimaxity, empirical process theory, and biological medical, and meterological applications - where Le Cam's insights have been the foundations on which a theory has been built.

In particular, he developed a theory of epistemic cycles to explain how it is that we come to know things. Publication of his views on quantum mechanics was frequently blocked by the establishment, still anaesthetized by the Copenhagen interpretation, and so his work has remained relatively unknown. This book describes his ideas on the philosophy of physics, particularly the philosophical problems of quantum mechanics including the ensemble concept of probability, causality, realism, quantum logic and Bell's inequalities. This challenging work will appeal to all opend-minded students of science and its philosophy.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The concepts and most of the statements are formulated in precise and exact mathematical language. Nevertheless, the emphasis is on the physical concepts. The authors discuss thoroughly the aspects of stochastic mechanics in quantum mechanics, firstly as a way of quantization as proposed by E. Nelson and secondly, as a tool to give a more detailed description of microphysics within the framework of the standard form of quantum theory. Another part of their work treats stochastic mechanics as a general description of a class of dynamical systems disturbed by some isotropic translation invariant noise thus extending Nelson's theory within the framework of classical physics. The necessary tools like stochastic processes, in particular those used in mathematical physics, existence and construction of diffusion processes as well as stochastic variational principles are presented in detail. Here is certainly an excellent text on this important field of mathematical physics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Introduction to Discrete Mathematics with ISETL,William E.

Working with the programming language ISETL, whose syntax is close to that of standard mathematical language, the student constructs the concepts in her or his mind as a result of constructing them on the computer in the syntax of ISETL. This dramatically different approach allows students to attempt to discover concepts in a ""Socratic"" dialog with the computer. The discussion avoids the formal ""definition-theorem"" approach and promotes active involvement by the reader by its questioning style. An instructor using this text can expect a lively class whose students develop a deep conceptual understanding rather than simply manipulative skills. Topics covered in this book include: the propositional calculus, operations on sets, basic counting methods, predicate calculus, relations, graphs, functions, and mathematical induction.

In this first-ever graduate textbook on the algorithmic aspects of real algebraic geometry, the main ideas and techniques presented form a coherent and rich body of knowledge, linked to many areas of mathematics and computing. Mathematicians already aware of real algebraic geometry will find relevant information about the algorithmic aspects, and researchers in computer science and engineering will find the required mathematical background. Being self-contained the book is accessible to graduate students and even, for invaluable parts of it, to undergraduate students.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Infinite Horizon Optimal Control,Dean A.

The first five to six chapters provide a good introduction to infinite horizon control theory and require only a minimal knowledge of mathematical control theory. The remainder of the book considers extensions of the previous chapters to a variety of control systems, including Distributed Parameter Systems, Stochastic Control Systems and Hereditary Systems. Consequently these chapters require more sophistication. Throughout the book it is possible to distinguish three categories of research: - The extension of the classical necessary conditions to various weaker types of optimality (e.g., overtaking optimality); - The discussion of various sufficient conditions and verification theorems for the various types of optimality; - The discussion of existence theorems for the various types of optimality. The common link between these categories is the ""Turnpike Property"" and the notion of ""Reduction to Finite Costs"". Once these properties are established for a given control system, it is possible to begin investigating the issues described in the above three categories.

The first concerns the general theory at the beginner's level. Presenting classical theorems, the book describes the topologies and uniform structures of Boolean algebras, the basics of complete Boolean algebras and their continuous homomorphisms, as well as lifting theory. The first part also includes an introductory chapter describing the elementary to the theory. The second part deals at a graduate level with the metric theory of Boolean algebras at a graduate level. The covered topics include measure algebras, their sub algebras, and groups of automorphisms. Ample room is allotted to the new classification theorems abstracting the celebrated counterparts by D.Maharam, A.H. Kolmogorov, and V.A.Rokhlin. Boolean Algebras in Analysis is an exceptional definitive source on Boolean algebra as applied to functional analysis and probability. It is intended for all who are interested in new and powerful tools for hard and soft mathematical analysis.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It employs straightforward language and examples to show the power of wavelet transforms without overwhelming mathematics, reviews other methods, and compares wavelets with other techniques that provide similar capabilities. It uses examples illustrated in MATLAB codes to assist chemists in developing applications, and includes access to a supplementary Web site providing code and data sets for work examples. Wavelet Transformations and Their Applications in Chemistry will prove essential to professionals and students working in analytical chemistry and process chemistry, as well as physical chemistry, spectroscopy, and statistics.

The geometry of Walker manifolds,Miguel Brozos-Vázquez,mathematics,First published in 2009,/works/OL16934177W?edition=ia%3Ageometrywalkerma00garc,/authors/OL7202906A/Miguel_Brozos-Vázquez,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25542503M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Morgan & Claypool Publishers|Language English,"This book, which focuses on the study of curvature, is an introduction to various aspects of pseudo- Riemannian geometry. We shall use Walker manifolds (pseudo-Riemannian manifolds which admit a non-trivial parallel null plane field) to exemplify some of the main differences between the geometry of Riemannian manifolds and the geometry of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and thereby illustrate phenomena in pseudo-Riemannian geometry that are quite different from those which occur in Riemannian geometry, i.e. for indefinite as opposed to positive definite metrics. Indefinite metrics are important in many diverse physical contexts: classical cosmological models (general relativity) and string theory to name but two. Walker manifolds appear naturally in numerous physical settings and provide examples of extremal mathematical situations as will be discussed presently. To describe the geometry of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one must first understand the curvature of the manifold. We shall analyze a wide variety of curvature properties and we shall derive both geometrical and topological results. Special attention will be paid to manifolds of dimension 3 as these are quite tractable. We then pass to the 4 dimensional setting as a gateway to higher dimensions. Since the book is aimed at a very general audience (and in particular to an advanced undergraduate or to a beginning graduate student), no more than a basic course in differential geometry is required in the way of background. To keep our treatment as self-contained as possible,we shall begin with two elementary chapters that provide an introduction to basic aspects of pseudo-Riemannian geometry before beginning on our study of Walker geometry. An extensive bibliography is provided for further reading.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Functional Analysis,Kôsaku Yosida,mathematics,First published in 1965,/works/OL31656902W,/authors/OL7923730A/Kôsaku_Yosida,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 1965|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg,              Springer|Language English","The present book is based on lectures given by the author at the University of Tokyo during the past ten years. It is intended as a textbook to be studied by students on their own or to be used in a course on Functional Analysis, i. e. , the general theory of linear operators in function spaces together with salient features of its application to diverse fields of modern and classical analysis. Necessary prerequisites for the reading of this book are summarized, with or without proof, in Chapter 0 under titles: Set Theory, Topo­ logical Spaces, Measure Spaces and Linear Spaces. Then, starting with the chapter on Semi-norms, a general theory of Banach and Hilbert spaces is presented in connection with the theory of generalized functions of S. L. SoBOLEV and L. ScmVARTZ. While the book is primarily addressed to graduate students, it is hoped it might prove useful to research mathe­ maticians, both pure and applied. The reader may pass e. g. from Chapter IX (Analytical Theory of Semi-groups) directly to Chapter XIII (Ergodic Theory and Diffusion Theory) and to Chapter XIV (Integ-ration of the Equation of Evolution). Such materials as ""Weak Topologies and Duality in Locally Convex Spaces"" and ""Nuclear Spaces"" are presented in the form of the appendices to Chapter V and Chapter X, respectively. These might be skipped for the first reading by those who are interested rather in the application of linear operators.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It also presents optimization techniques such as fuzzy linear and non-linear programming, applications to graph problems and fuzzy combinatorial methods such as fuzzy dynamic programming. In addition, the book also accounts for advances in fuzzy data analysis, fuzzy statistics, and applications to reliability analysis. These topics are covered within four parts: Decision Making, Mathematical Programming, Statistics and Data Analysis, and Reliability, Maintenance and Replacement. The scope and content of the book has resulted from multiple interactions between the editor of the volume, the series editors, the series advisory board, and experts in each chapter area. Each chapter was written by a well-known researcher on the topic and reviewed by other experts in the area. These expert reviewers sometimes became co-authors because of the extent of their contribution to the chapter. As a result, twenty-five authors from twelve countries and four continents were involved in the creation of the 13 chapters, which enhances the international character of the project and gives an idea of how carefully the Handbook has been developed.

Much of this book is new material required to standardize this mathematics, making this volume a reference tool with broad appeal as well as a platform for future research. Fourteen chapters are organized into three parts: mathematical logic and foundations (Chapters 1-2), general topology (Chapters 3-10), and measure and probability theory (Chapters 11-14). Chapter 1 deals with non-classical logics and their syntactic and semantic foundations. Chapter 2 details the lattice-theoretic foundations of image and preimage powerset operators. Chapters 3 and 4 lay down the axiomatic and categorical foundations of general topology using lattice-valued mappings as a fundamental tool. Chapter 3 focuses on the fixed-basis case, including a convergence theory demonstrating the utility of the underlying axioms. Chapter 4 focuses on the more general variable-basis case, providing a categorical unification of locales, fixed-basis topological spaces, and variable-basis compactifications. Chapter 5 relates lattice-valued topologies to probabilistic topological spaces and fuzzy neighborhood spaces. Chapter 6 investigates the important role of separation axioms in lattice-valued topology from the perspective of space embedding and mapping extension problems, while Chapter 7 examines separation axioms from the perspective of Stone-Cech-compactification and Stone-representation theorems. Chapters 8 and 9 introduce the most important concepts and properties of uniformities, including the covering and entourage approaches and the basic theory of precompact or complete [0,1]-valued uniform spaces. Chapter 10 sets out the algebraic, topological, and uniform structures of the fundamentally important fuzzy real line and fuzzy unit interval. Chapter 11 lays the foundations of generalized measure theory and representation by Markov kernels. Chapter 12 develops the important theory of conditioning operators with applications to measure-free conditioning. Chapter 13 presents elements of pseudo-analysis with applications to the Hamilton & endash;Jacobi equation and optimization problems. Chapter 14 surveys briefly the fundamentals of fuzzy random variables which are [0,1]-valued interpretations of random sets.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In addition, applications to sensitivity analysis of nonlinear programming problems under perturbations are studied. Properties of marginal functions associated with optimization problems are analyzed under quite general constraints defined by means of multivalued mappings. A unified approach to directional differentiability of functions and multifunctions forms the base of the volume. Nonlinear programming problems involving quasidifferentiable functions are considered as well. A significant part of the results are based on theories and concepts of two former Soviet Union researchers, Demyanov and Rubinov, and have never been published in English before.

As the title suggests, special attention is paid to financial objectives and the relationship of financial objectives to project schedules and scheduling. In addition, how schedules relate to other decisions is treated in detail. The book demonstrates that scheduling must be combined with project selection and financing, and that scheduling helps to give an answer to the planning issue of the amount of resources required for a project. The author makes clear the relevance of scheduling to cutting budget costs. The book is divided into six parts. The first part gives a brief introduction to project management. Part two examines scheduling projects in order to maximize their net present value. Part three considers capital rationing. Many decisions on selecting or rejecting a project cannot be made in isolation and multiple projects must be taken fully into account. Since the requests for capital resources depend on the schedules of the projects, scheduling taken on more complexity. Part four studies the resource usage of a project in greater detail. Part five discusses cases where the processing time of an activity is a decision to be made. Part six summarizes the main results that have been accomplished.

Topics covered include the classical (minimax) mono-duality of convex static equilibria, the beautiful bi-duality in dynamical systems, the interesting tri-duality in non-convex problems and the complicated multi-duality in general canonical systems. A potentially powerful sequential canonical dual transformation method for solving fully nonlinear problems is developed heuristically and illustrated by use of many interesting examples as well as extensive applications in a wide variety of nonlinear systems, including differential equations, variational problems and inequalities, constrained global optimization, multi-well phase transitions, non-smooth post-bifurcation, large deformation mechanics, structural limit analysis, differential geometry and non-convex dynamical systems. With exceptionally coherent and lucid exposition, the work fills a big gap between the mathematical and engineering sciences. It shows how to use formal language and duality methods to model natural phenomena, to construct intrinsic frameworks in different fields and to provide ideas, concepts and powerful methods for solving non-convex, non-smooth problems arising naturally in engineering and science. Much of the book contains material that is new, both in its manner of presentation and in its research development. A self-contained appendix provides some necessary background from elementary functional analysis. Audience: The book will be a valuable resource for students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics, mechanics and engineering. The whole volume or selected chapters can also be recommended as a text for both senior undergraduate and graduate courses in applied mathematics, mechanics, general engineering science and other areas in which the notions of optimization and variational methods are employed.

Fuzzy Algorithms for Control,H. B. Verbruggen,mathematics,First published in 1999,/works/OL19851993W?edition=ia%3Afuzzyalgorithmsf00verb_649,/authors/OL1883725A/H._B._Verbruggen,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27040495M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1999|Publisher  Springer Netherlands|Language English|Pages 352,"Fuzzy Algorithms for Control gives an overview of the research results of a number of European research groups that are active and play a leading role in the field of fuzzy modeling and control. It contains 12 chapters divided into three parts. Chapters in the first part address the position of fuzzy systems in control engineering and in the AI community. State-of-the-art surveys on fuzzy modeling and control are presented along with a critical assessment of the role of these methodologists in control engineering. The second part is concerned with several analysis and design issues in fuzzy control systems. The analytical issues addressed include the algebraic representation of fuzzy models of different types, their approximation properties, and stability analysis of fuzzy control systems. Several design aspects are addressed, including performance specification for control systems in a fuzzy decision-making framework and complexity reduction in multivariable fuzzy systems. In the third part of the book, a number of applications of fuzzy control are presented. It is shown that fuzzy control in combination with other techniques such as fuzzy data analysis is an effective approach to the control of modern processes which present many challenges for the design of control systems. One has to cope with problems such as process nonlinearity, time-varying characteristics for incomplete process knowledge. Examples of real-world industrial applications presented in this book are a blast furnace, a lime kiln and a solar plant. Other examples of challenging problems in which fuzzy logic plays an important role and which are included in this book are mobile robotics and aircraft control. The aim of this book is to address both theoretical and practical subjects in a balanced way. It will therefore be useful for readers from the academic world and also from industry who want to apply fuzzy control in practice.

Propositional and predicate logic are presented in an easy-to-read style using Gentzen’s natural deduction. The book proceeds with some basic concepts and facts of model theory: a discussion on compactness, Skolem-Löwenheim, non-standard models and quantifier elimination. The discussion of classical logic is concluded with a concise exposition of second-order logic. In view of the growing recognition of constructive methods and principles, intuitionistic logic and Kripke semantics is carefully explored. A number of specific constructive features, such as apartness and equality, the Gödel translation, the disjunction and existence property are also included. The last chapter on Gödel's first incompleteness theorem is self-contained and provides a systematic exposition of the necessary recursion theory. This new edition has been properly revised and contains a new section on ultra-products.  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

More recently, once basic issues about PDE's, such as existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions, have been understood quite well, research on topological and/or geometric properties of their solutions has become more intense. The study of these issues is attracting the interest of an increasing number of researchers and is now a broad and well-established research area, with contributions that often come from experts from disparate areas of mathematics, such as differential and convex geometry, functional analysis, calculus of variations, mathematical physics, to name a few. This volume collects a selection of original results and informative surveys by a group of international specialists in the field, analyzes new trends and techniques and aims at promoting scientific collaboration and stimulating future developments and perspectives in this very active area of research.

Brief introductions to Plücker coordinates and Grassmann coordinates are also presented.This book looks carefully at linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic figures in two, three and higher dimensions. It deals at length with the extensions and consequences of basic theorems such as those of Pappus and Desargues. The emphasis throughout is on special configurations that have particularly interesting symmetry properties.  The intricate and novel ideas of H S M Coxeter, who is considered one of the great geometers of the twentieth century, are also discussed throughout the text. The book concludes with a useful analysis of finite geometries and a description of some of the remarkable configurations discovered by Coxeter. This book will be appreciated by mathematics undergraduate students and those wishing to learn more about the subject of geometry. Subject and theorems that are often considered quite complicated are made accessible and presented in an easy-to-read and enjoyable manner.

In particular, one of the phenomena studied is the bifurcation of periodic orbits from a singular point or a polycycle. The following topics are discussed in the book: Divergent series and resummation techniques with applications, in particular to the proofs of the finiteness conjecture of Dulac saying that polynomial vector fields on R2 cannot possess an infinity of limit cycles. The proofs work in the more general context of real analytic vector fields on the plane. Techniques in the study of unfoldings of singularities of vector fields (blowing up, normal forms, desingularization of vector fields). Local dynamics and nonlocal bifurcations. Knots and orbit genealogies in three-dimensional flows. Bifurcations and applications: computational studies of vector fields. Holomorphic differential equations in dimension two. Studies of real and complex polynomial systems and of the complex foliations arising from polynomial differential equations. Applications of computer algebra to dynamical systems.

Modern simulation tools are not used only by experts, however, and reliability has therefore become an important issue, meaning that it is not sufficient for a simulation package merely to print out some numbers, claiming them to be the desired results. An estimate of the associated error is also needed. The errors may derive from many sources: errors in the model, errors in discretization, rounding errors, etc. Unfortunately, this situation does not obtain for current packages and there is a great deal of room for improvement. Only if the error can be estimated is it possible to do something to reduce it. The contributions in this book cover many aspects of the subject, the main topics being error estimates and error control in numerical linear algebra algorithms (closely related to the concept of condition numbers), interval arithmetic and adaptivity for continuous models.

The economic implications of the advent of artificial intelligence, such as its effect on prices and wages, appropriate patent policy, and the possibility of accelerating productivity, are discussed. The growing field of artificial economics and the use of artificial agents in experimental economics is considered.​   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Distributed Fuzzy Control of Multivariable Systems,Alexander Gegov,mathematics,First published in 1996,/works/OL19843751W?edition=ia%3Adistributedfuzzy00gego,/authors/OL455593A/Alexander_Gegov,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27032863M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  Springer Netherlands|Language English|Pages 185,"This research monograph presents the fundamentals of fuzzy control theory and recent results in extending fuzzy control theory for multivariable and large scale systems. Among the topics presented are: the problem of dimensional reduction of fuzzy relations; the possibilities for decomposing multivariable systems for the purpose of distributed fuzzy control; a method of two-level hierarchical fuzzy control, based on local and global control components; methods of decentralized fuzzy control by different types of spatial decomposition of the original system into subsystems, and, analogously, methods of multilayer fuzzy control on the basis of several types of temporal decomposition of the original system into layers. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples and two case studies. It is shown that the number of fuzzy relations, respectively on-line computations, can be significantly reduced and in this way real time control implementation can be facilitated. The book is written using a structured method-algorithm-example format, and offers solutions to existing problems, as well as pointing a way to further investigations. Audience: This volume will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in the field of applied mathematics, industrial engineering and informatics.

Introduction to combinatorial testing,D. Richard Kuhn,mathematics,First published in 2013,/works/OL23291359W,/authors/OL3093970A/D._Richard_Kuhn,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English|Pages 319,"""Combinatorial testing of software analyzes interactions among variables using a very small number of tests. This advanced approach has demonstrated success in providing strong, low-cost testing in real-world situations. Introduction to Combinatorial Testing presents a complete self-contained tutorial on advanced combinatorial testing methods for real-world software.The book introduces key concepts and procedures of combinatorial testing, explains how to use software tools for generating combinatorial tests, and shows how this approach can be integrated with existing practice. Detailed explanations and examples clarify how and why to use various techniques. Sections on cost and practical considerations describe tradeoffs and limitations that may impact resources or funding. While the authors introduce some of the theory and mathematics of combinatorial methods, readers can use the methods without in-depth knowledge of the underlying mathematics.Accessible to undergraduate students and researchers in computer science and engineering, this book illustrates the practical application of combinatorial methods in software testing. Giving pointers to freely available tools and offering resources on a supplementary website, the book encourages readers to apply these methods in their own testing projects""--  ""Software testing has always faced a seemingly intractable problem: for real-world programs, the number of possible input combinations can exceed the number of atoms in the universe, so as a practical matter it is impossible to show through testing that the program works correctly for all inputs. Combinatorial testing offers a (partial) solution. Empirical data show that the number of variables involved in failures is small. Most failures are triggered by only one or two inputs, and the number of variables interacting tails off rapidly, a relationship called the interaction rule. Therefore if we test input combinations for even small numbers of variables, we can provide very strong testing at low cost. As always, there is no ""silver bullet"" answer to the problem of software assurance, but combinatorial testing has grown rapidly because it works in the real world""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The first chapters consider fundamental concepts and definitions essential to understanding the fate and effects of toxicants at various levels of ecological organization as covered in the remaining chapters. Scientific ecotoxicology and associated topics are defined. The historical perspective, rationale, and characteristics are outlined for the strong inferential and quantitative approach advocated in this book. The general measurement process is discussed, and methodologies for defining and controlling variance, which could otherwise exclude valid conclusions regarding ecotoxicological endeavors, are considered.Ecotoxicological concepts at increasing levels of ecological organization are discussed in the second part of the book. Quantitative methods used to measure toxicant effects are outlined in this section. The final chapter summarizes the book with a brief discussion of ecotoxicological assessment. Numerous figures and tables accompany text, with many statistical tables found in the appendix for quick reference. Although the book primarily focuses on aquatic systems, with appropriate modification the concepts and methods can be applied to terrestrial systems""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As deterministic versions of the Monte Carlo method, quasi-Monte Carlo rules have increased in popularity, with many fruitful applications in mathematical practice. These rules require nodes with good uniform distribution properties, and digital nets and sequences in the sense of Niederreiter are known to be excellent candidates. Besides the classical theory, the book contains chapters on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and weighted integration, duality theory for digital nets, polynomial lattice rules, the newest constructions by Niederreiter and Xing and many more. The authors present an accessible introduction to the subject based mainly on material taught in undergraduate courses with numerous examples, exercises and llustrations""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The content is here arithmetic and the emphasis is on a constructive logic of arithmetic (arithmetical logic). Kronecker's general arithmetic of forms (polynomials) together with Fermat's infinite descent is put to use in an internal consistency proof. The view is developed in the context of a radical arithmetization of mathematics and logic and covers the many-faceted heritage of Kronecker's work, which includes not only Hilbert, but also Frege, Cantor, Dedekind, Husserl and Brouwer. The book will be of primary interest to logicians, philosophers and mathematicians interested in the foundations of mathematics and the philosophical implications of constructivist mathematics. It may also be of interest to historians, since it covers a fifty-year period, from 1880 to 1930, which has been crucial in the foundational debates and their repercussions on the contemporary scene.

He made fundamental contributions to combinatorial analysis, and trained several generations of mathematicians in his long teaching and research career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Rota's philosophical works, inspired by phenomenology, seek to comprehend and overcome the fracture between the analytic tradition and continental philosophy while tackling problems relative to the transcendental structure of science. This book is the first study that examines Rota's philosophical reflection in the light of Husserl's notion of Fundierung, technological conquest, and the debate that has characterized the connection between science and mathematics in the second half of the century. By its particular position at the border between various spheres and disciplines, the work presented here ranges from contemporary philosophy, epistemology, psychology, and mathematics to scientific questions in general""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In The Norm Chronicles, journalist Michael Blastland and risk expert David Spiegelhalter explore these questions through the stories of average Norm and an ingenious measurement called the MicroMort-a one in a million chance of dying. They reveal why general anesthesia is as dangerous as a parachute jump, giving birth in the US is nearly twice as risky as in the UK, and that the radiation from eating a banana shaves 3 seconds off your life. An entertaining guide to the statistics of personal risk, The Norm Chronicles will enlighten anyone who has ever worried about the dangers we encounter in our daily lives""--  ""Is it safer to fly or take the train?

Special focus is laid on the representation of SFC and on resulting algorithms. For example, grammar-based techniques are introduced for traversals of Cartesian and octree-type meshes, and arithmetisation of SFC is explained to compute SFC mappings and indexings.­The locality properties of SFC are discussed in detail, together with their importance for algorithms. Templates for parallelisation and cache-efficient algorithms are presented to reflect the most important applications of SFC in scientific computing. Special attention is also given to the interplay of adaptive mesh refinement and SFC, including the structured refinement of triangular and tetrahedral grids. For each topic, a short overview is given on the most important publications and recent research activities.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Systems with Hysteresis,Mark A.

They reflect memory effects and process irreversibility. The use of hysteresis operators (hysterons) offers an approach to macroscopic modelling of the dynamics of phase transitions and rheological systems. The applications cover processes in electromagnetism, elastoplasticity and population dynamics in particular. Hysterons are also typical elements of control systems where they represent thermostats and other discontinuous controllers with memory. The book offers the first systematic mathematical treatment of hysteresis nonlinearities. Construction procedures are set up for hysterons in various function spaces, in continuous and discontinuous cases. A general theory of variable hysterons is developed, including identification and stability questions. Both deterministic and non-deterministic hysterons are considered, with applications to the study of feedback systems. Many of the results presented - mostly obtained by the authors and their scientific group - have not been published before. The book is essentially self contained and is addressed both to researchers and advanced students.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Written after many years of lecturing to mathematicians, physicists and engineers in scientific research institutions in Europe and the USA, it uses elementary concepts to present the spherical harmonics in a theory of invariants of the orthogonal group. One of the highlights of this book is the extension of the classical results of the spherical harmonics into the complex. This is particularly important for the complexification of the Funk-Hecke formula which successfully leads to new integrals for Bessel- and Hankel functions with many applications of Fourier integrals and Radon transforms. Exercises have been included to stimulate mathematical ingenuity and to bridge the gap between well known elementary results and their appearance in the new formations.

For such environments, we suggest the use of the robustness approach to decision making, which assumes inadequate knowledge of the decision maker about the random state of nature and develops a decision that hedges against the worst contingency that may arise. Robust Discrete Optimization is a comprehensive mathematical programming framework for robust decision making. This book takes a giant first step in presenting decision support tools and solution methods for generating robust decisions in a variety of interesting application environments such as: linear programming, assignment problems, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, knapsack problems, resource allocation, scheduling, production planning, location, inventory, layout planning, network design, and international sourcing. Beyond theoretical results, the book provides many suggestions and useful advice to the practitioners of the robustness approach. Emphasis is placed upon the assessment of the decision environment for applicability of the approach, structuring of data uncertainty and the scenario generation process, choice of appropriate robustness criteria, and formulation and solution of robust decision problems. Audience: The book will be of interest to researchers, practitioners and graduate students working in the fields of operations research, management science, industrial and systems engineering, computer science, decision analysis and applied mathematics.

The authors then use the Baire category theorem to illustrate several points, including the existence of Besicovitch sets. The second half of the book introduces readers to other central topics in analysis, such as probability theory and Brownian motion, which culminates in the solution of Dirichlet's problem. The concluding chapters explore several complex variables and oscillatory integrals in Fourier analysis, and illustrate applications to such diverse areas as nonlinear dispersion equations and the problem of counting lattice points. Throughout the book, the authors focus on key results in each area and stress the organic unity of the subject.

No other question has ever moved so profoundly the spirit of man; no other idea has so fruitfully stimulated his intellect; yet no other concept stands in greater need of clarification than that of the infinite.' David Hilbert (1862-1943). This interdisciplinary study of infinity explores the concept through the prism of mathematics and then offers more expansive investigations in areas beyond mathematical boundaries to reflect the broader, deeper implications of infinity for human intellectual thought. More than a dozen world-renowned researchers in the fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, philosophy, and theology offer a rich intellectual exchange among various current viewpoints, rather than a static picture of accepted views on infinity. The book starts with a historical examination of the transformation of infinity from a philosophical and theological study to one dominated by mathematics. It then offers technical discussions on the understanding of mathematical infinity. Following this, the book considers the perspectives of physics and cosmology: Can infinity be found in the real universe? Finally, the book returns to questions of philosophical and theological aspects of infinity""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It tries to explain how a mathematical argument and a poem can move us in the same way. Mathematical and poetic techniques are compared, with the aim of showing how they evoke the same sense of beauty.The reader may find that, as Bertrand Russell said, Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty hold and austere, like that of sculpture...sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show.

This methodology combines semidefinite programming with recent results from real algebraic geometry to provide a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging to the desired optimal value. Applied on appropriate cones, standard duality in convex optimization nicely expresses the duality between moments and positive polynomials.

Undocumented secrets of MATLAB-Java programming,Yair M.

Matlab's internal Java classes can often be easily accessed and used by Matlab users. Matlab also enables easy access to external Java functionality, either third-party or user-created. Using Java, we can extensively customize the Matlab environment and application GUI, enabling the creation of very esthetically pleasing applications. Unlike Matlab's interface with other programming languages, the internal Java classes and the Matlab-Java interface were never fully documented by The MathWorks (TMW), the company that manufactures the Matlab product. This is really quite unfortunate: Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, having many times as many programmers as Matlab. Using this huge pool of knowledge and components can significantly improve Matlab applications. As a consultant, I often hear clients claim that Matlab is a fine programming platform for prototyping, but is not suitable for real-world modern-looking applications. This book aimed at correcting this misconception. It shows how using Java can significantly improve Matlab program appearance and functionality and that this can be done easily and even without any prior Java knowledge. In fact, many basic programming requirements cannot be achieved (or are difficult) in pure Matlab, but are very easy in Java. As a simple example, maximizing and minimizing windows is not possible in pure Matlab, but is a trivial one-liner using the underlying Java codeʹ:""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A CAD-free and a CAD-based geometry control system for aerodynamic shape optimization,Daniel Fudge,mathematics,First published in 2004,/works/OL12790535W,/authors/OL5750079A/Daniel_Fudge,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Language English|Pages 58,"The performance of an aerodynamic shape optimization routine is greatly dependent on its geometry control system. This system must accurately parameterize the initial geometry and generate a flexible set of design variables for the optimization cycle. It must also generate new instances of the geometry based on the changes to the design variables dictated by the optimization routine. It is also desirable to generate a new surface grid with the same topology as the original grid in response to changes in the geometry. This new surface grid can be used to perturb the associated volume grid. This thesis develops two geometry control systems, a CAD free system and a CATIA V5 CAD-based system. The two systems provide practical tools for aerodynamic optimization. They also provide a basis for comparing CAD-free and CAD-based systems and understanding additional issues that need to be addressed in order to develop reliable optimization systems.

Notes for a contingent claims theory of limit order markets,Bruce Neal Lehmann,mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL5391853W,/authors/OL1253778A/Bruce_Neal_Lehmann,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper provides a road map for building a contingent claims theory of limit order markets grounded in a simple observation: limit orders are equivalent to a portfolio of cash-or-nothing and asset-or-nothing digital options on market order flow.  However, limit orders are not conventional derivative securities: order flow is an endogenous, non-price state variable; the underlying asset value is a construct, the value of the security in different order flow states; and arbitrage trading or hedging of limit orders is not feasible.  Fortunately, none of these problems is fatal since options on order flow can be conceptualized as bets implicit in limit orders, arbitrage trading can be replaced by limit order substitution, and plausible assumptions can be made about the endogeneity of order flow states and their associated asset values.  The analysis yields two main results: Arrow-Debreu prices for order flow ""states"" are proportional to the slope of the limit order book and the limit order book at one time proves to be identical to that at an earlier time adjusted for the net order flow since that time when all information arrives via trades""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

The first part provides the basic Riesz-Fredholm theory for equations of the second kind with compact operators in dual systems, including all functional analytic concepts necessary. The second part then illustrates the classical applications of integral equation methods to boundary value problems for the Laplace equation and the heat equation as one of the main historical sources for the development of integral equations, and also introduces Cauchy type singular integral equations. The third part describes the fundamental ideas for the numerical solutions of integral equations. In the final part, ill-posed integral equations of the first kind and their regularization are studied in a Hilbert space setting. So that the book is accessible not only to mathematicians but also to physicists and egineers, it is kept as self-contained as possible, requiring only a solid foundation in differential and integral calculus and, for some parts in complex function theory. Some background in functional analysis will be helpful, but the basic concepts needed are reviewed or developed within the book: the reader must of course be willing to accept the modern functional analytic language for describing the theory and the numerical solution of integral equations.

It can be divided into four parts. Noncommutative measure theory is the theme of the first part of the book. The relevant quantum structures are algebraically introduced. This is then used in the axiomatic, geometric model discussed in the second part of the book, where old and partly new groups and finite-dimensional R, C, H-spaces or spheres are studied for particle-series, a bag and the four basic interactions of physics. The third part investigates infinite dimensional spaces, particularly Archimedean and non-Archimedean orthomodular spaces, which generalize classical Hilbert spaces. The last part of the book contains short reviews on related topics which are useful to have at hand. Audience: This volume will be of interest to graduate students and researchers whose work involves mathematics of physics relativity and gravitation, order, lattices, and algebraic structures.

Projektmanagement beschränkt sich nicht auf Netzplantechnik, die freilich ein wichtiges Werkzeug darstellt, sondern wird hier als ganzheitliches Führungskonzept aufgefaßt. Dem Autor liegt besonders die Durchführung mittlerer und kleiner Projekte am Herzen, bei denen bisher die Vorteile des Projektmanagements noch nicht hinreichend erkannt wurden. Die beschriebene Aufwandsreduktion gegenüber Großprojekten wird oft erheblich unterschätzt.

Modern computers allow the implementation of highly accurate ones; hence, their construction and investigation for various boundary value problems in mathematical physics is generating much current interest. The present monograph is devoted to the construction of highly accurate difference schemes for parabolic boundary value problems, based on Padé approximations. The investigation is based on a new notion of positivity of difference operators in Banach spaces, which allows one to deal with difference schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy. Establishing coercivity inequalities allows one to obtain sharp, that is, two-sided estimates of convergence rates. The proofs are based on results in interpolation theory of linear operators. This monograph will be of value to professional mathematicians as well as advanced students interested in the fields of functional analysis and partial differential equations.

Alongside the Laplace transform, the notion of Fourier series is developed from first principles. Exercises are provided to consolidate understanding of the concepts and techniques, and only a knowledge of elementary calculus and trigonometry is assumed. For second and third year students looking for a rigorous and practical introduction to the subject, this book will be an invaluable source.

The key idea is the analysis of problems on the phase space, i.e., the cotangent bundle of the base space. Microlocal analysis is an active area of mathematical research that has been applied to many fields such as real and complex analysis, representation theory, topology, number theory, and mathematical physics. This volume contains the presentations given at a seminar jointly organized by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and Centre National des Recherches Scientifiques entitled New Trends in Microlocal Analysis. The book is divided into three parts: partial differential equations and mathematical analysis, mathematical physics, and algebraic analysis - D-modules and sheave theory. The large variety of new research that is covered will prove invaluable to students and researchers alike.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At one extreme the interest lies in the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and the functional analysis of the proofs of these properties. At the other extreme lies the applied mathematical and engineering quest to find useful solutions, either analytically or numerically, to these important equations which can be used in design and construction. The objective of this book is to actually solve equations rather than discuss the theoretical properties of their solutions. The topics are approached practically, without losing track of the underlying mathematical foundations of the subject. The topics covered include the separation of variables, the characteristic method, D'Alembert's method, integral transforms and Green's functions. Numerous exercises are provided as an integral part of the learning process, with solutions provided in a substantial appendix.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each set of notes presents a self-contained guide to a current research area and has an extensive bibliography. In addition, most of the notes contain detailed proofs of the key results. The notes start from a level suitable for first year graduate students in applied mathematics, mathematical analysis or numerical analysis, and proceed to current research topics. The reader should therefore be able to gain quickly an insight into the important results and techniques in each area without recourse to the large research literature. Current (unsolved) problems are also described and directions for future research are given. This book is also suitable for professional mathematicians who require a succint and accurate account of recent research in areas parallel to their own. Recent graduates in mathematical sciences who are considering the possibility of a pursuing research towards a PhD in applied mathematics or numerical analysis should also find this book a very valuable guide.

The approach is based on first discretizing in the spatial variables by Galerkin's method, using piecewise polynomial trial functions, and then applying some single step or multistep time stepping method. The concern is stability and error analysis of approximate solutions in various norms, and under various regularity assumptions on the exact solution. The book gives an excellent insight in the present ideas and methods of analysis rather than pursuing each approach to its limit. It is essentially self-contained, and simple model situations make it easily accessible even for beginners in the field. Its basis is the author's LNM volume 1054 of 1984, which has been substantially amended.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The main objective is to give a systematic, self-contained presentation on some key issues about the ergodic behavior of that class of Markov chains. These issues include, in particular, the various types of convergence of expected and pathwise occupation measures, and ergodic decompositions of the state space. Some of the results presented appear for the first time in book form. A distinguishing feature of the book is the emphasis on the role of expected occupation measures to study the long-run behavior of Markov chains on uncountable spaces. The intended audience are graduate students and researchers in theoretical and applied probability, operations research, engineering and economics.

In two main topics the book describes what mechanisms allow equilibrium solutions at any agents` preference profiles, and what outcomes can be implemented. The answer depends on the equilibrium concept. Furthermore the four equilibrium concepts Nash equilibrium, strong Nash equilibrium, equilibrium in dominant strategies, and the core were described in detail.

Moreover, they have proved very useful in various areas of mathematics and computer science. This carefully developed book gives a systematic introduction to algebra based on algebraic theories that is accessible to both graduate students and researchers. It will facilitate interactions of general algebra, category theory and computer science. A central concept is that of sifted colimits - that is, those commuting with finite products in sets. The authors prove the duality between algebraic categories and algebraic theories and discuss Morita equivalence between algebraic theories. They also pay special attention to one-sorted algebraic theories and the corresponding concrete algebraic categories over sets, and to S-sorted algebraic theories, which are important in program semantics. The final chapter is devoted to finitary localizations of algebraic categories, a recent research area""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Modern probability theory and the applications of stochastic processes rely heavily on an understanding of basic measure theory. This text is ideal preparation for graduate-level courses in mathematical finance and perfect for any reader seeking a basic understanding of the mathematics underpinning the various applications of Itô calculus""--  ""Undergraduate mathematics syllabi vary considerably in their coverage of measure-theoretic probability theory, so beginning graduates often find substantial gaps in their background when attending modules in advanced analysis, stochastic processes and applications. This text seeks to fill some of these gaps concisely. The exercises form an integral part of the text. The material arose from my experience of teaching AIMS students between 2004 and 2007, of which I retain many fond memories. The AIMS series format allows few explorations of byways; and the objective of arriving at a reasonably honest but concise account of the Itô integral decided most of the material. With motivation from elementary probability we discuss measures and integrals, leading via L2-theory and conditional expectation to discrete martingales and an outline proof of the Radon-Nikodym Theorem. The last two chapters introduce Brownian Motion and Itô integrals, with a brief look at martingale calculus. Here proofs of several key results are only sketched briefly or omitted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model provides the main application. None of the results presented is new; any remaining errors are mine""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Classical topics are blended with new techniques to demonstrate the connections between different fields and highlight current research trends. Example applications drawn from modern research on the thermo-mechanical properties of crystalline solids are used as a unifying focus throughout the text.

They appear whenever the outcomes of one or more categorical variables are observed. A categorical variable can be seen as a variable for which the possible values form a set of categories, which can be finite or, in the case of count data, infinite. These categories can be records of answers (yes/no) in a questionnaire, diagnoses like normal/abnormal resulting from a medical examination or choices of brands in consumer behaviour. Data of this type are common in all sciences that use quantitative research tools, for example social sciences, economics, biology, genetics and medicine, but also engineering and agriculture. In some applications all of the observed variables are categorical and the resulting data can be summarized in contingency tables which contain the counts for combinations of possible outcomes. In other applications categorical data are collected together with continuous variables and one wants to investigate the dependence of one or more categorical variables on continuous and/or categorical variables""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A first course in applied mathematics,Jorge Rebaza,mathematics,First published in 2012,/works/OL16283113W,/authors/OL7037443A/Jorge_Rebaza,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  John Wiley & Sons|Language English,"""This book details how applied mathematics involves predictions, interpretations, analysis, and mathematical modeling to solve real-world problems.  Due to the broad range of applications, mathematical concepts and techniques and reviewed throughout, especially those in linear algebra, matrix analysis, and differential equations.  Some classical definitions and results from analysis are also discussed and used.  Some applications (postscript fonts, information retrieval, etc.) are presented at the end of a chapter as an immediate application of the theory just covered, while those applications that are discussed in more detail (ranking web pages, compression, etc.) are presented in dedicated chapters.  Acollection of mathematical models of a slightly different nature, such as basic discrete mathematics and optimization, is also provided.  Clear proofs of the main theorems ultimately help to make the statements of the theorems more understandable, and a multitude of examples follow important theorems and concepts.  In addition, the author builds material from scratch and thoroughly covers the theory needed to explain the applications in full detail, while not overwhelming readers with unneccessary topics or discussions.  In terms of exercises, the author continuously refers to the real numbers and results in calculus when introducing a new topic so readers can grasp the concept of the otherwise intimidating expressions.  By doing this, the author is able to focus on the concepts rather than the rigor.  The quality, quantity, and varying level of difficulty of the exercises provides instructors more classroom flexibility.  Topical coverage includes linear algebra; ranking web pages; matrix factorizations; least squares; image compression; ordinary differential equations; dynamical systems; and mathematical models""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Multiscale modeling provides a framework, based on fundamental principles, for constructing mathematical and computational models of such phenomena, by examining the connection between models at different scales. This book, by a leading contributor to the field, is the first to provide a unified treatment of the subject, covering, in a systematic way, the general principles of multiscale models, algorithms and analysis. After discussing the basic techniques and introducing the fundamental physical models, the author focuses on the two most typical applications of multiscale modeling: capturing macroscale behavior and resolving local events.

This book, by one of the leading contributors to the field, is the first to provide a unified treatment of the subject, covering, in a systematic way, the general principles of multiscale models, algorithms and analysis. The book begins with a discussion of the analytical techniques in multiscale analysis, including matched asymptotics, averaging, homogenization, renormalization group methods and the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. A summary of the classical numerical techniques that use multiscale ideas is also provided. This is followed by a discussion of the physical principles and physical laws at different scales. The author then focuses on the two most typical applications of multiscale modeling: capturing macroscale behavior and resolving local events. The treatment is complemented by chapters that deal with more specific problems, ranging from differential equations with multiscale coefficients to time scale problems and rare events. Each chapter ends with an extensive list of references to which the reader can refer for further details.

It describes a new approach (based on generalized linear models) which is natural extension of the technique of logistic regression (a method widely used for the prediction of dichotomous events). As an example, the method is applied to the prediction of tropical storm imminence, and the performance of the method is compared with that of alternative well-established techniques.

Each run of a      numerical model produces forecasts of meteorological variables which are used as preliminary      predictions of the future values of these variables. These initial predictions are referred to as      first-guess values. Estimation of the mean-square first-guess error is required in the optimal      interpolation process in the numerical prediction of atmospheric variables. Several predictors      for the mean-square error of the first-guess wind speeds are studied. The results suggest that      prediction using observed covariates tend to be better than those using first-guess covariates.      However, observed covariates are not always available. Predictions using first-guess      covariates are better at the 250 mb level than the 850 or 500 mb levels. Of those first-guess      covariates studied, first-guess wind speed appears to be the best.

His aim is to present calculus as the first real encounter with mathematics: it is the place to learn how logical reasoning combined with fundamental concepts can be developed into a rigorous mathematical theory rather than a bunch of tools and techniques learned by rote. Since analysis is a subject students traditionally find difficult to grasp, Spivak provides leisurely explanations, a profusion of examples, a wide range of exercises and plenty of illustrations in an easy-going approach that enlightens difficult concepts and rewards effort. Calculus will continue to be regarded as a modern classic, ideal for honours students and mathematics majors, who seek an alternative to doorstop textbooks on calculus, and the more formidable introductions to real analysis.

The purpose of this book is to impart the concepts that underlie the mathematics they are likely to encounter and to unfold the notation in a way that removes that particular barrier completely. This book is a primer for developing the skills to enable humanist scholars to address complicated technical material with confidence. This book, to put it plainly, is concerned with the things that the author of a technical article knows, but isn’t saying. Like any field, mathematics operates under a regime of shared assumptions, and it is our purpose to elucidate some of those assumptions for the newcomer.  The individual subjects we tackle are (in order): logic and proof, discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, probability and statistics, calculus, and differential equations. This is not at all the order in which these subjects are usually taught in school curricula, and indeed, it is possible to take a course of study that does not include all of them. Our ordering is borne of our own sense of how best to convey the concepts of mathematics to humanists, and is, like mathematics itself, strongly cumulative.

A brief history of mathematical thought,Luke Heaton,mathematics,First published in 2017,/works/OL19747324W,/authors/OL7537995A/Luke_Heaton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 321,"""Emblazoned on many advertisements for the wildly popular game of Sudoku are the reassuring words, ""no mathematical knowledge required."" Anxiety about math plagues many of us, and school memories can still summon intense loathing. In A Brief History of Mathematical Thought, Luke Heaton shows that much of what many think-and fear-about mathematics is misplaced, and to overcome our insecurities we need to understand its history. To help, he offers a lively guide into and through the world of mathematics and mathematicians, one in which patterns and arguments are traced through logic in a language grounded in concrete experience. Heaton reveals how Greek and Roman mathematicians like Pythagoras, Euclid, and Archimedes helped shaped the early logic of mathematics; how the Fibonacci sequence, the rise of algebra, and the invention of calculus are connected; how clocks, coordinates, and logical padlocks work mathematically; and how, in the twentieth century, Alan Turing's revolutionary work on the concept of computation laid the groundwork for the modern world. A Brief History of Mathematical Thought situates mathematics as part of, and essential to, lived experience. Understanding it requires not abstract thought or numbing memorization but an historical imagination and a view to its origins"" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On September 8, 2017, the Oakland A's faced off against the Houston Astros in a game that would signal the passing of the Moneyball mantle. Though this was only one regular season game, the match-up of these two teams demonstrated how Major League Baseball has changed since the early days of Athletics general manager Billy Beane and the publication of Michael Lewis' classic book. Over the past twenty years, power and analytics have taken over the game, driving carefully calibrated teams like the Astros to victory. Seemingly every pitcher now throws mid-90s heat and studiously compares their mechanics against the ideal. Every batter in the lineup can crack homers and knows their launch angles. Teams are relying on unorthodox strategies, including using power-losing--purposely tanking a few seasons to get the best players in the draft. As he chronicles each inning and the unfolding drama as these two teams continually trade the lead--culminating in a 9-8 Oakland victory in the bottom of the ninth--Neyer considers the players and managers, the front office machinations, the role of sabermetrics, and the current thinking about what it takes to build a great team, to answer the most pressing questions fans have about the sport today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

It covers a wide range of topics, including analysis on multidimensional Euclidean domains and Riemannian symmetric spaces of arbitrary ranks as well as recent work on phase space and the Heisenberg group. The book includes many significant recent results, some of them hitherto unpublished, among which can be pointed out uniqueness theorems for various classes of functions, far-reaching generalizations of the two-radii problem, the modern versions of the Pompeiu problem, and explicit reconstruction formulae in problems of integral geometry. These results are intriguing and useful in various fields of contemporary mathematics. The proofs given are “minimal” in the sense that they involve only those concepts and facts which are indispensable for the essence of the subject. Each chapter provides a historical perspective on the results presented and includes many interesting open problems. Readers will find this book relevant to harmonic analysis on homogeneous spaces, invariant spaces theory, integral transforms on symmetric spaces and the Heisenberg group, integral equations, special functions, and transmutation operators theory.

The category of papers on pseudo-differential operators contains such topics as elliptic operators assigned to diffeomorphisms of smooth manifolds, analysis on singular manifolds with edges, heat kernels and Green functions of sub-Laplacians on the Heisenberg group and Lie groups with more complexities than but closely related to the Heisenberg group, L p-boundedness of pseudo-differential operators on the torus, and pseudo-differential operators related to time-frequency analysis. The second group of papers contains various classes of distributions and algebras of generalized functions with applications in linear and nonlinear differential equations, initial value problems and boundary value problems, stochastic and Malliavin-type differential equations. This second group of papers is related to the third collection of papers via the setting of Colombeau-type spaces and algebras in which microlocal analysis is developed by means of techniques in asymptotics. The volume contains the synergies of the three areas treated and is a useful complement to its predecessors published in the same series.

It has long been recognized as an important factor affecting ecosystem dynamics. Dispersal is apparently a phenomenon of biological origin; however, because of its complexity, it cannot be studied comprehensively by biological methods alone. Deeper insights into dispersal properties and implications require interdisciplinary approaches involving biologists, ecologists and mathematicians. The purpose of this book is to provide a forum for researches with different backgrounds and expertise and to ensure further advances in the study of dispersal and spatial ecology. This book is unique in its attempt to give an overview of dispersal studies across different spatial scales, such as the scale of individual movement, the population scale and the scale of communities and ecosystems. It is written by top-level experts in the field of dispersal modeling and covers a wide range of problems ranging from the identification of Levy walks in animal movement to the implications of dispersal on an evolutionary timescale.

We provide an initial analysis of the prices of these options. We find that market-based measures of expectations are similar to survey-based forecasts although the market-based measures somewhat more accurately predict financial market responses to surprises in data. These markets also provide implied probabilities of the full range of specific outcomes, allowing us to measure uncertainty, assess its driving forces, and compare this measure of uncertainty with the dispersion of point-estimates among individual forecasters (a measure of disagreement). We also assess the accuracy of market-generated probability density forecasts. A consistent theme is that few of the behavioral anomalies present in surveys of professional forecasts survive in equilibrium, and that these markets are remarkably well calibrated. Finally we assess the role of risk, finding little evidence that risk-aversion drives a wedge between market prices and probabilities in this market""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

Firm-specific capital and the new Keynesian Phillips curve,"Woodford, Michael Professor.",mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL5891853W,/authors/OL1453125A/Woodford_Michael_Professor.,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""A relation between inflation and the path of average marginal cost (often measured by unit labor cost) implied by the Calvo (1983) model of staggered pricing --- sometimes referred to as the ""new-Keynesian Phillips curve""--- has been the subject of extensive econometric estimation and testing.  Standard theoretical justifications of this form of aggregate-supply relation, however, either assume (i) the existence of a competitive rental market for capital services, so that the shadow cost of capital services is equated across firms and sectors at all points in time, despite the fact that prices are set at different times, or (ii) that the capital stock of each firm is constant, or at any rate exogenously given, and so independent of the firm's pricing decision.  But neither assumption is realistic.  The present paper examines the extent to which existing empirical specifications and interpretations of parameter estimates are compromised by reliance on either of these assumptions.The paper derives an aggregate-supply relation for a model with monopolistic competition and Calvo pricing in which capital is firm-specific and endogenous, and investment is subject to convex adjustment costs.  The aggregate-supply relation is shown to again take the standard ""new-Keynesian"" form, but with an elasticity of inflation with respect to real marginal cost that is a different function of underlying parameters than in the simpler cases studied earlier.  Thus the relations estimated in the empirical literature remain correctly specified under the assumptions proposed here, but the interpretation of the estimated elasticity is different; in particular, the implications of the estimated Phillips-curve slope for the frequency of price adjustment is changed.  Assuming a rental market for capital results in a substantial exaggeration of the infrequency of price adjustment; assuming exogenous capital instead results in a smaller under-estimate""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Our model captures three key features of interest rates: the opportunity cost of attacking the currency responds to the investors' behavior; the domestic interest rate may influence the central bank's preferences for a fixed exchange rate; and the domestic interest rate serves as a public signal which aggregates private information about fundamentals.  We explore the payoff and informational channels through which interest rates determine devaluation outcomes, and examine the implications for equilibrium selection by global games methods.  Our main conclusion is that multiplicity is not an artifact of common knowledge.  In particular, we show that multiplicity emerges robustly, either when a devaluation is triggered by the cost of high domestic interest rates as in Obstfeld (1996), or when a devaluation is triggered by the central bank's loss of foreign reserves as in Obstfeld (1986), provided that the domestic asset supply is sufficiently elastic in the interest rate and shocks to the domestic bond supply are sufficiently small""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We offer a microeconomic perspective on the fiscal theory by computing a Slutsky-Hicks decomposition of the effects of tax changes into substitution, wealth, and revaluation effects.  Revaluation effects arise whenever tax changes alter the value of outstanding nominal government liabilities by changing the price level.  Under certain assumptions on monetary and fiscal behavior, the revaluation effect reflects the fiscal theory mechanism.  When taxes distort, two Laffer curves arise, implying that a tax increase can lower or raise the price level and the revaluation effect can be positive or negative, depending on which side of a particular Laffer curve the economy resides""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We develop and estimate an empirical model based on the ICAPM to investigate this relation.  Our primary innovation is to model and identify empirically the two components of expected returns--the risk component and the component due to the desire to hedge changes in investment opportunities.  We also explicitly model the effect of shocks to expected returns on ex post returns and use implied volatility from traded options to increase estimation efficiency.  As a result, the coefficient of relative risk aversion is estimated more precisely, and we find it to be positive and reasonable in magnitude.  Although volatility risk is priced, as theory dictates, it contributes only a small amount to the time-variation in expected returns.  Expected returns are driven primarily by the desire to hedge changes in investment opportunities.  It is the omission of this hedge component that is responsible for the contradictory and counter-intuitive results in the existing literature""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site.

Others argue that urban decline harms the poor by reducing job opportunities, the quality of local public services, and other neighborhood amenities.  While both decay and revitalization can have negative effects if moving costs are sufficiently high, in general the impact of neighborhood change on utility depends on the strength of price responses to neighborhood quality changes.  Data from the American Housing Survey are used to estimate a discrete choice model identifying households' willingness-to-pay for neighborhood quality.  These willingness-to-pay estimates are then compared to the actual price changes that accompany observed changes in neighborhood quality.  The results suggest that price increases associated with revitalization are smaller than most households' willingness to pay for neighborhood improvements.

Bounds in competing risks models and the war on cancer,Bo E.

Thirty years later, many have declared this war a failure.  Overall cancer statistics confirm this view: age-adjusted mortality in 2000 was essentially unchanged from the early 1970s.  At the same time, age-adjusted mortality rates from cardiovascular disease have fallen quite dramatically.  Since the causes underlying cancer and cardiovascular disease are likely to be correlated, the decline in mortality rates from cardiovascular disease may be somewhat responsible for the rise in cancer mortality.  It is natural to model mortality with more than one cause of death as a competing risks model.  Such models are fundamentally unidentified, and it is therefore difficult to get a clear picture of the progress in cancer.  This paper derives bounds for aspects of the underlying distributions under a number of different assumptions.  Most importantly, we do not assume that the underlying risks are independent, and impose weak parametric assumptions in order to obtain identification.  The theoretical contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to estimate competing risk models with interval data and discrete explanatory variables, both of which are common in empirical applications.  We use our method to estimate changes in cancer and cardiovascular mortality since 1970.  The estimated bounds for the effect of time on the duration until death for either cause are fairly tight and we find that trends in cancer show much larger improvements than previously estimated.  For example, we find that time until death from cancer increased by about 10% for white males and 20% for white women""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

According to the selection hypothesis, analysts pick their favorite stocks and are truly too optimistic. According to the conflict-of-interest hypothesis, analysts distort their view to maximize profits via commissions and underwriting business, in particular if affiliated with an underwriting bank. We analyze the concurrent issuance of recommendations and earnings forecasts to assess the relative importance of both explanations for affiliated and for unaffiliated analysts. First, we show that recommendations and forecasts reach different audiences. Small traders follow recommendations but not forecast updates; large traders discount recommendations and follow earnings forecasts. As a result, analysts may choose to distort recommendations but prove their analyst quality in their forecasts. The selection hypothesis implies, instead, a positive correlation between recommendation and forecast overoptimism. We find that, while affiliated analysts issue more optimistic recommendations than unaffiliated analysts, their earnings forecasts are more pessimistic. Moreover, forecast optimism is negatively correlated with recommendation optimism for affiliated analysts but positively for unaffiliated analysts. Similar discrepancies between the timing of recommendations and forecasts confirm that active distortion is a major explanation for the recommendation optimism of affiliated analysts.""--abstract.

InThe Essence of Chaos Edward Lorenz, one of the founding fathers of Chaos and the originator of its seminal concept of the Butterfly Effect, presents his own landscape of our current understanding of the field. Lorenz presents everyday examples of chaotic behaviour, such as the toss of a coin, the pinball's path, the fall of a leaf, and explains in elementary mathematical strms how their essentially chaotic nature can be understood. His principal example involved the construction of a model of a board sliding down a ski slope. Through this model Lorenz illustrates chaotic phenomena and the related concepts of bifurcation and strange attractors. He also provides the context in which chaos can be related to the similarly emergent fields of nonlinearity, complexity and fractals. As an early pioneer of chaos, Lorenz also provides his own story of the human endeavour in developing this new field. He describes his initial encounters with chaos through his study of climate and introduces many of the personalities who contributed early breakthroughs. His seminal paper, ""Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wing in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"" is published for the first time.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Treatment of each topic is thorough enough to make the coverage self-contained for a course in probability, and exceptional care has been taken to balance theory with applications. In addition to classical probability theory, such modern topics as order statistics and limiting distributions are discussed, along with applied examples from a wide variety of fields. Discussions include the core mathematical statistics topics of estimation, testing, and confidence intervals; ranking and selection procedures; decision theory; nonparametric statistics; regression and ANOVA; and robust statistical procedures. Computer-assisted data analysis is discussed at several points, reflecting the importance of statistical computation to the field. FORTRAN programs and BMDP routines are included, as well as the highly popular SAS routines. Also looks at the potential contribution of expert systems to statistics.

Estimating the expected marginal rate of substitution,Robert P.

Our empirical strategy is general, and allows the EMRS to vary arbitrarily over time.  A novel feature of our technique is that it relies upon exploiting idiosyncratic risk, since theory dictates that idiosyncratic shocks earn the EMRS.  We apply our methodology to two different data sets: monthly data from 1994 through 2003, and daily data for 2003.  Both data sets include assets from three different markets: the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and the Toronto Stock Exchange.  For both monthly and daily frequencies, we find plausible estimates of EMRS with considerable precision and time-series volatility.  We then use these estimates to test for asset integration, both within and between stock markets.  We find that all three markets seem to be internally integrated in the sense that different assets traded on a given market share the same EMRS.  The technique is also powerful enough to reject integration between the three stock markets, and between stock and money markets""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

A multi-country approach to factor-proportions trade and trade costs,James R. Markusen,mathematics,First published in 2005,/works/OL4005737W,/authors/OL738251A/James_R._Markusen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Classic trade questions are reconsidered by generalizing a factor-proportions model to multiple countries, multi-stage production, and country-specific trade costs.  We derive patterns of production specialization and trade for a matrix of countries that differ in relative endowments (columns) and trade costs (rows).  We demonstrate how the ability to fragment production and/or a proportional change in all countries' trade costs alters these patterns.  Production specialization and the volume of trade are higher with fragmentation for most countries but interestingly, for a large block of countries, these variables fall following fragmentation.  Countries with moderate trade costs engage in market-oriented assembly, while those with lower trade costs engage in export-platform production.  These two cases correspond to the concepts of horizontal and vertical affiliate production in the literature on multinational enterprises.  Increases in specialization and the volume of trade accelerate as trade costs go to zero with and without fragmentation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We outline a model exemplifying some of these linkages, describe several methods for investigating two-way feedbacks between various categories of trade, and apply them to the recent experience of developing countries.  After controlling for other macroeconomic and institutional effects, we find that the strongest feedback between the sub-accounts is between FDI and manufacturing trade.  More precisely, applying Geweke (1982)%u2019s decomposition method, we find that most of the linear feedback between trade and FDI (81%) can be accounted for by Granger-causality from FDI gross flows to trade openness (50%) and from trade to FDI (31%).

That is, IPO underperformance may result from observing too few star performers ex-post than were expected ex-ante.  We develop a model of IPO performance that captures this intuition by allowing returns to be drawn from mixtures of outstanding, benchmark, or poor performing states.  We estimate the model under the null of no ex-ante average IPO underperformance and construct small sample distributions of various statistics measuring IPO relative performance.  We find that small sample biases are extremely unlikely to account for the magnitude of the post-1970 IPO underperformance observed in data"" National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We focus on the optimal timing of benefits and the desirability of allowing workers to freely access a riskless asset.  When workers have constant absolute risk aversion preferences it is optimal to use a very simple policy: a constant benefit during unemployment, a constant tax during employment that does not depend on the duration of the spell, and free access to savings using a riskless asset.  Away from this benchmark, for constant relative risk aversion preferences, the welfare gains of more elaborate policies are minuscule.  Our results highlight two largely distinct roles for policy toward the unemployed: (a) ensuring workers have sufficient liquidity to smooth their consumption; and (b) providing unemployment benefits that serve as insurance against the uncertain duration of unemployment spells""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Building on these insights, we introduce a parsimonious equilibrium model in which regime-shifts of heterogeneous durations affect the volatility of dividend news.  We estimate tightly parameterized specifications with up to 256 discrete states on daily U.S.  equity returns.  The multifrequency equilibrium has significantly higher likelihood than the classic Campbell and Hentschel (1992) specification, while generating volatility feedback effects 6 to 12 times larger.  We show in an extension that Bayesian learning about stochastic volatility is faster for bad states than good states, providing a novel source of endogenous skewness that complements the ""uncertainty"" channel considered in previous literature (e.g., Veronesi, 1999).  Furthermore, signal precision induces a tradeoff between skewness and kurtosis, and economies with intermediate investor information best match the data""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

The central theme is the notion of control flow with its global dynamics and linearization presented in detail. The book's scope is comprehensive and includes global theory of dynamical systems under time-varying perturbations, global and local dynamics of control systems, connections between control systems and dynamical systems and the relevant numerical methods for global dynamics, linearization, and stability. Topics are developed with a diverse and extensive selection of applied problems from control and dynamical systems. Topics and Features: * complete coverage of unified theory of control flows * wide array of motivating problems from control and dynamical systems to appeal to mathematicians, scientists, and engineers * relevant motivation and a listing of important definitions and results at the beginning of each chapter * a compilation of essential background information in four appendices: nonlinear geometric control, topological theory of dynamical systems, computations of reachable sets, and numerical solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Belman equations * discussion of numerical methods This new text and self-study reference guide is an excellent resource for the foundations and applications of control theory and nonlinear dynamics. All graduates, practitioners, and professionals in control theory, dynamical systems, perturbation theory, engineering, physics, and nonlinear dynamics will find the book a rich source of ideas, methods, and applications.

For the reader familiar with the basic concepts, this volume gives a concise presentation of both conformal and Poincaré supergravity. The consistent four-dimensional supergravity theories are classified. For the practitioner in this field the book will be a valuable source, in particular with respect to the rather awkward formulae needed for further modelling, which have been carefully checked by the author.
