Within the next thirty years, one-third of China's population could be Christian, making China one of the largest Christian nations in the world. These Christians could also be China's leaders, guiding the largest economy in the world. David Aikman recounts the fascinating story of how Christianity began in China (even predating Francis Xavier and the Jesuits), the bloody anti-Christian persecutions (especially under the Communist), the revival of an underground Christian movement led by brave men and women risking death, and the flowering of Christianity today -- though still under persecution. - Publisher.

Julia Ericksen and Sally Steffen reveal that the survey questions asked, more than the answers elicited, expose and shape the popular image of appropriate sexuality. We can learn as much about the history and practice of sexuality by looking at surveyors' changing concerns as we can by reading the results of their surveys. The authors show how surveys have reflected societal anxieties about adolescent development, teen sex and promiscuity, and AIDS, and have been employed in efforts to preserve marriage and to control women's sexuality."" ""Kiss and Tell is an important examination of the role of social science in shaping American sexual patterns. Revealing how surveys of sexual behavior help create the issues they purport merely to describe, it reminds us how malleable and imperfect our knowledge of sexual behavior is.""--BOOK JACKET.

An attitude of love may ot be your top priority in some of these encounters. But what if the ancient maxim ""love your neighbor as yourself"" applied to everyone, including those you meet in the most ordinary circumstances?

Conversations with an unrepentant liberal,Julius Seelye Bixler,religion,First published in 1946,/works/OL5305643W?edition=ia%3Aconversationswit0000bixl,/authors/OL1206533A/Julius_Seelye_Bixler,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL14572793M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1946|Publisher  Yale University Press|Language English|Pages 113,"In 1946 Julius Seelye Bixler presented three Terry Lectures at Yale University.  He later published these as CONVERSATIONS WITH AN UNREPENTANT LIBERAL. In these used the Socratic dialog format to describe the philosophy which guided his life.  He also showed now liberal philosophy forms the basis for liberal religion and the liberal arts.  The arguments made by the protagonoists -- Simmias and Cebes -- ring just as clearly in today's debates between liberals and conservatives as they did in the 1940's.  Bixler was president of Colby College (Waterville, Maine) during 1942 to 1960, serving through wars and peacetime.  During his tenure the college moved its physical campus from downtown Waterville Maine, to a new campus on Mayflower Hill, overlooking the city.  At the same time Colby moved from being a provincial school into the front ranks of liberal arts colleges, where it remains sixty years later.  The 1995 reprint of this book includes three commentaries on three aspects of his life -- philosopher, college president, and member of the academic community.

Sheen, the preeminent teacher, preacher, and pastor of American Catholicism.Called ""the Great Communicator"" by Billy Graham and ""a prophet of the times"" by Pope Pius XII, Sheen was the voice of American Catholicism for nearly fifty years. In addition to his prolific writings, Sheen dominated the airwaves, first in radio, and later television, with his signature program ""Life is Worth Living,"" drawing an average of 30 million viewers a week in the 1950s. Sheen had the ears of everyone from presidents to the common men, women, and children in the pews, and his uplifting message of faith, hope, and love shaped generations of Catholics. Here in Sheen's own words are reflections from his childhood, his years in seminary, his academic career, his media stardom, his pastoral work, his extensive travels, and much more. Readers already familiar with Sheen and as well as those coming to him for the first time will find a fascinating glimpse into the Catholic world Sheen inhabited, and will find inspiration in Sheen's heartfelt recollections. Treasure in Clay is a classic book and a lasting testament to a life that was worth living.   Read more Read less",13 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

In 1291 the fall of Acre marked the loss of the last Christian enclave in the Holy Land. This Pocket Essential traces the chronology of the Crusades between these two dates and highlights the most important figures on all sides of the conflict. It covers the creation of the kingdom of Jerusalem and the other crusader states and their struggle to survive. It looks at the successes and failures of the Third Crusade and at the legendary figures of Richard the Lionheart and Saladin, explores the truth and the myths behind the orders of military monks like the Hospitallers and examines such strange historical events as the Children's Crusade and the crusader sacking of Byzantium in 1204. It also looks at the struggles of the Teutonic Knights against paganism in the Baltic. The book provides the essential information about one of the great unifying, and disunifying, forces of medieval Christendom.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through a painstaking analysis and historical reconstruction of both archeological and literary sources, and drawing on scholarly work that has been unavailable in English, Winroth opens up new avenues for studying European ascendency and the expansion of Christianity in the medieval period""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is the only work where he describes his Christian philosophy. Sheen created this compendium in 1965 in the privacy of his New York City residence at the conclusion of the Second Vatican Council. The series ran over 21 hours on 25 vinyl records. It is his response to millions of letters he received from people around the world writing him in search of truth, salvation, and spiritual guidance and was also conceived to explain his mission to evangelize the world.

Prayer, our conversation with God, needs no set formulas or flowery phrases. It often needs no words at all. But for most believers, the words of others can be a wonderful aid to devotion, especially when these words come front faithful fellow pilgrims. The African Prayer Book is just such an aid, for in this collection all the spiritual riches of the vast and varied continent of Africa are bravely set forth. Here we may delight in Solomon's splendid encounter with the Queen of Sheba, overhear the simple prayer of a penniless Bushman, and glory in the sensuous sonorities of the mysterious liturgies of the Egyptian Copts. Here are Jesus' own encounters with Africa, which provided him refuge at the beginning of his life (from the murderous King Herod) and aid at its end (in the person of Simon of Cyrene, who helped Jesus carry his cross). Here are the prayers of some of the greatest among the mothers and fathers of the Church -- Monica, Augustine, Clement of Alexandria, Cyprian of Carthag -- as well as the prayers from the African diasporas of North America and the Caribbean. From thunderous multi-invocation litanies to quiet meditations, here are prayers that every heart can speak with strength and confidence. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is for millions the very soul of Africa, is our guide on this unique spiritual journey. His introduction is destined to become a classic, his characteristic energy and optimism light our way, and the words of his favorite prayers (many composed by the Archbishop himself) will stay with us forever.From the Hardcover edition.

This work explores the differing perspectives arising from a changing social and academic culture. Key issues concerning early Christianity are addressed, such as how early Christian accounts of pagans, Jews and heretics can be challenged and the degree to which Christian groups offered support to their members and to those in need. The work examines how non-Christians reacted to the spectacle of martyrdom and to Christian reverence for relics. Questions are also raised about why some Christians encouraged others to abandon wealth, status and gender-roles for extreme ascetic lifestyles and about whether Christian preachers trained in classical culture offered moral education to all or only to the social elite. The interdisciplinary and thematic approach offers the student of early Christianity a comprehensive treatment of its role and influence in Roman society.

In The Altar of My Soul, Marta Moreno Vega recounts the compelling true story of her journey from ignorance and skepticism to initiation as a Yoruba priestess in the Santeria religion. This unforgettable spiritual memoir reveals the long-hidden roots and traditions of a centuries-old faith that originated on the shores of West Africa.As an Afro-Puerto Rican child in the New York barrio, Marta paid little heed to the storefront botanicas full of spiritual paraphernalia or to the Catholic saints with foreign names: Yemaya, Ellegua, Shango. As an adult, in search of a religion that would reflect her racial and cultural heritage, Marta was led to the Way of the Saints. She came to know Santeria intimately through its prayers and rituals, drumming and dancing, trances and divination that spark sacred healing energy for family, spiritual growth, and service to others. Written by one who is a professor and a santera priestess, The Altar of My Soul lays before us an electrifying and inspiring faith--one passed down from generation to generation that vitalizes the sacred energy necessary to build a family, a community, and a strong, loving society.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Dating from thirteenth-century records of Japan's Kamakura temples, and traditionally guarded with a reverent secrecy, they reflect the earliest manifestation of pure Zen in Japan. Created by Zen Masters for their warrior pupils, the Japanese Koans use incidents from everyday life - a broken tea-cup, a water-jar, a cloth - to bring the warrior pupils of the Samurai to the Zen realization. Their aim is to enable a widening of consciouness beyond the illusions of the limited self, and a joyful inspiration in life - a state that has been compared to being free under a blue sky after imprisonment.

Using timeless biblical texts as lenses to see the present, she helps us understand who we are and who God is for us by exploring the tightly interwoven basic elements of our lives--our love, suffering, work, bodies, prayer, community, and experiences of death.   Through the process of seeing our experiences in relation to Biblical stories, we begin to recognize our lives as part of the ongoing story of the Jewish people--as Torah. This insight allows us to see these experiences as meaningful, not accidental, and opens us to recognizing God's power in and through all that happens to us. Rather than a collection of random events, our lives are part of the Jewish people's ongoing adventure. Armed with our personally shaped theology, we can face this adventure of living in th...

Alec Ryrie provides the first comprehensive account of what it actually meant to live a Protestant life in England and Scotland between c. 1530-1640, drawing on a rich mixture of contemporary devotional works, sermons, diaries, biographies, and autobiographies to uncover the lived experience of early modern Protestantism. Beginning from the surprisingly urgent, multifaceted emotions of Protestantism, Ryrie explores practices of prayer, of family and public worship, and of reading and writing, tracking them through the life course from childhood through conversion and vocation to the deathbed. He examines what Protestant piety drew from its Catholic predecessors and contemporaries, and grounds that piety in material realities such as posture, food and tears. This perspective shows us what it meant to be Protestant in the British Reformations: a meeting of intensity (a religion which sought authentic feeling above all, and which dreaded hypocrisy and hard-heartedness) with dynamism (a progressive religion, relentlessly pursuing sanctification and dreading idleness). That combination, for good or ill, gave the Protestant experience its particular quality of restless, creative zeal. The Protestant devotional experience also shows us that this was a broad-based religion: for all the differences across time, between two countries, between men and women, and between puritans and conformists, this was recognisably a unified culture, in which common experiences and practices cut across supposed divides. Alec Ryrie shows us Protestantism, not as the preachers on all sides imagined it, but as it was really lived. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jackson notes that no one has offered a convincing explanation of why Islam spread among Blackamericans (a coinage he explains and defends) but not among white Americans or Hispanics. Theassumption has been that there is an African connection. In fact, Jackson shows, none of the distinctive features of African Islam appear in the proto-Islamic, black nationalist movements of the early 20th century. Instead, he argues, Islam owes its momentum to the distinctively American phenomenonof ""Black Religion,"" a God-centered holy protest against anti-black racism.  Islam in Black America begins as part of a communal search for tools with which to combat racism and redefine American blackness...

After tying the legs of the ten remaining girls, Roberts prepared to shoot them execution with an automatic rifle and four hundred rounds of ammunition that he brought for the task. The oldest hostage, a thirteen-year-old, begged Roberts to ""shoot me first and let the little ones go."" Refusing her offer, he opened fire on all of them, killing five and leaving the others critically wounded. He then shot himself as police stormed the building. His motivation? ""I'm angry at God for taking my little daughter,"" he told the children before the massacre.

And a call for urgent action by all Christians today in response. The Color of Compromise is both enlightening and compelling, telling a history we either ignore or just don't know. Equal parts painful and inspirational, it details how the American church has helped create and maintain racist ideas and practices. You will be guided in thinking through concrete solutions for improved race relations and a racially inclusive church. The Color of Compromise: Takes you on a historical, sociological, and religious journey: from America's early colonial days through slavery and the Civil War; Covers the tragedy of Jim Crow laws, the victories of the Civil Rights era, and the strides of today's Black Lives Matter movement; Reveals the cultural and institutional tables we have to flip in order to bring about meaningful integration; Charts a path forward to replace established patterns and systems of complicity with bold, courageous, immediate action; Is a perfect book for pastors and other faith leaders, students, non-students, book clubs, small group studies, history lovers, and all lifelong learners. The Color of Compromise is not a call to shame or a platform to blame white evangelical Christians. It is a call from a place of love and desire to fight for a more racially unified church that no longer compromises what the Bible teaches about human dignity and equality. A call that challenges black and white Christians alike to standup now and begin implementing the concrete ways Tisby outlines, all for a more equitable and inclusive environment among God's people.

The concept of the Messiah in the scriptures of Judaism and Christianity,Shirley Lucass,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16487987W,/authors/OL7073147A/Shirley_Lucass,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  T&T Clark International|Language English|Pages 236,"For 2000 years Judaism and Christianity have been at odds with one another. The problem at the heart of the division is the concept of messiah. Shirley Lucass looks directly at the concept of messiah from an historical perspective and examines its roots in ancient Jewish literature, and its development within the Christian tradition, aiming not only to trace the biblical and extra-biblical developments of the concept, but to outline a platform for religious dialogue. Lucass begins with a survey of methodological approaches, and then moves on to consider the origins of the messiah concept in ancient near eastern kingship, the 'anointed' in the Second Temple period and the messiah as outlined in the New Testament and in post 70 CE Messianism. Lucass contends that the New Testament concept of messiah is not inconsistent with, nor incompatible with the Jewish antecedent traditions, and it is this conclusion which enables her to present a valuable chapter on the implications of this study for inter-religious dialogue. Lucass does much to clear the path by refuting Supersessionism, highlighting that more is held in common than in difference and calling for an approach that Jews and Christians come together as God's people in constructive dialogue.--Cover p. 4.  In her preface, Lucass notes that ""although such well-known names as Novak and Neusner have consistently been engaged in dialogue, producing various works on the subject, neither of them deals directly with christology. As a result, to my mind, they leave untouched and therefore unanswered the central stumbling block of all Jewish-Christian dialogue: Was Jesus the Messiah? Whilst the ultimate answer to that must be a question of faith, what I have attempted to demonstrate here is simply that he could have been. That is he could have been the expected Messiah of Judaism, one that fits fully into the Jewish expectations of that period, and not the product of Paul's Hellenistic Judaism mixed with elements of the mystery religions, nor a product of the Church's later theologizing. Neither is it my belief that this understanding of the Messiah was 'subsequently transformed as Christianity spread in the Gentile world' (Adela Yarbro Collins and John J. Collins, King and Messiah as Son of God, Grand Rapids: Erdsmans, 2008); rather, I would argue that all that the New Testament writers say about Jesus can be rooted in antecedent Jewish tradition which pre-dates the arrival of Jesus.""--p. xi.

But how does it work? And why? The principles behind this ancient practice have long eluded some of the best minds in modern science. Until now.In this groundbreaking work, world-renowned Buddhist teacher Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche invites us to join him in unlocking the secrets behind the practice of meditation. Working with neuroscientists at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, Yongey Mingyur provides clear insights into modern research indicating that systematic training in meditation can enhance activity in areas of the brain associated with happiness and compassion. He has also worked with physicists across the country to develop a fresh, scientifically based interpretation of the Buddhist understanding of the nature of reality.With an infectious joy and insatiable curiosity, Yongey Mingyur weaves together the principles of Tibetan Buddhism, neuroscience, and quantum physics in a way that will forever change the way we understand the human experience. Using the basic meditation practices he provides, we can discover paths through everyday problems, transforming obstacles into opportunities to recognize the unlimited potential of our own minds.With a foreword by bestselling author Daniel Goleman, The Joy of Living is a stunning breakthrough, an illuminating vision of the science of Buddhism and a handbook for transforming our minds, bodies, and lives.From the Hardcover edition.

It offers a revealing account of Hindu militant mobilizations as an authoritarian movement manifest throughout culture, polity, and economy, religion and law, class and caste, on gender, body, land, and memory. Tracing the continuities between Hindutva and Hindu cultural dominance, this book maps the architectures of civic and despotic governmentalities contouring Hindu nationalism in public, domestic, and everyday life. In chronicling concerted action against Christians and Muslims, Adivasis and Dalits, through spectacles, events, public executions, the riots in Kandhamal of December 2007 and August-September 2008, the planned, methodical politics of terror unfolds in its multiple registers.  This pioneering research was conducted between 2002-2008 in urban and rural settings in the eastern state of Orissa, a primary arena for the onslaught of organized Hindu majoritarianism. Through situated reflection, storytelling, and ethnographic accounts, this genealogical excavation examines Hindutva/Hindu supremacist proliferations in manufacturing imaginative and identitarian agency for violent nationalism.  At the intersections of Anthropology, Postcolonial, Subaltern, and South Asia Studies, Angana P. Chatterji asks critical questions of nation making, cultural nationalism, and subaltern disenfranchisement. As a Foucauldian history of the present, this text asserts the role of ethical knowledge production as counter-memory.  ANGANA P. CHATTERJI is Professor of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco. Her work spans issues of cultural survival, nation/nationalisms, gendered violence, and postcolonial critique. Her recent writings include two forthcoming books, Land and Justice: The Struggle for Cultural Survival, and a co-edited volume, Contesting Nation: Gendered Violence in South Asia; Notes on the Postcolonial Present.

Growing up in a strict Muslim community in south-east London, Alom Shaha learnt that religion was not to be questioned. Reciting the Qur'an without understanding what it meant was simply a part of life; so, too, was obeying the imam and enduring beatings when he failed to attend the local mosque. But Alom was more drawn to science and its power to illuminate. As a teen, he lived between two worlds: the home controlled by his authoritarian father, and a school alive with books and ideas. In a charming blend of memoir, philosophy and science, Alom explores the questions about faith and the afterlife that we all ponder. This is a book for anyone who wonders what they should believe and how they should live. It's for those who may need the facts and the ideas, as well as the courage, to break free from inherited beliefs. In this powerful narrative, Alom shows that it is possible to live a compassionate, fulfilling and meaningful life without God. Foreword by Jim Al-Khalili""--Publisher's description.

When it comes to the end times, do you believe everything will just pan out in the end? It's easy to slip into apathy when it comes to Christ's return, especially since many people in recent years have falsely predicted the end of the world. The danger of false predictions is that they discourage us from preparing for the actual event -- an event that will happen and does matter right now.    As popular Bible teacher Dr. Robert Jeffress shows in Perfect Ending, we may not know when Christ will return, but the Bible offers many details about what the end times look like. Understanding these biblical prophecies not only gives us greater peace about the future, it draws us to God in the present. Strengthen your biblical knowledge and your spiritual life through this powerful look at the future God promises for every follower of Christ.

Frequented by thousands of climbers each year, Cho Oyu lies nineteen miles east of Mt. Everest on the border between Tibet and Nepal. To the elite mountaineering community, it offers a straightforward summit—a warm-up climb to her formidable sister. To Tibetans, Cho Oyu promises a gateway to freedom through a secret glacial path: the Nangpa La. Murder in the High Himalaya is the unforgettable account of the brutal killing of Kelsang Namtso—a seventeen-year-old Tibetan nun fleeing to India—by Chinese border guards. Witnessed by dozens of Western climbers, Kelsang's death sparked an international debate over China's savage oppression of Tibet. Adventure reporter Jonathan Green has gained rare entrance into this shadow-land at the rooftop of the world. In his affecting portrait of modern Tibet, Green raises enduring questions about morality and the lengths we go to achieve freedom.

This book confirms the astonishing truth within the controversial religion. Scientology conjures images of its celebrity believers, its notably aggressive response to criticism or its attacks on psychiatry, and its requirement that believers pay as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars to reach the highest levels of salvation. In Inside Scientology Reitman reveals all, starting with how the singular L. Ron Hubbard transformed a self-help group into a worldwide spiritual corporation. As Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and reclusive, a young acolyte named David Miscavige assumed control. After Hubbard's death in 1986, Miscavige quickly purged the ranks and began to transform the church once again. Miscavige has overseen some of the church's greatest triumphs -- among them a controversial billion-dollar IRS tax exemption and Tom Cruise's emergence as a vocal advocate -- but he has also created a climate of fear and intimidation, according to ex-members whose stories of abuse Reitman shares. Reitman is the first to examine Miscavige's twenty-five year reign and what it might mean for the future of the church. - Publisher.

Ranging from the world of Medieval women mystics to the writings of Jonathan Edwards, from the Tantric practices of Indian sadhus to the emergence of New-Age Western spirituality, this study challenges the tendency of post-Kantian modernity to identify ""spirituality"" with an intellectual flight from sensuality and attempts instead to retrieve a more integrated and holistic approach.

Until recently, the Haitian practice of Vodou was often identified with devil worship, dark curses, and superstition. Some saw the saint images and the Catholic influences and wrote Vodou off as a ""Christian aberration."" Others were appalled by the animal sacrifices and the fact that the houngans and mambos charge money for their services. Those who sought Vodou because they believed it could harness ""evil"" forces were disappointed when their efforts to gain fame, fortune, or endless romance failed and so abandoned their ""voodoo fetishes."" Those who managed to get the attention of the lwa, often received cosmic retaliation for treating the lwa as attack dogs or genies, which only further cemented Vodou's stereotype as ""dangerous.""Kenaz Filan, an initiate of the Societe la Belle Venus, offers extensive background information on the featured lwa, including their mythology and ancestral lineage, as well as specific instructions on how to honor and interact fruitfully with those that make themselves accessible. This advice will be especially useful for the solitary practitioner who doesn't have the personal guidance of a societe available. Filan emphasizes the importance of having a quickened mind that can read the lwa's desires intuitively in order to avoid establishing dogma-based relationships. This working guide to successful interaction with the full Vodou pantheon also presents the role of Vodou in Haitian culture and explores the symbiotic relationship Vodou has maintained with Catholicism.KENAZ FILAN (Houngan Coquille du Mer) was initiated into Societe la Belle Venus in New York City in 2003 after ten years of solitary service to the lwa. Filan's articles on Vodou have appeared in newWitch, PanGaia, and Planet magazines and in the pagan community newspaper Widdershins.

It is an undertaking to be all the more useful, as the ordinary Englishman is not a philosopher; with him, as with Dr. Johnson's friend, ""cheerfulness will keep breaking in."" This book, though written by a deeply read student of philosophy, will be found intelligible, and even agreeably readable. Its message is one of hope, or rather of confidence and conviction, and it is expressed in such a spirit that must leave the reader with a very friendly feeling towards the author.

These fields often seem at odds, butting metaphysical heads. Instead of talking at, how about talking with one another? This book engages three academic disciplines--distinct yet sharing much in common--in a slice of conversation and community in which participants have aimed at validating the other and the way the other sees the world. The result is a collection of essays united by a thread that can be hard to find in academia. In bringing together a wide range of contributors on a project that at first seemed unlikely, Irreconcilable Differences? is also a testament to the spirit of cooperation and hard work--evidence that small acts and events can make a big difference, and that sometimes all you need in order to make something good happen is an idea with a little support along the way. The editors of this collection are hopeful that its contributors and readers will keep looking for ways to bridge academic, social, and political gaps. We need to forge relationships based on personal knowledge and proper confidence seeking to make meaningful claims in an increasingly complex world.

Skepticism in classical Islam,Paul L.

It examines the way key thinkers in classical Islam faced perplexing questions about the nature of God and his relation to the world, all the while walking a fine line between belief in God's message as revealed in the Qur'an, and the power of the mind to discover truths on its own. Skepticism in Classical Islam reveals how doubt was actually an integral part of scholarly life at this time. Skepticism is by no means synonymous with atheism. It is, rather, the admission that one cannot convincingly demonstrate a truth claim with certainty, and Islam's scholars, like their counterparts elsewhere, acknowledged such impasses, only to be inspired to find new ways to resolve the conundrums they faced. Whilst their conundrums were unique, their admission of the limits of knowledge shares much with other scholarly traditions. Seeking to put Islam on the map of the broader study of the history of scepticism, this book will be of interest to scholars and students of Religion, History and Philosophy.

Calvinists and Catholics during Holland's golden age,Christine Kooi,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16532353W?edition=ia%3Acalvinistscathol0000kooi,/authors/OL2462491A/Christine_Kooi,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25223933M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""This book examines the social, political and religious relationships between Calvinists and Catholics during Holland's Golden Age. Although Holland, the largest province of the Dutch Republic, was officially Calvinist, its population was one of the most religiously heterogeneous in early modern Europe. The Catholic Church was officially disestablished in the 1570s, yet by the 1620s Catholicism underwent a revival, flourishing in a semi-clandestine private sphere. The book focuses on how Reformed Protestants dealt with this revived Catholicism, arguing that confessional coexistence between Calvinists and Catholics operated within a number of contiguous and overlapping social, political and cultural spaces. The result was a paradox: a society that was at once Calvinist and pluralist. Christine Kooi maps the daily interactions between people of different faiths and examines how religious boundaries were negotiated during an era of tumultuous religious change""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""It begins with an account of the preaching campaign in the south of France against the Cathar and Waldensian heresies organised by Pope Innocent III during the years 1203-1208, going on to provide a vivid and detailed narrative of the crusade launched in 1208-9 against heretics and those seen as their protectors. It ends shortly after an account of the death in 1218 of Simon de Montfort, until then leader of the crusade. The author's uncle, Guy, abbot at les Vaux-de-Cernay, took part in the preaching mission, and later played an important part in the crusade before becoming bishop of Carcassonne; Peter accompanied his uncle to the south on several occasions, so meeting many of those involved in the crusade. The Historia thus contains a wealth of first-hand detail about the personalities and events of the crusade, and contemporary warfare in general.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By turns a teacher, traitor, kingmaker, and visionary, Gerbert is the first Christian known to teach math using the nine Arabic numerals and zero.In The Abacus and the Cross, Nancy Marie Brown skillfully explores the new learning Gerbert brought to Europe.

The Composition of the Qur'an provides a systematic presentation of the writing processes (or rhetoric) and argues that there is indeed a coherence to the Qur'anic text. Michel Cuypers shows that the ancient Semitic texts, of which the Qur'an is a part, do not obey the Greek rhetoric and that their basic principle is therefore not progressive linearity, but symmetry which can take several forms, following precise rules. He argues that the knowledge of this rhetorical code allows for a radically new analysis of the structure and rhetoric of the Qur'an. Using copious amounts of examples from the text, The Composition of the Qur'an provides a new theoretical synthesis of Qur'anic rhetoric as well as a methodology for their application in further exegesis. A landmark publication in the field of Qur'anic Studies, this volume will be of interest to scholars and researchers in Islamic Studies, Religious Studies and Arabic Studies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet modern life in America can make those customs seem undesirable, even impractical. As a result, many congregations refashion church traditions so they may remain powerful and salient. How do these transformations occur? How do clergy and worshipers negotiate which aspects should be preserved or discarded?Focusing on the innovations of several mainline Protestant churches in the San Francisco Bay Area, Stephen Ellingson’s The Megachurch and the Mainline provides new understandings of the transformation of spiritual traditions. For Ellingson, these particular congregations typify a new type of Lutheranism—one which combines the evangelical approaches that are embodied in the growing legion of megachurches with American society’s emphasis on pragmatism and consumerism. Here Ellingson provides vivid descriptions of congregations as they sacrifice hymns in favor of rock music and scrap traditional white robes and stoles for Hawaiian shirts, while also making readers aware of the long history of similar attempts to Americanize the Lutheran tradition.This is an important examination of a religion in flux—one that speaks to the growing popularity of evangelicalism in America.

Indeed, representatives of both sides have regularly insisted on the fundamental incompatibility of anarchist and religious ideas and practices. Yet, ever since the emergence of anarchism as an intellectual and political movement, a considerable number of religious anarchists have insisted that their religious tradition necessarily implies an anarchist political stance. Their stories are finally gaining increasing public and scholarly attention.  Reflecting both a rise of interest in anarchist ideas and activism on the one hand, and the revival of religious ideas and movements in the political sphere on the other, this book examines a range of examples of overlaps and contestations between the two from a diverse range of academic perspectives.  The first pioneering volume of Essays in Anarchism & Religion comprises eight essays from leading international scholars on topics ranging from the anarchism of the historical Jesus to Zen Buddhism and the philosophies of Max Stirner and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.  In a world where political ideas increasingly matter once more, and religion is an increasingly visible aspect of global political life, these essays offer scholarly analysis of overlooked activists, ideas and movements, and as such reveal the possibility of a powerful critique of contemporary global society.

Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religous Traditions (The Library of Perennial Philosophy),Harry Oldmeadow,religion,First published in 2004,/works/OL224167W,/authors/OL2486442A/Harry_Oldmeadow,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8442025M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 25, 2004|Publisher  World Wisdom|Language English|Pages 505","“The West’s modern encounter with the East, particularly in the religious domain, was one of the most momentous events of our time…[yet] despite the many distinguished studies in the field, there [is] a certain gap which might usefully be filled.” With these words, the author of Journeys East, Harry Oldmeadow, begins to fill that gap.  If we accept, as the author does, “that Eastern religious traditions, even today and despite the ravages of modernization, are custodians of a wisdom of which the West stands in the most urgent need,” then this book traces for us how and when that wisdom has had an impact on modern Western thought and spirituality in a stunning variety of ways. In short, Journeys East presents readers with a sweeping view of events and people that have contributed and are still contributing much to the assimilation of Eastern ideas into modern Western thought. Oldmeadow moves quickly through the history of Western engagements with Eastern traditions, looks at Eastern influences on Western thought, and concludes with some observations on cross-cultural religious understanding and the inner unity of religions. The two concluding chapters offer important keys that can not only help us to recognize the spirit of the East in current Western ideas, but also to unlock its expansive and timeless secrets within our own intellectual and spiritual lives.Professor Harry Oldmeadow is currently the Coordinator of Philosophy and Religious Studies at La Trobe University in Bendigo, Australia. Over the last decade he has published extensively in such journals as Sacred Web, Sophia, and Asian Philosophy.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Don Richardson, author of the best-selling book Peace Child, has studied cultures throughout the world and found within hundreds of them startling evidence of belief in the one true God. In Eternity in Their Hearts, Richardson gives fascinating, real-life examples of ways people have exhibited in their histories terms and concepts that have prepared them for the gospel. Read how Pachacuti, the Inca king who founded Machu Picchu, the majestic fortress in Peru, accomplished something far more significant than merely building fortresses, temples or monuments. He sought, reached out and found a God far greater than anypopulargod of his own culture. And there have been others throughout the world, like him, who lived to receive the blessing of the gospel. Get ready to be amazed at these intriguing examples of how God uses redemptive analogies to bring all men to Himself, bearing out the truth from Ecclesiastes that God has also set eternity in the hearts of men. - Publisher.

"Proudhon et Dieu: Le combat d’un anarchiste; suivi de Pascal, Proudhon, Péguy",Bernard Voyenne,religion,First published in 2004,/works/OL5183054W,/authors/OL1154964A/Bernard_Voyenne,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL19264787M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Editions du Cerf|Language French|Pages 168,"Proudhon et Dieu : cette confrontation étonnera, et peut-être détonnera, auprès de ceux qui ne connaissent guère du plus méconnu des grands socialistes du XIXe siècle que sa célèbre apostrophe : « La propriété, c'est le vol. » En revanche, on cite peu la formule non moins paradoxale qui lui fait pendant : « Dieu, c'est le mal. » Il existe pourtant entre l'une et l'autre un lien étroit, qui est la volonté de purger du poison absolutiste l'ensemble des relations humaines. Issu d'une famille dont la pauvreté a laissé peu de place à la dévotion, le jeune Pierre Joseph Proudhon fut un catholique semblable à la plupart de ses contemporains jusqu'à sa quinzième année. S'il « perdit » alors la foi, scandalisé par l'indifférence de la hiérarchie catholique à la condition des pauvres, il n'abandonna pas pour autant toute inquiétude religieuse. Au contraire, on le voit, influencé par le courant traditionaliste et, sous l'emprise de la jeune fille qui paraît avoir été son unique amour, s'imaginer l'apologiste d'un christianisme qui, dégagé des compromissions politiques, se ferait hardiment réformateur de l'ordre social. Mais cela ne concerne encore que l'extérieur. L'autre côté des choses est que, même après s'être proclamé avec véhémence le négateur d'un Être suprême qui limiterait la liberté de sa création, il n'a jamais cessé de s'interroger sur l'existence de ce Dieu, sa nature et surtout son rôle dans le concert de l'histoire. Celui qui, précédant un Nietzsche et par certains aspects l'annoncant, s'était proclamé le contempteur de Dieu en a aussi rêvé la présence derrière une porte semblant sur le point de s'entrouvrir. Il lui est alors arrivé de s'écrier : « Qui est là ? », dans une angoisse peut-être proche de l'espérance.  Proudhon and God: this confrontation will astonish, maybe even shock, those whose only knowledge of the least-known of the great 19th century socialists is his famous remark ‘Property is theft’. Strangely enough, his other famous paradoxical quip, ‘God is evil’ is less often quoted. Yet the two quotations are closely linked, by the desire to purge human relations of absolutist poison. Such is the aim of this book in which the author presents the metaphysical background of Proudhon’s work. Born into a family whose poverty left little room for devotion, the young Pierre Joseph Proudhon was a Catholic, like most of his contemporaries, until the age of fifteen. If he then ‘lost faith’, scandalised by the indifference of the Catholic hierarchy to the living conditions of the poor, he did not give up all interest in religion. On the contrary, we see him submit to the influence of a traditionalist current, and that of a young woman, who seems to have been his only love, imagining himself as an apologist of a Christianity purged of its political compromises; a robust reformer of the social order. But that’s only the superficial appearance. On the inside, we can observe that even after vehemently proclaiming the negation of any Supreme Being that would limit the liberty of his creation, Proudhon never ceased to ask himself questions about the existence of God, His nature and especially His role in the great concert of history. He who, in advance of Nietzsche and in many ways heralding him, proclaimed himself to be the denigrator of God, also dreamed of God’s presence behind a door that seemed to be slightly ajar… At that moment, he cried out, ‘Who’s there?’ with anguish that was perhaps mingled with hope.

Part one deals with the origins of Abyssinia, mythical and historical, its evangelization, and its contacts within the Roman Empire. Part two covers the dark age when Abyssinia was cut off from the rest of Christendom by the rise of Islam. Part three describes the discovery of ""the kingdom of Prester John"" by the Portuguese early in the 16th century, and the attempt of the Jesuits to convert the country to the Catholic faith. Part four covers the second period of isolation which followed the expulsion of the Jesuits down to the collapse of the monarchy at the end of the 18th century. These four parts are contributed by Mr. A. H. M. Jones. In part five Miss Elizabeth Monroe describes the resurrection of the kingdom in the 19th century and its relations with the European powers which occupied the neighboring lands and endeavored to establish themselves in Abyssinia itself. The dispute with Italy, which, whatever its outcome, clearly marks the opening of a new chapter in Abyssinian history, is separately treated by Miss Monroe in part six. - Preface.

Understanding world religions,Irving Hexham,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL15507143W?edition=ia%3Aunderstandingwor0000hexh,/authors/OL545193A/Irving_Hexham,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24468052M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Zondervan|Language English|Pages 512,"Irving Hexham's introductory world religions text explores various religions under the broad categories of African Religions, the Yogic Traditions (including Buddhism), and the Abrahamic traditions. He presents an appreciative yet realistic approach, noting both the strengths and inherent problems of various world religions. Globalization and high-speed communication put twenty-first century people in contact with adherents to a wide variety of world religions, but usually, valuable knowledge of these other traditions is limited at best. On the one hand, religious stereotypes abound, hampering a serious exploration of unfamiliar philosophies and practices. On the other hand, the popular idea that all religions lead to the same God or the same moral life fails to account for the distinctive origins and radically different teachings found across the world's many religions. Understanding World Religions presents religion as a complex and intriguing matrix of history, philosophy, culture, beliefs, and practices. Hexham believes that a certain degree of objectivity and critique is inherent in the study of religion, and he guides readers in responsible ways of carrying this out. Of particular importance is Hexham's decision to explore African religions, which have frequently been absent from major religion texts. He surveys these in addition to varieties of Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",19 Want to read|2 Currently reading|0 Have read

Open secrets,Richard Lischer,religion,First published in 2001,/works/OL3501413W?edition=ia%3Aopensecretsspiri00rich,/authors/OL585040A/Richard_Lischer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL6793457M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2001|Publisher  Doubleday|Language English|Pages 243,"Open Secrets is Richard Lischer's story of his early career as a Lutheran minister.  Fresh out of divinity school and full of enthusiasm, Lischer found himself assigned to a small conservative church in an economically depressed town in southern Illinois.  This was far from what this overly enthusiastic and optimistic young man expected.  The town was bleak, poor, and clearly not a step on his path to a brilliant career.It's an awkward marriage at best, a young man with a Ph.D. in theology, full of ideas and ambitions, determined to improve his parish and bring them into the twenty-first century, and a community that is ""as tightly sealed as a jar of home-canned pickles."" In their own way, they welcome him and his family, even though they think he's ""got bigger fish to fry."" Thus begins Richard Lischer's first year as a pastor: bringing communion to the sick (but forgetting to bring the wafers); marrying two unlikely couples--a pregnant teenager and her boyfriend, and two people who can't stop fighting.Often he doesn't understand his congregation, and sometimes they don't understand him; for instance, why does his wife hire a baby-sitter and instead of leaving, put on her bathing suit, grab a stack of novels, and hide from the kids?  Or why can't Pastor Lischer see how important it is for a woman with little money to buy an elaborate coffin to bury her husband in? There are also the moments of grace, when pastor and parishioner unite for a common goal: when he asks for prayers for his infant son, and can feel everyone in the congregation ministering to him; when old hurts are put aside to help a desperate young woman finish college and raise her baby; or when he helps save a woman from dying of a drug overdose.In Open Secrets Lischer tells not only his own story but also the story of New Cana and all of its inhabitants--lovable, deeply flawed, imperfect people that stick together.  With his sharp eye and keen wit, Lischer perfectly captures the comedy of small town life with all of its feuds, rumors, scandals, and friendships.  In the end he learns to appreciate not only the life New Cana has to offer, but also the people who have accepted him, at last, as part of themselves.From the Hardcover edition.

Radical protestantism in Spinoza's thought,Graeme Hunter,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL5708049W,/authors/OL1388678A/Graeme_Hunter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Spinoza is praised as a father of atheism, a precursor of the Enlightenment, an 'anti-theologian' and a father of political liberalism. Â When the religious dimension of Spinoza's thought cannot be ignored, it is usually dismissed as some form of mysticism or pantheism. This book explores the positive references to Christianity presented throughout Spinoza's works, focusing particularly on the Tractatus Theologico-politicus. Â Arguing that advocates of the anti-Christian or un-Christian Spinoza fail to look beyond Spinoza's ethics, which has the least to say about Christianity, Graeme Hunter offers a fresh interpretation of Spinoza's most important works and his philosophical and religious thought. Â Â While there isÂ no evidence that SpinozaÂ became a Christian in any formal sense, Â Hunter argues thatÂ his aim was neither to be heretical nor atheistic, but rather to effect a radical reform of Christianity and a return to simple Biblical practices. Â This book presents a unique contribution to current debate for students and specialist scholars in philosophy of religion, the history of philosophy and early modern history.""--Provided by publisher.

Yet until now little attention has been paid to the role Reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal -- and, not coincidentally, atheistic -- Soviet empire.In this groundbreaking book, political historian Paul Kengor draws upon Reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose Christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. Raised in the Disciples of Christ Church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, Reagan embraced the church after reading a Christian novel at the age of eleven. A devoted Sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of ""practical Christianity"" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life.But it was in his lifelong battle against communism -- first in Hollywood, then on the political stage -- that Reagan's Christian beliefs had their most profound effect. Appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of Bolshevik Marxism, Reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the USSR. Inspired by influences as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. ""The source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual,"" he said in his Evil Empire address. ""And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man.""From a church classroom in 1920s Dixon, Illinois, to his triumphant mission to Moscow in 1988, Ronald Reagan was both political leader and spiritual crusader. God and Ronald Reagan deepens immeasurably our understanding of how these twin missions shaped his presidency -- and changed the world.

Turville-Petre  Much like Ellis Davidson’s Gods and Myths of Northern Europe, legendary Oxford Old Norse professor E.O.G. Turville-Petre’s Myth and Religion of the North provides a comprehensive overview of the pre-Christian religion of Scandinavia. However, while somewhat more academic than Ellis Davidson’s book (which is why I listed Gods and Myths of Northern Europe as #4 and Myth and Religion of the North as #5), Turville-Petre more than makes up for this with his sheer comprehensiveness and acuity of insight. Where Ellis Davidson is highly admirable, Turville-Petre is downright astonishing.  In numerous universities across the world today, Myth and Religion of the North is treated as the go-to reference book for all things related to Norse mythology, and with good reason. Reading this book is something like an intellectual initiation. To put it simply: until you’ve read this absolutely essential book, you’re just a dabbler in Norse mythology.

This study examines how British politics operated in practice during the age of Mary, Queen of Scots, and explains how the crises of the mid-sixteenth century moulded the future political shape of the British Isles. A central figure in these struggles was the fifth earl of Argyll, the most powerful magnate not only at the court of Queen Mary, his sister-in-law, but throughout the three kingdoms. His domination of the Western Highlands and Islands drew him into the complex politics of the north of Ireland, while his Protestant commitment involved him in Anglo-Scottish relations. His actions also helped determine the Protestant allegiance of the British mainland and the political and religious complexion of Ireland. Argyll's career therefore demonstrates both the possibilities and the limitations of British history throughout the early modern period.

Borg.Renowned biblical scholar Marcus J. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings on Jesus can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. Only this e-book edition of Meeting Jesus Again contains Borg's musings on Easter and its place in history and faith.Of the many recent books on the historical Jesus, none has explored what the latest biblical scholarship means for personal faith. Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining.""Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,"" Borg writes. ""Rather, it means to give one's heart, one's self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord.""Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life--one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community.In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus' character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith.For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus' life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: ""For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus--the living one who comes to us even now--will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.""   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

The belief that meaning is fashioned from some mixture of family, friends, a stable career, and financial security permeates American culture. Profane Parables examines three films that assault this venerated American myth. Fight Club (1999), American Beauty (1999), and About Schmidt (2002) indict the American Dream as a meaningless enterprise that is existentially, ethically, and aesthetically bankrupt. In their blistering critique of the hallowed wisdom of the American Dream, these films function like Jesus' parables. As narratives of disorientation, Jesus' parables upend conventional and cherished worldviews. Author Matthew Rindge illustrates the religious function of these films as parables of subversion that provoke rather than comfort and disturb rather than stabilize. Ultimately, Rindge considers how these parabolic films operate as sacred texts in their own right. (Publisher).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It takes the form of direct dialogues between a modern researcher and a member of the Qumran Essene community. Alive around the time of Christ, this community has become the focus of ideas about the connection of Jesus' teachings to earlier traditions. This book gives a full description of the nature and purpose of the community, and the birth and upbringing of Jesus and John the Baptist. Also, it gives Essene renderings of Key Old Testament stories, concerning Moses, Ezekiel, Daniel and others, plus startling insights into ancient history.

This is the question that lies at the heart of the momentous conflict between Galileo Galilei and the Roman Catholic Church. In his provocative reexamination of one of the turning points in the history of science and thought, Wade Rowland demonstrates that Galileo's mistake was to insist that science -- and only science -- provides the truth about reality. In asserting the primacy of science in the territory of truth, Galileo strayed from purely scientific inquiry into the theological realm, an act that put him squarely on the warpath with the Church.

But their sexual and spiritual excesses soon forced them to go underground and follow a dark and dangerous path. Their charismatic leader, David ""Moses"" Berg, preached a radical critique of the piety and hypocrisy of mainstream Christianity. But Berg's message quickly devolved into its own web of lies. He lusted for power and unlimited access to female members of his flock—including young girls and teenagers—and became a drunken tyrant, setting up re-indoctrination camps around the world for rebellious teenagers under his control.Thousands of children raised in The Family would defect and try to live normal lives, but the prophet's heir apparent, Ricky ""Davidito"" Rodriguez, was unable to either bear the excesses of the cult or fit into normal society. Sexually and emotionally abused as a child, Ricky left the fold and began a crusade to destroy the only family he ever knew, including a plot to kill his own mother.Veteran journalist Don Lattin has written a powerful, engrossing book about this uniquely American tragedy. Jesus Freaks is a cautionary tale for those who fail to question the prophesies and proclamations of anyone who claims to speak for God.

According to the Jewish mystics, a holy person is someone who has not lost the holiness that every baby is born with. A holy person is someone who fulfills it. Stories about Jewish holy women have rarely been collected in such an engaging and entertaining form. The tales display a specifically female Jewish spirituality, giving us a peek into a world of devotional beauty that focuses on kindness. These stories of laughter and tears, humility and bravery, striving and trance, have an appeal spanning the denominational spectrum: they are spiritual nourishment for the soul. The rabbis say there are both male and female angels and angels are on earth as well as in heaven. These tales enhance our appreciation of the female angels on earth.

Who's Normal?  Not you, that's for sure! No one you've ever met, either. None of us are normal according to God's definition, and the closer we get to each other, the plainer that becomes.  Yet for all our quirks, sins, and jagged edges, we need each other. Community is more than just a word---it is one of our most fundamental requirements. So how do flawed, abnormal people such as ourselves master the forces that can drive us apart and come together in the life-changing relationships God designed us for?  In Everybody's Normal Till You Get to Know Them, teacher and best-selling author John Ortberg zooms in on the things that make community tick. You'll get a thought-provoking look at God's heart, at others, and at yourself. Even better, you'll gain wisdom and tools for drawing closer to others in powerful, impactful ways. With humor, insight, and a gift for storytelling, Ortberg shows how community pays tremendous dividends in happiness, health, support, and growth. It's where all of us weird, unwieldy people encounter God's love in tangible ways and discover the transforming power of being loved, accepted, and valued just the way we are.  The need for community is woven into the very fabric of our being. Nothing else can substitute for the life-giving benefits of connecting with others---not even God. He won't preempt the way he himself has designed us to reflect his own intensely relational nature.  But there's a hitch in our experience of community, says John Ortberg: We're all weird. Folks around us may seem normal enough, but just wait till we get to know them---and they get to know us. The unhealthy, sinful ways we respond to life in a fallen world are hardly God's idea of 'normal,' and they can make us as unhuggable as porcupines. We face the 'porcupine dilemma,' says Ortberg: We need each other, but how do we get close without getting hurt? How do we get past all those quills and grow together in Christ?  In Everybody's Normal Till You Get to Know Them, Ortberg once again reveals his gift for sharing profound insights using a lighten-up approach. With winsome humor and a fondness for well-spun stories, he pops the myth of normalcy and hands us the keys to creating and sustaining relationships. 'God's dream for community encompasses the redemption of all spheres of life,' he says.  Who doesn't want like to be liked, to be wanted, to have solid, satisfying friendships! Ortberg shows what such relationships are made of. He reveals the benefits of authenticity---what it means to live with an 'unveiled face,' as the Bible puts it. He encourages us to trade the stones it's so easy to cast at others for acceptance. He opens our eyes and heart to empathy, the art of reading people. And he takes us through the ins and outs of conflict, forgiveness, confrontation, inclusion, and gratitude.  The principles and discussion questions in this book are down-to-earth. They're for real people living in a real world, and are intended to help us count the practical cost of relationship and then pay it---because in all the rewards and struggles of community, we're investing in something beyond our comprehension. You could call it heaven. You could call it home. It's the place where all of us are headed, all of us belong, and all of us will be normal at last.

On the Significance of Religion in Conflict and Conflict Resolution,Christine Schliesser,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL20754702W,/authors/OL6183542A/Christine_Schliesser,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Pages 166,"""  In this ground-breaking volume, the authors analyze the role of religion in conflict and conflict resolution. They do so from the perspectives of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, while bringing different disciplines into play, including peace and conflict studies, religious studies, theology and ethics. With much of current academic, political and public attention focusing on the conflictive dimensions of religion, this book also explores the constructive resources of religion for conflict resolution and reconciliation.  Analyzing the specific contributions of religious actors in this field, their potentials and possible problems connected with them, this book sheds light on the concrete contours of the oftentimes vague “religious factor” in processes of social change. Case studies in current and former settings of violent conflict such as Israel, post-genocide Rwanda and Pakistan provide “real life” contexts for discussion. Combining cutting-edge research with case studies and concrete implications for academics, policy makers and practitioners, this concise and easily accessible volume helps to build bridges between these oftentimes separated spheres of engagement.""

Offering a broad comparative view, Malcolm Hamilton draws on the insights of history, anthropology and sociology, surveying classic and contemporary theory to give a full picture of the variety and scope and how they relate to particular beliefs and practices. Inclusion of current debates and research findings bring this edition fully up to date in every respect. The chapters on secularisation and religious sects and movements have, in particular, been extended to incorporate recent work and developments. Both include fuller consideration of the contributions of rational choice theorists and their critics on questions such as the relationship between religious pluralism and conditions prevailing in the religious 'market place'. The chapter on sects and movements, which includes a new section on conversion, provides an extended discussion of earlier work on the nature of sectarianism as well as new insights that studies of a diverse range of religious and related movements have generated.

Few considered the rise of theocracy in a modernized state possible, and fewer thought it might result from a popular revolution.  Said Amir Arjomand's The Turban for the Crown provides a thoughtful, painstakingly researched,and intelligible account of the turmoil in Iran which reveals the importance of this singular event for our understanding of revolutions.      Providing crucial historical background, Arjomand examines both the structure of authority in Shi'ism (one of the two main branches of Islam) and the impact of the modern state on Iranian society, two factors essential to the comprehension of the revolution of 1979...

This bold new book explores how Christianity began by tracing its earliest texts, including the secret Gospel of Thomas, rediscovered in Egypt in 1945.When her infant son was diagnosed with fatal pulmonary hypertension, Elaine Pagels's spiritual and intellectual quest took on a new urgency, leading her to explore historical and archeological sources and to investigate what Jesus and his teachings meant to his followers before the invention of doctrine--and before the invention of Christianity as we know it. The astonishing discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, along with more than fifty other early Christian texts unknown since antiquity, offers startling clues. Pagels compares such sources as Thomas's gospel (which claims to give Jesus' secret teaching, and finds its closest affinities with kabbalah) with the canonic texts to show how Christian leaders chose to include some gospels and exclude others from the collection we have come to know as the New Testament. To stabilize the emerging Christian church in times of devastating persecution, the church fathers constructed the canon, creed, and hierarchy--and, in the process, suppressed many of its spiritual resources. Drawing on new scholarship--her own, and that of an international group of scholars--that has come to light since the publication in 1979 of The Gnostic Gospels, Pagels shows that what matters about Christianity involves much more than any one set of beliefs. Traditions embodied in Judaism and Christianity can powerfully affect us in heart, mind, and spirit, inspire visions of a new society based on practicing justice and love, even heal and transform us.Provocative, beautifully written, and moving, Beyond Belief, the most personal of Pagels's books to date, shows how ""the impulse to seek God overflows the narrow banks of a single tradition."" Pagels writes, ""What I have come to love in the wealth and diversity of our religious traditions--and the communities that sustain them--is that they offer the testimony of innumerable people to spiritual discovery, encouraging us, in Jesus' words, to 'seek, and you shall find.'""

With his trademark blend of wit and scholarship, Kirsch traces the war of God against the gods from its roots in Ancient Egypt to its climax during the last stand of paganism the tumultuous fourth century, when two passionate, charismatic, and revolutionary Roman emperors, the Christian Constantine and the pagan Julian, changed the course of history and shaped the world we live in today.

Cass|Language English|Pages 743,"Mary Henrietta Kingsley was an English ethnographic and scientific writer and explorer whose travels throughout West Africa and resulting work helped shape European perceptions of African cultures and British imperialism. After a preliminary visit to the Canary Islands, Kingsley decided to travel to the west coast of Africa. The only non-African women who regularly embarked on (often dangerous) journeys to Africa were usually the wives of missionaries, government officials, or explorers. Exploration and adventure were not seen as fitting roles for women in the Victorian era. Yet, when Mary Kingsley's invalid parents died within six weeks of each other, she followed in her explorer father's footsteps and traveled to Africa against her society's every convention. Here is her lively and witty account of that journey, an immediate bestseller when it first came out in 1897 and every bit as gripping today.

David Norton traces the work of Tyndale and his successors, analysing the translation and revisions of two representative passages. His fascinating new account follows in detail the creation of the KJB, including attention to the translators' manuscript work. He also examines previously unknown evidence such as the diary of John Bois, the only man who made notes on the translation. At the centre of the book is a thorough discussion of the first edition. The latter part of the book traces the printing and textual history of the KJB and provides a concise account of its changing scholarly and literary reputations""--  ""The most important book in English religion and culture, the King James Bible, began to be created at some unknown moment nearer three than two thousand years before 1604, the year in which James I, once king of Scotland, now also king of England, assembled the religious leaders of the land at Hampton Court and, seemingly by chance, ordered the making of a new translation of the Bible. That unknown original moment of creation came when the descendants of Abraham moved beyond telling to writing down their beliefs and the stories of their heritage. It was a crucial moment in civilisation. The ancient Hebrews began to be the people of the written word. Their writings became the collection of books we know as the Old Testament. It enshrined their knowledge of themselves and of their relationship to their God. Without it they might not have survived as a people, and without it the Christian world -- perhaps also the Islamic world -- would have been something unimaginably different from what it is. The word of God was all in all to the religious Jews. In the beginning God talked with Adam and Eve as a lord to his tenants, person to person, then to Moses 'face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend' (Exod. 33:11). The intimacy might have declined and, by the timeofthe young Samuel, the wordofthe Lord had become 'precious' (1 Sam. 3:1), that is, both rare and valuable. God still spoke through his prophets, and they could say, 'thus saith the Lord'. But for ordinary people he spoke most surely in the words of the book. These words came to be guarded as the greatest treasure, for God and the word were the same thing: 'the Word was God' (John 1:1)""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But history also records other information about Judas Iscariot. One such reference was written in 180 by an influential Church Father named St. Irenaeus who railed against the Gospel of Judas for depicting the last days of Jesus from the perspective of the disgraced apostle. In its pages, Judas is Christ’s favorite. It’s a startlingly different story than the one handed down through the ages. Once it was denounced as heresy, the Gospel of Judas faded from sight. It became one of history’s forgotten manuscripts. Until now.In this compelling and exhaustively researched account, Herbert Krosney unravels how the Gospel of Judas was found and its meaning painstakingly teased from the ancient Coptic script that had hid its message for centuries. With all the skills of an investigative journalist and master storyteller, Krosney traces the forgotten gospel’s improbable journey across three continents, a trek that would take it through the netherworld of the international antiquities trade, until the crumbling papyrus is finally made to give up its secrets. The race to discover the Gospel of Judas will go down as one of the great detective stories of biblical archaeology.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In distinguishing religions from belief systems, Carseworks to reveal how belief—with its restriction on thoughtand encouragement of hostility—has corrupted religion andspawned violence the world over. Galileo, Martin Luther, Abraham Lincoln, andJesus Christ—using their stories Carse creates his own brand ofparable and establishes a new vocabulary with which to studyconflict in the modern world. The Religious Case Against Beliefintroduces three kinds of ignorance: ordinary ignorance (amundane lack of knowledge, such as ignorance of tomorrow’sweather or the reason why your stove is malfunctioning), willfulignorance (an intentional avoidance of accessible knowledge),and finally higher ignorance (a learned understanding that nomatter how many truths we may accumulate, our knowledgefalls infinitely short of the truth). While ordinary ignorance is common to all people,Carse associates the strongest manifestation of willful ignorancewith the most fervent (and dangerous) of believers. Hepoints to the historic conflict between Martin Luther and HolyRoman Emperor Charles V both to reveal this seemingly religiouscollision as a clash of belief and to identify belief ’s inherentlydestructive characteristics. From Luther to the contemporaryChristian right, we learn that believers construct identityby erecting boundaries and by fostering aggression between thebeliever and the other. This is why belief systems choose—atgreat cost—to remain locked in bloody conflict rather than toengage in dialogue, recognizing the great deal they have in common. This is willful ignorance. In fierce contrast to willful ignorance, higher ignoranceis an acquired state enhanced by religion. Those travelingthe path to higher ignorance recognize faith teachings (suchas the Bible) as poetry intended to promote contemplation,interpretation, and a sense of wonder. For evidence of religion’sdeeply embedded rejection of singular truth and its acceptanceof diverse dialogue, Carse looks to the many faces of Jesus presentedin the books of the Bible and elsewhere. Uncontaminatedby belief systems, religion rejects the imagined boundaries thatfalsely divide people and ideas, working to expand horizons. The Religious Case Against Belief exposes a world inwhich religion and belief have become erroneously (and terrifyingly)conflated. In strengthening their association with powerfulbelief systems, religions have departed from their essentialpurpose as agencies of higher ignorance. Carse uses his widerangingunderstanding of religion to find a viable and vitalpath away from what he calls the Age of Faith II and towardopen-ended global dialogue. Far from abstract philosophicalmusing, The Religious Case Against Belief is required reading forour age.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

When you make the sacrifice in marriage, you're sacrificing not to each other but to unity in a relationship"") to virgin births, from savior figures to heroic figures such as Luke Skywalker from Star Wars (""...By overcoming the dark passions, the hero symbolizes our ability to control the irrational savages within us."")  The Power of Myth is a great summing up of Joseph Campbell's work, sure to stand alongside his two celebrated classics The Hero With a Thousand Faces and The Masks of God and his recent The Atlas of World Mythology.

To begin, major contemporary theorists rethink the place of religion in the public sphere from republican, liberal and critical-theoretical viewpoints.

Relying on new research and improved translations, Davis uncovers some amazing questions and contradictions about what the Bible really says. Jericho's walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. Moses never parted the Red Sea. There was a Jesus, but he wasn't born on Christmas and he probably wasn't an only child.Davis brings readers up-to-date on findings gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels that prompt serious scholars to ask such serious questions as: Who wrote the Bible? Did Jesus say everything we were taught he did? Did he say more? By examining the Bible historically, Davis entertains and amazes, provides a much better understanding of the subject, and offers much more fun learning about it.

Borg shows how we can live passionately as Christians in today's world by practicing the vital elements of Christian faith.For the millions of people who have turned away from many traditional beliefs about God, Jesus, and the Bible, but still long for a relevant, nourishing faith, Borg shows why the Christian life can remain a transforming relationship with God. Emphasizing the critical role of daily practice in living the Christian life, he explores  how prayer, worship, Sabbath, pilgrimage, and more can be experienced as authentically life-giving practices.Borg reclaims terms and ideas once thought  to be the sole province of evangelicals and fundamentalists: he shows that terms such  as ""born again"" have real meaning for all Christians; that the ""Kingdom of God"" is not a bulwark against secularism but is a means of transforming society into a world that values justice and love; and that the Christian life is essentially about opening one's heart to God and to others.

The calm authoritative voice of science and scholarship, explains that gay people are neither sick nor sinful. Author Stuart Edser threads his own extraordinary story throughout the text, using this and his experience as a clinician to guide his thinking. At the end, he presents an alternative model of Christian discourse to that which we usually hear and offers a positive voice so often glaringly absent from the Church's utterances on homosexuality. He argues passionately for church people everywhere to open their minds and show a willingness to discard older ways of thinking where more modern explanations elucidate the truth more closely.

This first history of British atheism, first published in 1987, tries to explain this reaction while exhibiting the development of atheism from Hobbes to Russell. Although avowed atheism appeared surprisingly late - 1782 in Britain - there were covert atheists in the middle seventeenth century. By tracing its development from so early a date, Dr Berman gives an account of an important and fascinating strand of intellectual history.

With time Judaism proved as problematical as Christianity for him.  Though unable to profess either faith, he recognized the value of religion.

Families gather for fancy feasts and presents are exchanged. But the true meaning of the holiday does not come wrapped in brightly colored paper and bows. The real gift of Christmas is the birth of Jesus; the celebration is honoring this miracle with those whom we love.In Follow the Star, Bishop T. D. Jakes shares the Christmas stories that touched his heart and shaped his life. He colorfully recounts childhood memories and deeply personal experiences that illuminate the significance of the season: family stories about the worst of times, when they found the spirit of Christmas despite poverty and hardship; stories about the best of times, and the need to slow down and appreciate the real gifts of fellowship, love-and God. Bishop Jakes also includes biblical stories that magnify the relevance of this blessed day, and with his unique insight, he lights the way to a deeper understanding of what Christmas is all about.Inspiring, heartwarming, and joyful, Follow the Star will be a treasured collection of wisdom and warmth this Christmas and for years to come.

The Panentheism of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause,Benedikt Paul Göcke,religion,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500703W,/authors/OL7724293A/Benedikt_Paul_Göcke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Lang GmbH, Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften, Peter|Language English","The book provides the first analysis of Karl Christian Friedrich Krause’s system of philosophy and his panentheism in English. Karl Christian Friedrich Krause has bequeathed to us a system of philosophy which is little recognised in contemporary philosophy. This is both surprising and unfortunate, because Krause’s philosophical system has much to offer: Through transcendental reflection on the nature of the human, Krause understands God as the one infinite and unconditioned reality, and the ultimate necessary condition of knowledge. God makes humanity, nature, and reason ultimately comprehensible as the essential categories of the divine Essence. God is thus the single, primary, object of science that is already logically presupposed even before His discovery. Science presupposes theology, and theology is best read as panentheism.

This symposium of specially commissioned essays draws together an international team of thirteen scholars and pastors to address the importance of textual preaching in the history and life of the early church, the historic church, and the contemporary church. Contributions include essays on Old Testament preaching, preaching in Hebrews, gender-sensitive preaching, preaching in the theology of Jonathan Edwards, Charles Spurgeon, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and in Eastern Orthodoxy. It also includes essays on a range of homiletical challenges that textual preaching raises for the contemporary preacher, including genre, preaching without notes, inhabiting the text, and preaching without platitudes. A final reflection by Dave Hansen on the state of textual preaching rounds out the collection. The preaching of the gospel stands at the heart of Christian praxis. These essays make a vital contribution to the recovery of the importance of preaching, focused on the text of Scripture. Written with an eye to the pastor and practitioner as well as those in the pews and in the classroom, this is a book that should appeal to a wide range of readers.

It focuses upon those religions that continue to demand the attention of the Western world. Following an introduction on the philosophy of religion, attention is focused on Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam which are religions that have had (and probably continue to have) the greatest number of followers in Western society. In addition to the lasting impact that religion has had in society, we are witnesses to the development of secularism on the one hand and the revival of religious sentiment on the other, thus chapters on modernity postmodernism, and 'fundamentalism' have also been included. The distinctive feature of the book is its modern feel. Each chapter brings the reader up-to-date with recent developments and commentaries upon recent religious thought, theology and religious-political movements. Moreover, the length of the chapters permits a detailed analysis which is so often lacking in books on world religions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This was the close of the Victorian age, and the beginning of the first great wave of scientific challenges to the religious beliefs of the Christian world. Religious thinkers were having to brace themselves. Some raced to show that science did not undermine religious belief. Others tried to reconcile science and faith, and even to show that the tools of science, facts and reason, could support knowledge of God. In the English speaking world, many had espoused such a project, but one figure stands out. Before his death in 1887, the Scottish judge Adam Gifford endowed the Gifford Lectures to keep this debate going, a science haunted debate on ""all questions about man's conception of God or the Infinite."" The list of Gifford lecturers is a veritable Who's Who of modern scientists, philosophers and theologians   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But today's business environment is complex. Those in business, and those preparing to enter the business world, need to grapple with the question of how integrity and biblical ethics can be applied in the workplace. They need to go ""beyond integrity"" in their thinking. Beyond Integrity is neither excessively theoretical nor simplistic and dogmatic. Rather, it offers a balanced and pragmatic approach to a number of concrete ethical issues. Readings from a wide range of sources present competing perspectives on each issue, and real-life case studies further help the reader grapple with ethical dilemmas. The authors conclude each chapter with their own distinctly Christian commentary on the topic covered. This second edition includes recent issues that have surfaced in today's constantly changing business culture. Revisions include: ethical implications of information technology, biotechnology, and other important new issues; reflections on recent court cases that shape the moral discussion; shorter text with increased accessibility to the reader. With the goal of helping readers arrive at their own conclusions, this book provides a decision-making model. Beyond Integrity equips men and women to develop a biblically based approach to the ethical challenges of 21st century business. - Back cover.

But how was the vast territory of the empire controlled? Did the demands of central government stimulate economic growth or endanger survival? What forces of cohesion operated to balance the social and economic inequalities and high mortality rates? How did the official religion react in the face of the diffusion of alien cults and the emergence of Christianity? These are some of the many questions posed here, in an expanded edition of the original, pathbreaking account of the society, economy and culture of the Roman empire. As an integrated study of the life and outlook of the life and outlook of the ordinary inhabitants of the Roman world, it deepens our understanding of the underlying factors in this important formative period of world history. Additions to the second edition include an introductory chapter which sets the scene and explores the consequences for government and the governing classes of the replacement of the Republic by the rule of emperors. A second extra chapter assesses how far Rome's subjects resisted her hegemony. Addenda to the chapters throughout offer up-to-date bibliography and discussion of the state of the question, and point to new evidence and approaches which have enlivened Roman history in recent decades""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although his seventy-hour workweek has already eaten into his limited family time, Nick can't pass up the opportunity to see what kind of plot his colleagues have hatched.The normally confident, cynical Nick soon finds himself thrown off-balance, drawn into an intriguing conversation with a baffling man who appears to be more than comfortable discussing everything from world religions to the existence of heaven and hell. And this man who calls himself Jesus also seems to know a disturbing amount about Nick's personal life...............""You're bored, Nick. You were made for more than this. You're worried about God stealing your fun, but you've got it backwards.... There's no adventure like being joined to the Creator of the universe.""  He leaned back off the table. ""And your first mission would be to let him guide you out of the mess you're in at work."".............As the evening progresses, their conversation touches on life, God, meaning, pain, faith, and doubt--and it seems that having Dinner with a Perfect Stranger may change Nick's life forever.From the Hardcover edition.

In this major book, Mark Lilla reveals the sources of this age-old quest-and its surprising role in shaping Western thought. Making us look deeper into our beliefs about religion, politics, and the fate of civilizations, Lilla reminds us of the modern West's unique trajectory and how to remain on it.

If at times it criticizes certain views on the grounds of their unreasonableness, it does so to prepare for a view which seems more reasonable. If at other times it shows that what is wrong with a certain philosophical outlook is an emphasis on a part against the whole, it does so in order to suggest a view that is more catholic in the sense of being the whole truth. There is little sympathy in these pages for those who believe that everything modern is good, or that everything modern is bad. The remarkable -- if unsettling -- discovery is that seventy-five years later, Bishop Sheen's challenge o tired old errors still finds some of them huffing and puffing under entirely new garb.

Joy is a divine attribute, and creating joy around us an essential part of faith. Every homily and speech in this book delivers, in warm, engaging language accessible to believers and nonbelievers alike, a key lesson, instructing readers on finding love and happiness in a chaotic world. Along the way, Pope Francis discusses the sanctity of women's rights, talks about how the love of sports can bring out our best qualities, and explains why fighting discrimination is the essence of loving thy neighbor. He shares personal stories and anecdotes from his life, provides comforting messages of hope, and discusses the ways flawed families can make you a better person. The core ideas of Francis's papacy--mercy, support for marginalized people, and diplomacy--shine through.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Perhaps the human fascination with the supernatural stems from the fact that most of us, at some point in our lives, have experienced something we couldn't quite explain. From a very young age James Van Praagh was aware of a dimension that most of us cannot see, and he has dedicated his life to explaining it to the rest of us. Ghosts Among Us takes us on an incredible journey into the spirit world that brings to light one of our greatest mysteries-what happens to us after we die?Van Praagh, the New York Times bestselling author and co-executive producer of the CBS series The Ghost Whisperer, shares his knowledge and life experience about ghosts, a subject that can seem to many of us both bizarre and terrifying. But when the world beyond is explained fully by an experienced guide, dismissal and apprehension can be turned into knowledge and inspiration. With incredible true ghost stories and surprising details about how ghosts actively participate in our lives, Van Praagh challenges us to question our perceptions and shows us how we can live more fully through understanding the world of spirits. Including eerily accurate readings, the author's development as a medium, and detailed how-to information, Ghosts Among Us is an all-encompassing guide to the supernatural.

Indeed, as a leading Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann states, 'Before we understand the place and the function of the council in the Church, we must, therefore, see the Church herself as a council.' Paul Valliere tells the story of councils and conciliar decision-making in the Christian Church from earliest times to the present. Drawing extensively upon the scholarship on conciliarism which has appeared in the last half-century, Valliere brings a broad ecumenical perspective to the study and shows how the conciliar tradition of the Christian past can serve as a resource for resolving conflicts in the Church today. The book presents a conciliarism which involves historical legacy, but which leads us forward, not backward, and which keeps the Church's collective eyes on the prize - the eschatological kingdom of God""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Throughout the centuries leading up to this era, the Jews of northern Europe prospered financially and intellectually, a trend that ran counter to the long-standing Christian conception of Jews as relics of the pre-history of the Church. In The Jew, the Cathedral and the Medieval City, Nina Rowe examines the sculptures as defining elements in the urban Jewish-Christian encounter. She locates the roots of the Synagoga-Ecclesia motif in antiquity and explores the theme's public manifestations at the cathedrals of Reims, Bamberg, and Strasbourg, considering each example in relation to local politics and culture. Ultimately, she demonstrates that royal and ecclesiastical policies to restrain the religious, social, and economic lives of Jews in the early thirteenth century found a material analog in lovely renderings of a downtrodden Synagoga, placed in the public arena of the city square""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Weigel’s approach is unusual insofar as it proceeds from ten (often highly skeptical) queries (e.g., “Does Belief in God Demean Us?”), meant to reflect prevailing contemporary views, which the author addresses in the course of portraying the outlines of Catholic belief. The influence of Pope John Paul’s thinking on Weigel is evident from the start: He quotes the pope extensively, and he makes use of the pope’s distinctive terminology (the result of his philosophical training as a phenomenologist) throughout. The result, in consequence, shares many of the same strengths and weaknesses that keen-eyed observers have credited to the Holy Father himself: original, bold, and erudite, but also frequently obscure, highly analogical, and sometimes downright eccentric in its meaning. And, also like the current papacy, the author is wont to straddle the fence a good deal—arguing, for example, that the exclusion of women from Holy Orders does not entail a repudiation of postwar feminism and that the (vehemently antidemocratic) political doctrines of modern popes were not contradicted by the Second Vatican Council’s endorsement of religious freedom. But this is a refreshing account all the same, forthright in its unwillingness to gloss over controversial questions and highly original in its reliance on literary works (e.g., the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the novels of Evelyn Waugh) to illustrate moral or philosophical arguments. In its contrast of the “brave new world” of modern technological man to the “better world” of the Church, it is very much a continuation of the underlying theme of Weigel’s biography of John Paul II. A bit too reverent to withstand scrutiny, this will find a welcome audience among believers but is unlikely to bring many others into their ranks.

Names in the ancient world did more than simply distinguish one person from another, they often conveyed the essential nature and character of a person. This is especially true when it comes to the names of God recorded in the Bible. Praying the Names of God explores the primary names and titles of God in the Old Testament to reveal the deeper meanings behind them.  El Shadday, Elohim, Adonay, Abba, El Elyon---God Almighty, Mighty Creator, Lord, Father, God Most High---these are just a few of the names and titles of God that yield rich insights into his nature and character. Praying the Names of God shows readers how to study and pray God's names by focusing each week on one of the primary names or titles of God.   Monday---readers study a portion of Scripture that reveals the name.      Tuesday--Thursday---readers pray specific Scripture passages related to the name.      Friday---readers pray Scripture promises connected to the name.  By incorporating the divine names and titles into their prayers---and learning about the biblical context in which the name was revealed---readers will gain a more intimate understanding of who God is and how he can be relied on in every circumstance of their lives.  Praying the Names of God is a unique devotional, one that offers a rich program of daily prayer and study designed to lead people into fresh encounters with the living God.

Far from a manual for conquering the realms of earth, air, fire, and water, The Satanic Bible is Anton LaVey's manifesto of a new religion separate from the ""traditional"" Judeo-Christian definitions of Satanism. While LaVey rails against the deceit of the Christian church and white magicians, he busily weaves his own deceptions.  The Satanic Bible claims the heritage of a horde of evil deities--Bile', Dagon, Moloch, and Yao Tzin to name a few--but these ancient gods have no coherent connection between each other or to Satanism, except that all have been categorized by Christianity as ""evil."" Calling on these ancient names like a magician shouting, ""Abracadabra,"" LaVey attempts to shatter the classical depiction of Satanism as a cult of black mass and child sacrifice. As the smoke clears, he leads us through a surprisingly logical argument in favor of a life focused on self-indulgence. The Satanic Bible is less bible and more philosophy (with a few rituals thrown in to keep us entertained), but this philosophy is the backbone of a religion that, until LaVey entered the scene, was merely a myth of the Christian church. It took LaVey, and The Satanic Bible, to turn this myth into a legitimate public religion. --Brian Patterson   Read more Read less",291 Want to read|13 Currently reading|13 Have read

An expanded edition with a new chapter on prayer and discussion questions  The heart of Christianity is transformation---a relationship with God that impacts not just our 'spiritual lives,' but every aspect of living. John Ortberg calls readers back to the dynamic heartbeat of Christianity---God's power to bring change and growth---and reveals both the how and why of transformation.  With a new chapter on prayer and added discussion questions, this expanded edition of The Life You've Always Wanted offers modern perspectives on the ancient path of the spiritual disciplines. But this is more than just a book about things to do to be a good Christian. It's a road map toward true transformation that starts not with the individual but with the object of the journey---Jesus Christ.  As with a marathon runner, the secret to winning the race lies not in trying harder, but in training consistently---training with the spiritual disciplines. The disciplines are neither taskmasters nor an end in themselves. Rather they are exercises that build strength and endurance for the road of growth. The fruit of the Spirit---joy, peace, kindness, etc.---are the signposts along the way.

But Christians have responded by making ""Christians,"" not ""disciples."" This, according to brilliant scholar and renowned Christian thinker Dallas Willard, has been the church's Great Omission.""The word disciple occurs 269 times in the New Testament,"" writes Willard. ""Christian is found three times and was first introduced to refer precisely to disciples of Jesus. . . . The New Testament is a book about disciples, by disciples, and for disciples of Jesus Christ. But the point is not merely verbal. What is more important is that the kind of life we see in the earliest church is that of a special type of person. All of the assurances and benefits offered to humankind in the gospel evidently presuppose such a life and do not make realistic sense apart from it. The disciple of Jesus is not the deluxe or heavy-duty model of the Christian -- especially padded, textured, streamlined, and empowered for the fast lane on the straight and narrow way. He or she stands on the pages of the New Testament as the first level of basic transportation in the Kingdom of God.""Willard boldly challenges the thought that we can be Christians without being disciples, or call ourselves Christians without applying this understanding of life in the Kingdom of God to every aspect of life on earth. He calls on believers to restore what should be the heart of Christianity -- being active disciples of Jesus Christ. Willard shows us that in the school of life, we are apprentices of the Teacher whose brilliance encourages us to rise above traditional church understanding and embrace the true meaning of discipleship -- an active, concrete, 24/7 life with Jesus.

From the first century BC onwards the traditionally hostile attitude of Greek and Roman philosophy was abandoned in favour of the view that religion was a source of philosophical knowledge. This book studies that change, not from the usual perspective of the history of religion, but as part of the wider tendency of Post-Hellenistic philosophy to open up to external, non-philosophical sources of knowledge and authority. It situates two key themes, ancient wisdom and cosmic hierarchy, in the context of Post-Hellenistic philosophy and traces their reconfigurations in contemporary literature and in the polemic between Jews, Christians and pagans. Overall, Post-Hellenistic philosophy displayed a relatively high degree of unity in its ideas on religion, which should not be reduced to a preparation for Neoplatonism""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At a time when participation in formal political process and membership of faith groups have both declined dramatically, community organizing has provided a new opportunity for small community groups, marginalized urban communities, and people of faith to engage in effective political action through the developments of inter-faith and cross-cultural coalitions of groups. In spite of its renewed popularity, little critical attention has been paid to community organizing. This book places community organizing within debates about the role of religion in the public sphere and the rise of public theology in recent years. The book explores the history, methodology, and achievements of community organizing, engaging in a series of conversations with key community organizers in the US and Britain. This volume breaks new ground by beginning to articulate a cross-cultural and inter-faith {u2018}Theology for Community Organizing{u2019} that arises from fresh readings of Liberation Theology.

What is the essence of this ancient faith? Is it a religion of peace or war? How does Allah differ from the God of Jews and Christians? Can an Islamic state be founded on democratic values such as pluralism and human rights? A writer and scholar of comparative religions, Reza Aslan has earned international acclaim for the passion and clarity he has brought to these questions. In No god but God, challenging the ""clash of civilizations"" mentality that has distorted our view of Islam, Aslan explains this critical faith in all its complexity, beauty, and compassion.Contrary to popular perception in the West, Islam is a religion firmly rooted in the prophetic traditions of the Jewish and Christian scriptures. Aslan begins with a vivid account of the social and religious milieu in which the Prophet Muhammad lilved. The revelations that Muhammad received in Mecca and Medina, which were recorded in the Quran, became the foundation for a radically more egalitarian community, the likes of which had never been seen before.Soon after his death, the Prophet's successors set about the overwhelming task of defining and interpreting Muhammad's message for future generations. Their efforts led to the development of a comprehensive code of conduct that was expected to regulate every aspect of the believer's life. But this attempt only widened the chasm between orthodox Islam and its two major sects, Shiism and Sufism, both of which Aslan discusses in rich detail.Finally, No god but God examines how, in the shadow of European colonialism, Muslims developed conflicting strategies to reconcile traditional Islamic values with the social and political realities of the modern world. With the emergence of the Islamic state in the twentieth century, this contest over the future of Islam has become a passionate, sometimes violent battle between those who seek to enforce a rigid and archaic legal code and those who struggle to harmonize the teachings of the Prophet with contemporary ideals of democracy and human rights. According to Reza Aslan, we are now living in the era of ""the Islamic Reformation."" No god but God is a persuasive and elegantly written account of the roots of this reformation and the future of Islamic faith.From the Hardcover edition.

As a naval officer, P.O.W., and one of America's most admired political leaders, John McCain has seen countless acts of bravery and self-sacrifice. Now, in this inspiring meditation on courage, he shares his most cherished stories of ordinary individuals who have risked everything to defend the people and principles they hold most dear.""We are taught to understand, correctly, that courage is not the absence of fear but the capacity for action despite our fears,"" McCain reminds us, as a way of introducing the stories of gures both famous and obscure that he nds most compelling--from the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to Sgt. Roy Benavidez, who ignored his own well-being to rescue eight of his men from an ambush in the Vietnam jungle; from 1960s civil rights leader John Lewis, who wrote, ""When I care about something, I'm prepared to take the long, hard road,"" to Hannah Senesh, who, in protecting her comrades in the Hungarian resistance against Hitler's SS, chose a martyr's death over a despot's mercy.These are some of the examples McCain turns to for inspiration and offers to others to help them summon the resolve to be both good and great. He explains the value of courage in both everyday actions and extraordinary feats. We learn why moral principles and physical courage are often not distinct quantities but two sides of the same coin. Most of all, readers discover how sometimes simply setting the right example can be the ultimate act of courage.Written by one of our most respected public gures, Why Courage Matters is that rare book with a message both timely and timeless. This is a work for anyone seeking to understand how the mystery and gift of courage can empower us and change our lives.From the Hardcover edition.

(Natalie Goldberg, bestselling author of Writing Down the Bones) While imprisoned for his attempts to reform the Church, 16th-century Spanish mystic John of the Cross composed many of his now classic poems of the soul's longing for God. Escaping his captors, John fell into a state of ecstasy and finished Dark Night of the Soul, with additional commentary for other seekers. Now, for the first time, a scholar unaffiliated with the Catholic Church has crafted ""an engaging and evocative translation of John's most famous treatise."" Drawing from Buddhist, Hindu and Judaic traditions, Mirabai Starr's fresh new translation restores the beauty and candor of the original while offering profound new relevance for the 21st-century seeker. ...

This new rapprochement with science has irrevocably altered how we think of God. It constitutes a foundation from which we cannot retreat, but from which we also cannot move forward until we examine the presumptions on which it is based. For the first time, Richard Coleman interprets in a clear and meaningful way the themes and practitioners that make this rapprochement different, and what it has achieved. But this book is more than description-it is an inquiry into whether Christian theology has lost its authentic voice by its singular focus on accommodating modern science.""--Publisher description.

For good and for evil, religion is the single greatest influence in the world. We accept as self-evident that competing economic systems (capitalist or communist) or clashing political parties (Republican or Democratic) propose very different solutions to our planet's problems. So why do we pretend that the world's religious traditions are different paths to the same God? We blur the sharp distinctions between religions at our own peril, argues religion scholar Stephen Prothero, and it is time to replace naive hopes of interreligious unity with deeper knowledge of religious differences.In Religious Literacy, Prothero demonstrated how little Americans know about their own religious traditions and why the world's religions should be taught in public schools. Now, in God Is Not One, Prothero provides readers with this much-needed content about each of the eight great religions. To claim that all religions are the same is to misunderstand that each attempts to solve a different human problem. For example:–Islam: the problem is pride / the solution is submission–Christianity: the problem is sin / the solution is salvation–Confucianism: the problem is chaos / the solution is social order–Buddhism: the problem is suffering / the solution is awakening–Judaism: the problem is exile / the solution is to return to GodProthero reveals each of these traditions on its own terms to create an indispensable guide for anyone who wants to better understand the big questions human beings have asked for millennia—and the disparate paths we are taking to answer them today. A bold polemical response to a generation of misguided scholarship, God Is Not One creates a new context for understanding religion in the twenty-first century and disproves the assumptions most of us make about the way the world's religions work.

Sarah Mortimer reveals the extent to which these discussions were shaped by the writing of the Socinians, an extremely influential group of heterodox writers. She provides the first treatment of Socinianism in England for over fifty years, demonstrating the interplay between theological ideas and political events in this period as well as the strong intellectual connections between England and Europe. Royalists used Socinian ideas to defend royal authority and the episcopal Church of England from both Parliamentarians and Thomas Hobbes. But Socinianism was also vigorously denounced and, after the Civil Wars, this attack on Socinianism was central to efforts to build a church under Cromwell and to provide toleration. The final chapters provide a new account of the religious settlement of the 1650s""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His radical affirmation of the revealed truth of Christianity changed the course of Christian theology in the twentieth century and is a source of inspiration for countless believers. Pope Pius XII declared that there had been nothing like Karl Barth's later thought since Thomas Aquinas. God Here and Now offers a succinct and accessible overview of that thought. In it, Barth outlines his position on the fundamental tenets of Christian belief, from the decision of faith to the authority of the Bible, and from the interpretation of grace to the significance of Jesus Christ.

The opening chapter examines the religious scene in the Near East in late antiquity, and the religious traditions which preceded Islam. Subsequent chapters investigate Islam's first century and the beginnings of its own traditions, the 'classical' period  from the accession of the Abbasids to the rise of the Buyid amirs, and thereafter the emergence of new forms of Islam in the middle period. Throughout, close attention is paid to the experiences of Jews and Christians, as well as Muslims. The book stresses that Islam did not appear all at once, but emerged slowly, as part of a prolonged process whereby it was differentiated from other religious traditions and, indeed, that much that we take as characteristic of Islam is in fact the product of the medieval period.

Holy warriors: a modern history of the crusades,Jonathan Phillips,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL2970000W?edition=ia%3Aholywarriorsmode0000phil_z7t4,/authors/OL454027A/Jonathan_Phillips,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28434607M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Penguin Random House|Language English|Pages 448,"From an internationally renowned expert, here is an accessible and utterly fascinating one-volume history of the Crusades, thrillingly told through the experiences of its many players--knights and sultans, kings and poets, Christians and Muslims. Jonathan Phillips traces the origins, expansion, decline, and conclusion of the Crusades and comments on their contemporary echoes--from the mysteries of the Templars to the grim reality of al-Qaeda. Holy Warriors puts the past in a new perspective and brilliantly sheds light on the origins of today's wars.Starting with Pope Urban II's emotive, groundbreaking speech in November 1095, in which he called for the recovery of Jerusalem from Islam by the First Crusade, Phillips traces the centuries-long conflict between two of the world's great faiths. Using songs, sermons, narratives, and letters of the period, he reveals how the success of the First Crusade inspired generations of kings to campaign for their own vainglory and set down a marker for the knights of Europe, men who increasingly blurred the boundaries between chivalry and crusading. In the Muslim world, early attempts to call a jihad fell upon deaf ears until the charisma of the Sultan Saladin brought the struggle to a climax. Yet the story that emerges has other dimensions--as never before, Phillips incorporates the holy wars within the story of medieval Christendom and Islam and shines new light on many truces, alliances, and diplomatic efforts that have been forgotten over the centuries.Holy Warriors also discusses how the term ""crusade"" survived into the modern era and how its redefinition through romantic literature and the drive for colonial empires during the nineteenth century gave it an energy and a resonance that persisted down to the alliance between Franco and the Church during the Spanish Civil War and right up to George W. Bush's pious ""war on terror.""Elegantly written, compulsively readable, and full of stunning new portraits of unforgettable real-life figures--from Richard the Lionhearted to Melisende, the formidable crusader queen of Jerusalem--Holy Warriors is a must-read for anyone interested in medieval Europe, as well as for those seeking to understand the history of religious conflict.From the Hardcover edition.

However, this Bible has also left a trail of pain. It is undeniable that the Bible is not always used for good. Sometimes the Bible can seem overtly evil. Sometimes its texts are terrible.   Bishop John Shelby Spong boldly approaches those texts that have been used through history to justify the denigration or persecution of others while carrying with them the implied and imposed authority of the claim that they were the ""Word of God."" As he exposes and challenges what he calls the ""terrible texts of the Bible"", laying bare the evil done by these texts in the name of God, he also seeks to redeem these texts, hoping to recover their ultimate depth and purpose. Spong looks specifically at texts used to justify homophobia, anti-Semitism, treating women as second-class humans, corporal punishment, and environmental degradation, but he also delivers a new picture of how Christians can use the Bible today. As Spong battles against the way the Bible has been used throughout history, he provides a new framework, introducing people to a proper way to engage this holy book of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

"The making of the monastic community of Fulda, c.744 - c.900",Janneke Raaijmakers,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16415627W,/authors/OL7057189A/Janneke_Raaijmakers,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""The monastic community of Fulda was one of the most powerful institutions in early medieval Europe. This book traces the development of the community from its foundation in the 740s over one and a half centuries, a period richly documented by a variety of texts and archaeological remains. These sources reveal how Fulda's success forced the monks to rethink their goals and the ways in which they sought to achieve them. Its close connection to the Carolingian royal court also makes Fulda a fascinating case study of how local events influenced life in the palace and vice versa. The importance of Fulda and the rich array of sources associated with it have long been recognised, but this is the first full study, bringing together theology, architectural history and archaeology. The result is a vivid picture of life in this monastery and also in early medieval religious communities in general""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Angels and demons came to form an integral part of the Spanish American cosmology, leading to the emergence of colonial urban and rural landscapes set within a strikingly theological framework. Belief in celestial and demonic spirits soon regulated and affected the daily lives of Spanish, Indigenous and Mestizo peoples, while missionary networks circulated these practices to create a widespread and generally accepted system of belief that flourished in seventeenth-century Baroque culture and spirituality. This study of angels and demons opens a particularly illuminating window onto intellectual and cultural developments in the centuries that followed the European encounter with America. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students of religious studies, anthropology of religion, history of ideas, Latin American colonial history and church history""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Pott & co.|Language English|Pages 92,"The spiritual life depends on self-recollection and detachment from the rush of life; it depends on facing frankly the thought of death; it is signalized, especially, by the identification of self with others, even of the guiltless with the guilty. Spirituality is sometimes spoken of as if it were a kind of moral luxury, a work of supererogation, a token of fastidiousness and over-refinement. It is nothing of the sort. Spirituality is simply morality carried to its farthest bounds; it is not an airy bauble of the fancy, it is of ""the tough fibre of the human heart.""Felix Adler (1884 - 1963) was an accomplished American screenwriter whose career spanned over 30 years.

Conservatives saw it as the final triumph of their agenda. Liberals were aghast. Everyone else wondered what to expect. Award-winning religion journalist David Gibson explores how a “war of ideas” will be the defining feature of this new papacy. Gibson persuasively argues that by tackling the modern world head-on Benedict XVI is gambling that he can make traditional, orthodox Catholicism the savior of contemporary society. But if the elderly Benedict fails in his battle with modernity, will Catholicism wind up as a “smaller-but-purer church”-a new kind of “fortress Catholicism” that some conservatives want? These fears are in the forefront for millions of American Catholics pressing for change. Gibson points to the early warning signs of a papacy hyper-focused on “right belief” and will show how the key decisions of this surprising papacy will profoundly impact the future of Catholicism.

His writings have been the subject of intensive scrutiny and re-evaluation over the past two decades, notably on the part of English-language Barth scholars who have often been at the forefront of fresh interpretation and creative appropriation of his theology. Study of Barth, both by graduate students and by established scholars, is a significant enterprise; literature on him and conferences devoted to his work abound; the Karl Barth Archive in Switzerland and the Center for Brath Studies at Princeton give institutional profile to these interests. Barth's work is also considered by many to be a significant resource for the intellectual life of the churches."" ""Drawing from the wide pool of Barth scholarship, and including translations of Barth's works, this series aims to function as a means by which writing on Barth, of the highest scholarly calibre, can find publication.

America's four gods: what we say about God- - and what that says about us,Paul Froese,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL15090768W?edition=ia%3Aamericasfourgods00froe,/authors/OL5009729A/Paul_Froese,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24068537M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English,"Despite all the hype surrounding the ""New Atheism,"" the United States remains one of the most religious nations on Earth. In fact, 95% of Americans believe in God -- a level of agreement rarely seen in American life. The greatest divisions in America are not between atheists and believers, or even between people of different faiths. What divides us, this groundbreaking book shows, is how we conceive of God and the role He plays in our daily lives. America's Four Gods draws on the most wide-ranging, comprehensive, and illuminating survey of American's religious beliefs ever conducted to offer a systematic exploration of how Americans view God. Paul Froese and Christopher Bader argue that many of America's most intractable social and political divisions emerge from religious convictions that are deeply held but rarely openly discussed. Drawing upon original survey data from thousands of Americans and a wealth of in-depth interviews from all parts of the country, Froese and Bader trace America's cultural and political diversity to its ultimate source -- differing opinions about God. They show that regardless of our religious tradition (or lack thereof), Americans worship four distinct types of God: The Authoritative God, who is both engaged in the world and judgmental; The Benevolent God, who loves and helps us in spite of our failings; The Critical God, who catalogs our sins but does not punish them (at least not in this life); and The Distant God, who stands apart from the world He created. The authors show that these four conceptions of God form the basis of our worldviews and are among the most powerful predictors of how we feel about the most contentious issues in American life. - Publisher.

People are often surprised to hear that the Vatican supports an astronomical observatory, yet the Vatican Observatory is one of the oldest astronomical institutes in the world, with its beginnings dating back to the reform of the calendar in 1582. Astronomy was one of the core subjects (along with arithmetic, geometry, and music) in the great medieval universities, taught by the Jesuits. Following the tradition of his order, Jesuit brother and working astronomer Guy Consolmagno considers himself to be a ""missionary of science;"" his mission: to undo the false assumption that the Church remains hostile to science. Blending memoir, science, history, and theology, Consolmagno takes us on a grand adventure. We revisit the infamous ""Galileo affair"" and see that it didn't unfold in quite the way we thought. We tour the Vatican's extensive meteorite collection and learn how astronomy progresses despite its dearth of tactile evidence. We get a rare glimpse into the world of working scientists and see how scientific discoveries are proposed and advanced (it hasn't changed much since Galileo's time). We learn the inside story of the ""Mars meteorite"": how can we be sure it's really from Mars, and why can't scientists agree on whether or not it contains evidence of life? With Consolmagno as our guide we travel to Japan and see how geology informs planetary science; we go to Africa and witness mankind's innate curiosity about the heavens, even in the midst of desperate poverty; and we hunt for meteorites in Antarctica. Most importantly, we see how science and religion can come together in one individual, and by extension, how they both are needed to answer the big questions. What would it mean to us if we did find life elsewhere in the universe? How did the world begin, and why does it follow natural laws? ""Science and Religion have an intimate tie,"" Brother Guy writes, ""Without faith in a Creator God, one who looks at His universe and declares it Good, how can you justify the belief that this universe is worth studying; indeed, that the universe even makes enough sense to be able to be studied?""

The Illuminati were a network of intellectuals who argued for self-government and against private property, yet the public is now often told that they were (and are) the very group that controls governments and defends private property around the world. Intervening in such misinformation, Lagalisse works with primary and secondary sources in multiple languages to set straight the history of the Left and illustrate the actual relationship between revolutionism, pantheistic occult philosophy, and the clandestine fraternity.  Exploring hidden correspondences between anarchism, Renaissance magic, and New Age movements, Lagalisse also advances critical scholarship regarding leftist attachments to secular politics. Inspired by anthropological fieldwork within today’s anarchist movements, her essay challenges anarchist atheism insofar as it poses practical challenges for coalition politics in today’s world.  Studying anarchism as a historical object, Occult Features of Anarchism also shows how the development of leftist theory and practice within clandestine masculine public spheres continues to inform contemporary anarchist understandings of the “political,” in which men’s oppression by the state becomes the prototype for power in general. Readers behold how gender and religion become privatized in radical counterculture, a historical process intimately linked to the privatization of gender and religion by the modern nation-state.

Outside The Catholic Worker (which she edited from 1933 to her death), Day wrote for no other publication so often and over such an extended period - covering six decades - as the independent Catholic journal of opinion, Commonweal.  Gathered here for the first time are Day's complete Commonweal pieces, including articles, reviews, and published letters-to-the-editor. They range from the personal to the polemical; from youthful enthusiasm to the gratitude of an aged warrior; sketches from works in progress; portraits of prisoners and dissidents; and a gifted reporter's dispatches from the flash points of mid-twentieth-century social and economic conflict. Day's writing offers readers not only an overview of her fascinating life but a compendium of her prophetic insights, spiritual depth, and unforgettable prose.

The authors outline a five-step hermeneutical procedure that includes: (1) historical-cultural and contextual analysis, (2) lexical-syntactical analysis, (3) theological analysis, (4) genre identification and analysis, and (5) application. The key distinctive of the book is its emphasis on practical steps of Bible study. Instead of giving readers long lists of rules they need to memorize, this book walks them through a simple step-by-step process that they can integrate into all future study of the Bible. The popular first edition has been translated into eight languages and has been used in a variety of settings. The second edition adds co-author Karelynne Ayayo and includes updated material covering developments in hermeneutics over the past twenty years.

As a result of the impasse reached by the current theologies of religions (exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism) in formulating a constructive approach in dialogue, this volume assesses the thought of the founding fathers of an academic Buddhist-Christian dialogue in search of clues that would encourage a comparativist approach. These founding fathers are considered to be three important representatives of the Kyoto School--Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, and Masao Abe--and John Cobb, an American process theologian. The guiding line for assessing their views of dialogue is the concept of human perfection, as it is expressed by the original traditions in Mahayana Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity. Following Abe's methodology in dialogue, an Orthodox contribution to comparative theology proposes a reciprocal enrichment of traditions, not by syncretistic means, but by providing a better understanding and even correction of one's own tradition when considering it in the light of the other, while using internal resources for making the necessary corrections."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Martos examines transubstantiation, consubstantiation, transignification, and other Eucharistic subtleties, but neglects the psychological implications of eating one's God, the immense folklore that has grown up around it, its relation to the Eleusinian mysteries, Mithraic banquets, etc. He opens each chapter on the individual sacraments with a section on """"parallels and precedents,"""" but his references to primitive ritual and Jewish liturgical practice are perfunctory and vague. He discusses changing Christian attitudes toward death without mentioning Philippe AriÃ¨s, brings up """"sacramental magic,"""" but not Bronislaw Malinowski. We hear a great deal of Rahner, Schillebeeckx, and Bernard Cooke, but nothing of James, Durkheim, Weber, or Jung. Even Eliade barely rates a notice. The topic, to be sure, is immense; no one could cover it completely. And for the reader willing to work within Martos' limits, the book provides a thorough, reliable outline of the evolution of the sacraments. Martos starts all his explanations (e.g., of Arianism) from scratch, and builds up to a level of considerable sophistication. His general bias is liberal, but he doesn't press it. So readers interested in studying the Catholic sacramental system from the inside will find this a useful guide, but anyone looking for full-bodied, wide-ranging Religionsgeschichte will be badly disappointed.

He remained in the West for seven years, going on to become one of the church's most tireless worldwide evangelists. He later conducted crusades in Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and South Africa. In 1884 he was named Missionary Bishop for Africa and he focused his energies on missionary activities on that continent. Taylor spent his last years in California, the site of his first mission. California life illustrated (1858) expands on his reminiscences in Seven years' street preaching in San Francisco (1857). He describes his voyage to California and gives details of family life, social life, politics and church history in San José, Santa Cruz, and Sacramento. He comments at length on California agriculture and mineral resources and offers a chapter on mining camp life.

He performed public guerrilla theater to shame slave masters, insisting that human bondage violated the fundamental principles of Christianity. He wrote a fiery, controversial book against bondage that Benjamin Franklin published in 1738. He lived in a cave, made his own clothes, refused to consume anything produced by slave labor, championed animal rights, and embraced vegetarianism. He acted on his ideals to create a new, practical, revolutionary way of life""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Success, true love, and the life you've always wanted. Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good things —gods that can't give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravings— and now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.The Bible tells us that the human heart is an ""idol- factory,"" taking good things and making them into idols that drive us. In Counterfeit Gods, Keller applies his trademark approach to show us how a proper understanding of the Bible reveals the unvarnished truth about societal ideals and our own hearts. This powerful message will cement Keller's reputation as a critical thinker and pastor, and comes at a crucial time—for both the faithful and the skeptical.

You become the Master of the Board---the victor over everyone else. But what happens after that, asks bestselling author John Ortberg. You know the answer: It all goes back in the box. You don't get to keep one token, one chip, one game card. In the end, the spoils of the game add up to nothing.  Using popular games as a metaphor for our temporal lives, When the Game Is Over, It All Goes Back in the Box neatly sorts out what's fleeting and what's permanent in God's kingdom. Being Master of the Board is not the point; being rich toward God is. Winning the game of life on Earth is a temporary victory; loving God and other people with all our hearts is an eternal one. Using humor, terrific stories, and a focus on winning 'the right trophies,' Ortberg paints a vivid picture of the priorities that all Christians will want to embrace.

The author also considers the challenges posed to Hinduism at the end of the twentieth century as it spreads far beyond India, and as concerns are raised about issues such as dowry, death, caste prejudice, and the place of women in Hindu society.

Davies also shows how the application of reader-response criticism, feminist criticism and postcolonial criticism have contributed to our understanding of selected passages in the book. Addressing theological issues, Davies considers three themes that occupy much of the content of Numbers, namely; land, purity and holiness, and rebellion. The concluding chapter considers the contentious issue of the historicity of the book of Numbers in the light of recent discussions concerning the historical value of the Old Testament. Davies shows how some of the issues Numbers raises – war, disease, survival, hunger, race relations – are among the perennial problems faced by nations across the centuries and across cultures. While individual passages within Numbers may reflect a questionable sense of morality, Davies demonstrates that the book, when viewed in its totality, encompasses a number of important theological themes which recur throughout the Old Testament: the interplay of forgiveness and judgment, and of sin and punishment, and the need to trust in the power of God rather than human might.

However, the systematic investigations of these topics have focused primarily on the effects of religion on domestic and international conflict. Scriptures, Shrines, Scapegoats, and World Politics offers a comprehensive evaluation of the role of religion in international relations, broadening the scope of investigation to such topics as the relationship between religion and cooperation, religion and conflict, and the relationship between religion and the quality of life. Religion is often manipulated by political elites to advance their principal goal of political survival. Zeev Maoz and Errol A. Henderson find that no specific religion is either consistently more bellicose or consistently more cooperative than other religions. However, religious similarity between states tends to reduce the propensity of conflict and increase the opportunity for security cooperation. The authors find a significant relationship between secularism and human security.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

J. D. Green offers an important new account of the causes, courses and consequences of the secularisation of English society. He argues that the critical cultural transformation of modern English society was forged in the agonised abandonment of a long-domesticated Protestant, Christian tradition between 1920 and 1960. Its effects were felt across the nation and amongst all classes. Yet their significance in the evolution of contemporary indigenous identities remains curiously neglected in most mainstream accounts of post-Victorian Britain. Dr Green traces the decline of English ecclesiastical institutions after 1918. He also investigates the eclipse of once-common moral sensibilities during the years up to 1945. Finally, he examines why subsequent efforts to reverse these trends so comprehensively failed. His work will be of enduring interest to modern historians, sociologists of religion, and all those concerned with the future of faith in Britain and beyond""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Gnostic Gospels of Jesus: The Definitive Collection of Mystical Gospels and Secret Books about Jesus of Nazareth,Marvin Meyer,religion,First published in 2005,/works/OL274402W,/authors/OL2629706A/Marvin_Meyer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9236022M-M.jpg,"Publish Date February 15, 2005|Publisher  HarperOne|Language English|Pages 368","For all those readers curious to read the actual texts of the Gnostic Gospels, here is the definitive collection of all the Gnostic Gospels and Gospel-like texts. Marvin Meyer, premier scholar of Gnostic and other Christian literature outside the New Testament, presents every Gnostic Gospel and Jesus text with a brilliant overall introduction, introductions to each text, and notes that explain everything the reader needs to know to understand the text. He includes his latest translations of not only the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, the Gospel of Mary, but other texts such as the Secret Book of John, which some scholars regard as the second part of the New Testament Gospel of John. The material is largely from the discovery at Nag Hammadi, freshly translated and introduced, but also includes texts found elsewhere. The texts, especially taken together, present an image of Jesus as the ultimate wisdom teacher, a kind of mysterious Jewish Zen master, who scandalized listeners by his radical egalitarianism (regarding women, slaves, the poor, the marginalized as of equal status, or more, with establishment male believers) and his insistence on living the message, spiritual experience, vs. outer observance only. For those wanting to learn more after reading The Da Vinci Code. This book provides the definitive next book for those looking for expert presentation of the alternative Gnostic stream of Christianity, in which there is no talk of crucifixion and Mary Magdalene is presented as the disciple that Jesus loved best. ""Marv is one of the original secret gospels scholars who has done an enormous amount of work to bring these texts to light. All of his research on the Nag Hammadi texts is having an incredible impact on our knowledge of early Christian history--it is virtually redefining it."" --Dr. Elaine Pagels, Princeton University   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How to become like Christ,Marcus Dods,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL8524831W,/authors/OL2852542A/Marcus_Dods,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL11685592M-M.jpg,"Publish Date December 12, 2006|Publisher  IndyPublish|Language English|Pages 60","I suppose there is almost no one who would deny, if it were put to him, that the greatest possible attainment a man can make in this world is likeness to The Lord Jesus Christ. Certainly no one would deny that there is nothing but character that we can carry out of life with us, and that our prospect of good in any future life will certainly vary with the resemblance of our character to that of Jesus Christ, which is to rule the whole future. We all admit that; but almost every one of us offers to himself some apology for not being like Christ, and has scarcely any clear reality of aim of becoming like Him. Why, we say to ourselves, or we say in our practice, it is really impossible in a world such as ours is to become perfectly holy. One or two men in a century may become great saints; given a certain natural disposition and given exceptionally favouring circumstances, men may become saintly; but surely the ordinary run of men, men such as we know ourselves to be, with secular disposition and with many strong, vigorous passions - surely we can really not be expected to become like Christ, or, if it is expected of us, we know that it is impossible. On the contrary, Paul says, ""We all,"" ""we all."" Every Christian has that for a destiny: to be changed into the image of his Lord. And he not only says so, but in this one verse he reveals to us the mode of becoming like Christ, and a mode, as we shall find, so simple and so infallible in its working that a man cannot understand it without renewing his hope that even he may one day become like Christ.Marcus Dods (1834 - 1909) was a Scottish divine and biblical scholar. He was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900). He was born at Belford, Northumberland, the youngest son of Rev. Marcus Dods, minister of the Scottish church of that town.

This book joins that conversation and examines afresh the historical sources that inform our picture of Constantine, the theological developments that occurred in the wake of his rise to power, and aspects of Constantine's legacy that have shaped church history.

'Pagan Britain' is a history of religious beliefs from the Old Stone Age to the coming of Christianity. This ambitious book integrates the latest evidence to survey our transformed - and transforming - understanding of early religious behaviour; and, also, the way in which that behaviour has been interpreted in recent times, as a mirror for modern dreams and fears. From the Palaeolithic era to the coming of Christianity and beyond, Hutton reveals the long development, rapid suppression and enduring cultural significance of paganism. Woven into the chronological narrative are numerous case studies of sacred sites both well-known - Stonehenge, Avebury, Seahenge and Maiden Castle - and more unusual far-flung locations across the mainland and coastal islands.

Biblically sound and cutting-edge fresh, Bad Girls already has helped thousands of women experience God's grace anew by learning more about our nefarious sisters.And there are more where they came from! With Really Bad Girls of the Bible, Liz reveals the power of God's sovereignty in the lives of other shady ladies we know by reputation but have rarely studied in depth: Bathsheba, the bathing beauty. Jael, the tent-peg-toting warrior princess. Herodias, the horrible beheader. Tamar, the widow and not-so-timid temptress. Athaliah, the deadly daughter of Jezebel. And three ancient women whose names we do not know but who have much to teach us: the ashamed Adulteress, the bewitching Medium of En Dor, and the desperate Bleeding Woman. The eye-opening stories of these eight ""Really Bad"" women demonstrate one really life-changing concept: the sovereign power of God to rule our hearts and our lives with grace, compassion, and hope.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Set in the context of the later Wars of Religion, it examines Henry's achievement in reforging an alliance with the towns by comparing his relationship with Catholic League, royal and Protestant towns. Annette Finley-Croswhite focuses on the symbiosis of three key issues: legitimacy, clientage, and absolutism. Henry's pursuit of political legitimacy and his success at winning the support of his urban subjects is traced over the course of his reign. Clientage is examined to show how Henry used patron-client relations to win over the towns and promote acceptance of his rule. By restoring legitimacy to the monarchy, Henry not only ended the religious wars but also strengthened the authority of the crown and laid the foundations of absolutism.

The contributors to this volume appraise, extend and apply different aspects of the conception of ""theological theology"". That theology should in fact be thoroughly theological means that theological discourse gains little by conforming to the canons of inquiry that govern other disciplines; it should rather focus its attention on its own unique subject, God and all things in relation to God, and should follow procedures that allow it to access and bear witness to these realities""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

An attempt is made to locate the boundaries between the Jewish and Christian, Russian and Western, Gnostic-pagan and Orthodox elements in Russian thought in this period. The author reflects personally on how the heritage of these thinkers, little analyzed or translated in the West, can help Orthodox (and other) Christians respond to Judaism (including “Messianic Judaism”), Zionism, and Christian antisemitism today.""

W. Norton & Company|Language English|Pages 402","By the end of the 19th century, almost all the great writers and artists, and intellectuals had abandoned Christianity, and many abandoned belief in God altogether. This was partly the result of scientific discovery, particularly the work of Charles Darwin in ""The Origin of Species"". But as Wilson demonstrates in such diverse lives as those of Gibbon, Kant, Marx, Carlyle, George Eliot, and Sigmund Freud, thought about religion had many sources. By 1900, the Church of England, so rich and politically and socially powerful, could be pronounced spiritually empty, however full its pews might be on a Sunday. Echoes of ""The Death of God"" could be found everywhere: in the revolutionary politics of Garibaldi and Lenin; in the poetry of Tennyson and the novels of Hardy; in the work of Freud, connecting this ""death"" to our deepest wishes; and in the decline of hierachical (male) authority and the first stirrings of feminism.

It focuses on the excesses of postmodernism, but also acknowledges serious problems with postmodernism's harshest critics. In short, Edward Slingerland argues that in order for the humanities to progress, its scholars need to take seriously contributions from the natural sciences - and particular research on human cognition - which demonstrate that any separation of the mind and the body is entirely untenable. The author provides suggestions for how humanists might begin to utilize these scientific discoveries without conceding that science has the last word on morality, religion, art, and literature. Calling into question such deeply entrenched dogmas as the 'blank slate' theory of nature, strong social constructivism, and the ideal of disembodied reason, What Science Offers the Humanities replaces the human-sciences divide with a more integrated approach to the study of culture.

Likewise, the door of heaven is the opening through which divine grace and truth flow to the world. Rick Joyner, best-selling author of The Final Quest, exposes the insidious cruelty of evil as manifested in jealousy, fear, racism,poverty and religious spirits. Breaking the Power of Evil equips the reader with the necessary weapons to create a breach in the access of evil to our world. Joyner declares that the battle is not territorial but is for the hearts of people. It is in the heart where evil must be broken and Joyner casts a prophetic light that will dispel the darkness and strengthen the soul.

As Ronda shares, Southerners don't just talk about God, they have a 'kitchen-table faith,' that feels like a comfortable, trusted neighbor who sits down and stays for a good, long visit. It's a faith you live and breathe, day-in, day-out, whether it's praying to the good Lord as you sit on the porch swing or finding joy in a delicious pan of cornbread. As Ronda says, Southern faith 'is a faith that is plain, simple, and sturdy, that is utilitarian in practice and that fits as comfortably in the hands of Southern women as a baby, an iron skillet, a hair brush, a telephone, or a broom.'   From stories of moonshine and revivals, Sunday dinners and new Easter outfits, prayers answered and griefs shared, you'll discover a faith that supports you when the trials and heartaches of life cause you to stumble, a faith that grabs you by the elbow and steadies you on the path.

This volume presents the results of the first systematic global investigation into how Christians respond to persecution. World-class scholars of global Christianity present first-hand research from most of the sites of the harshest persecution as well as the West and Latin America. Their findings make clear the nature of persecution, the reasons for it, Christian responses to it - both non-violent and confrontational - and the effects of these responses. Motivating the volume is the hope that this knowledge will empower all who would exercise solidarity with the world's persecuted Christians and will offer the victims strategies for a more effective response. This book is written for anyone concerned about the persecution of Christians or more generally about the human right of religious freedom, including scholars, activists, political and religious leaders, and those who work for international organizations.

In Beautiful Light Roy Anker seeks out the often unnoticed connections between film and religion and shows how even films that aren't overtly religious or Christian in their content can be filled with deep religious insights and spiritual meaning. Closely examining nine critically acclaimed films, including Magnolia, The Apostle, American Gigolo, and M. Night Shyamalan's Wide Awake, Anker analyzes the ways in which these movies explore what it means to be human--and what it means, as human beings, to wrestle with a sometimes unwieldy divine presence. Addressing questions of doubt and belief, despair and elation, hatred and love, Anker's work sheds ""beautiful light"" on some of Hollywood's most profound and memorable films. -- From back cover.

White began to assemble his magnum opus, a two volume work first published in 1896 as A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom. In correspondence he wrote that he intended the work to stake out a position between such religious orthodoxy as John Henry Newman's on one side and such secular scoffing as Robert Ingersoll's on the other. Historian Paul Carter declared that this book did as much as any other published work ""toward routing orthodoxy in the name of science."" Insofar as science and religion came to be widely viewed as enemies, with science holding the moral high ground, White inadvertently, became one of the most effective and influential advocates for unbelief.""--Provided by publisher.

Grapard provides a thought-provoking history of one aspect of the Japanese Shugendo tradition in Kyushu, by focusing on three cultic systems: Mount Hiko, Usa-Hachiman, and the Kunisaki Peninsula. Grapard draws from a rich range of theorists from the disciplines of geography, history, anthropology, sociology, and humanistic geography and situates the historical terrain of his research within a much larger context. This book includes detailed analyses of the geography of sacred sites, translations from many original texts, and discussions on rituals and social practices. Grapard studies Mount Hiko and the Kunisaki Peninsula, which was very influential in Japanese cultural and religious history throughout the ages. We are introduced to important information on archaic social structures and their religious traditions; the development of the cult to the deity Hachiman; a history of the interactions between Buddhism and local cults in Japan; a history of the Shugendo tradition of mountain religious ascetics, and much more. Mountain Mandalas sheds light on important aspects of Japan's religion and culture, and will be of interest to all scholars of Shinto and Japanese religion.

No book about the saints could ignore such beloved early martyrs as Agnes of Rome and Lucy of Syracuse but this book will introduce readers to many new women who have been canonized or beatified by Pope John Paul II. Of the more than 377 women mentioned in the book, 159 have been canonized or beatified since 1979. Approximately 100 of them lived in the twentieth century.This book is also unique in that it uses the saint's own words wherever possible, taking advantage of newly discovered archives, memoirs and other primary sources. It contains resources such as internet shrines and other websites, as well as little–known information on the canonization process.

Her marriage to William Jackson, a wealthy Denver Quaker, brought her to the West in 1875, and she soon became a Native American rights activist. She was sent west as part of a federal commission to investigate conditions among the Mission Indians in 1882, and her experiences as part of that commission inspired her famous 1884 novel Ramona. Glimpses of California (1902) reprints articles Jackson first published in 1883. She offers a narrative history of the California mission system and the early years of Los Angeles as a Hispanic community and the work of Junipero Serra as well as an analysis of the fate of the Mission Indians after those missions were dismantled. This section of the book is followed by a chapter on Southern California's ""outdoor industries"" -- livestock ranching and farming -- and one on Jackson's visit to Oregon.

When Sigmund Freud awakened modern interest in the dream a century ago, his theory of interpretation undermined the potential insights dreams had to offer. For Freud, dreams were little more than fragmented puzzle parts made up of events from our waking lives. Most of us today still live under Freud's far-reaching influence. When we wake up after experiencing a powerful series of images, we too readily explain them away or simply ignore them all together. Whatever emotion or insight the dream evokes slowly fades. But what if Freud was wrong? Unless we challenge his deeply-ingrained assumptions, we will forever lose the gift of our dreams.International bestselling author Rodger Kamenetz believes it is not too late to reclaim the lost power of our nightly visions. Kamenetz's exploration of the world of dreams reopens all the questions scientists and psychologists claimed to have settled long ago. The culmination of decades of research, The History of Last Night's Dream is a riveting intellectual and cultural investigation of dreams and what they have to teach us. We discover how the age-old struggle between what we dream and how we interpret our dreams has shaped Western culture from biblical times to today. Kamenetz introduces us to an eighty-seven-year-old female kabbalist in Jerusalem, a suave Tibetan Buddhist dream teacher in Copenhagen, and a crusty intuitive postman-turned-dream master in northern Vermont. He fearlessly delves into this mysterious inner realm and shows us that dreams are not only intensely meaningful but that they hold essential truths about who we are. In the end, each of us has the choice to embark on this illuminating path to the soul. But one thing is certain: our dreams will never be the same again.

A strong emphasis on state neutrality, a notoriously ambiguous concept, is a shared feature in the constitutional jurisprudence of the US Supreme Court and the German Federal Constitutional Court, but neutrality does not have the same meaning in both systems. In Germany neutrality tends to indicate more distance between church and state, whereas the opposite is the case in the United States. Neutrality also has other meanings in both systems, making straightforward comparison more difficult than it might seem. Although the underlying trajectory of neutrality is different in both countries, the discussion of neutrality breaks down into largely parallel themes. By examining those themes in a comparative perspective, the meaning of state neutrality in religion-state relations can be delineated""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Vivekananda – His Gospel of Man-making   Vivekananda's thoughts on the art of moulding people, combining scientific temper with a spiritual basis, are enshrined in this section. Transforming individuals was his main pre-occupation, for he believed that in such free, fearless persons of character, enlightenment and love lay the hope of the world. Transformation of persons is the only solution for all the ills that are found in the society. Swamiji has provided the best of remedies for today’s social and global illness. Vivekananda on Education and Religion – Interpretations and Allied Thoughts   This section highlighting not only the importance of Swami Vivekananda’s life and teachings but also the impact it has produced on the world citizens from various walks of life brings together the vast collection of observations on him. The multi-faceted personality of the great Swami, seen, known, adored and worshipped by many contemporaries, his and ours, get painted on the canvas of the last one century of Indian cultural history. Vivekananda – The Man and his Mission: Tributes   Swamiji's ideas springing forth from the fountainhead of his realization that each soul is potentially divine get amplified and reinforced in this section through several scholarly voices. This innate divinity of mankind was what Swamiji emphasized all the time, as he was fully convinced through his own life and of his Great Master that on this foundation alone can be built the beautiful edifice of human life grounded on character, dignity and integrity, not only of the individual but also of the nation. A Chronicle of Important Events in the Life and Times of Vivekananda   This part aims at presenting Swamiji's historic image in the context of the contemporary movements – political, social, cultural, etc. This is useful for a proper understanding of Swamiji’s mission in world perspective. Besides the principal event in the life of the Swami, the Chronicle thus covers significant landmarks in various spheres of human activity in India and abroad during the years 1863-1902. Vivekananda – A Voice from Across the Century   In the context of the centenary of Swamiji's appearance in the World's Parliament of Religions held at Chicago on September 11, 1893, this part highlights his visit to and the impact on the West, and his historic Chicago Address. Portraying him as a bridge between the East and the West, it shows how Vivekananda is a dynamic spiritual force to shape the future of the humanity. Vivekananda in Pictures   This part enables the readers to see Swamiji visually through illustrations. It contains a selection of eighty photographs projecting tapestry-like a visual review of the evolution of Naren into Vivekananda the prophet of ‘Awakened India’, of man’s awakening into his true Self, and of the efflorescence of the Divine in everyday human life. Vivekananda Literature – Books by and on Vivekananda   An exhaustive list of over 200 books by and on Swami Vivekananda is appended to the book for reference and further study.

Parakeets make delightful pets.  We cage them or clip their wings to keep them where we want them.  Scot McKnight contends that many, conservatives and liberals alike, attempt the same thing with the Bible.  We all try to tame it.  McKnight's The Blue Parakeet has emerged at the perfect time to cool the flames of a world on fire with contention and controversy. It calls Christians to a way to read the Bible that leads beyond old debates and denominational battles. It calls Christians to stop taming the Bible and to let it speak anew for a new generation.  In his books The Jesus Creed and Embracing Grace, Scot McKnight established himself as one of America's finest Christian thinkers, an author to be reckoned with.  In The Blue Parakeet, McKnight again touches the hearts and minds of today's Christians, this time challenging them to rethink how to read the Bible, not just to puzzle it together into some systematic theology but to see it as a Story that we're summoned to enter and to carry forward in our day.  In his own inimitable style, McKnight sets traditional and liberal Christianity on its ear, leaving readers equipped, encouraged, and emboldened to be the people of faith they long to be.

The hardball approach of the religious right? Or is there a more productive way to engage our culture?  Dean Merrill, a former vice president with Focus on the Family, challenges us to transform society--and our own hearts--from the inside out. Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Church is about attitude, about living out our convictions in a Christ-like manner instead of bullying our way into the system like any other loud and selfish government lobby.  Merrill shows why returning to the 'good old days' is a wish based on a myth. He reveals how God has worked mightily throughout history in spite of decadent cultures, and how he can and will work today in the American culture. Far from a prescription for apathy, this book is a passionate call to Kingdom activity -- and our mission as ambassadors to a world Christ died for, not as conquerors who would remake it in our own image.

In this book Rutledge addresses the issues and controversies that have caused pastors to speak of the cross only in the most general, bland terms, precluding a full understanding and embrace of the gospel by their congregations. Countering our contemporary tendency to bypass Jesus' crucifixion, Rutledge in these pages examines in depth all the various themes and motifs used by the New Testament evangelists and apostolic writers to explain the meaning of the cross of Christ. She mines the classical writings of the Church Fathers, the medieval scholastics, and the Reformers as well as more recent scholarship, while bringing them all into contemporary context. Widely known for her preaching, Rutledge seeks to encourage preachers, teachers, and anyone else interested in what Christians believe to be the central event of world history. - Publisher.

How did Hamas grow to be so powerful? Who supports it? What is its future? This essential insight into Hamas answers these questions.  Milton-Edwards and Farrell have between them spent decades researching and reporting from the heartlands of the Hamas movement and gained unrivalled access to the world of Islamic resistance and radical Islam in its potent Palestinian form.  Drawing on their frontline experiences of recent events, their access to secret documents from the western intelligence community and interviews with leaders, militants, and commanders of Hamas' armed battalions, they reveal the full story of Hamas and the future of political Islam in the Middle East.  Milton-Edwards and Farrell show Hamas to be a broad and thus more powerful regional phenomenon than previously thought, and by doing so contend that it is now time to rethink the war and the nature of Islam and its role in the Middle East. - Publisher.

Benjamin L. Corey thought he was suffering a crisis of faith, but it turned out to be a spiritual awakening. Corey became aware that the constant fear of hell and judgment that defined his Christian faith was out of sync with the idea that God acts from love, and promises to deliver us from fear. In the wake of this realization came newfound insights--from reading the Bible to re-examining American life and the church's role in the wider world. Corey learned that what he had been taught was a distorted version of Christianity that was not only untrue but caused real spiritual harm. He also discovered that he wasn't alone. Many Christians are yearning to distinguish between the Christianity that has become a rigid American civil religion and the authentic Christian faith embodied in Jesus. As he recounts his own spiritual journey, Corey offers a powerful and inspiring message of hope for every Christian increasingly frustrated with the church today. Do not be discouraged, he assures them. You do not need to give up your faith; you can rediscover the reality of a vibrant Christianity that delivers us from fear and inspires and guides us all today""--Amazon.com.

The reason is that Ethiopia is an ancient society anchored in religiously laden value system. As a result, the ready-made changes tailored by the political entrepreneurs with no participation of the grassroots did not suit social memory of the mass. Instead of sudden rapture, this calls for the continuity of some elements of traditional values. This study therefore aims to use the metaphor of covenant thinking as a hermeneutical tool that can be used as medium to negotiate change and transition without fear of risking cultural identity""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Sheila Fitzpatrick has collected together not only the classics of the revisionist period including Moshe Lewin, but also new work by young Russian, American and European scholars, in an attempt to reassess this contentious and deeply-politicised subject. The articles are contextualised by a thorough introduction to the totalitarian/revisionist arguments. Eschewing an exclusive high political focus, the book draws together work on class, identity, gender, work and agency. Stalinism offers a nuanced navigation of an emotive and misrepresented chapter of the Russian past.Books in Series:Atlantic American SocietiesDiversity and Unity in Early North AmericaThe French RevolutionGender and American History Since 1890The Israel/Palestein QuestionNazism and German Society 1933-1945The Origins of the Cold WarReformation to RevolutionThe Revolutions of 1989Segregation and Apartheid in Twentieth Century South AfricaSociety and Culture in the Slave SouthStalinismForthcoming: Global FeminismsThe Chinese Revolution   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But what if we approached the Bible differently, and instead of transforming the text to meet our needs, allowed it to transform us?That's exactly the idea behind Life with God, Richard J. Foster's much-anticipated book on the Bible. Foster, bestselling author of Celebration of Discipline and general editor of The Renovare Spiritual Formation Bible, claims that God has superintended the writing of Scripture so that it serves as the most reliable guide for Christian spiritual formation. According to Foster, the Bible is all about human life ""with God."" As we read Scripture, we should consider how exactly God is with us in each story and allow ourselves to be spiritually transformed. By opening our whole selves—mind, body, spirit, thoughts, behavior, and will—to the page before us, we begin to grasp all the Bible has to teach about prayer, obedience, compassion, virtue, and grace and apply it to our everyday lives to achieve a deeper relationship with God.With a wealth of examples and simple yet crucial insights, Life with God is an indispensable guide to approaching the Bible through the lens of Christian spiritual formation, revealing that reading the Bible for interior transformation is a far different endeavor than reading the Bible for historical knowledge, literary appreciation, or religious instruction.

Regarded as the holiest object in the world by the Jewish and Islamic faiths, the Ark suddenly disappeared from Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem over 2,500 years ago and was lost to the world - apparently forever."" ""Acclaimed scholar and adventurer Tudor Parfitt embarked on an epic journey across the Middle East, the Pacific and Africa to find the lost Ark. The trail took him from ancient codes and documents in Oxford and Jerusalem to the legends of a strange tribe near the Limpopo river, and to ground-breaking discoveries in modern genetic science."" ""But some people didn't want the Ark to be found. In his travels, Parfitt was ambushed, trailed, shot at and narrowly escaped being kidnapped. His search finally led him to an ancient artefact identical to the biblical description of the ark."" ""In The Lost Ark of the Covenant, Tudor Parfitt succeeds in blending rigorous historical scholarship with all the twists and turns of a gripping detective novel.

In Joseph's Bones, Segal approaches the Bible from this fresh perspective-one framed by the story of the Israelites' fidelity to Joseph-and finds something unexpected: an account of the human condition that reads like an existential novel about the struggle of mankind against the unpredictable and often unwarranted wrath of God.

It seems that all of life has its assigned place on the stone steps leading down to the Ganges. Some are used for bathing, others for laundry, washing buffalo, puja (worship, ceremonial offering), and this one for the business of death. The smells are of wood smoke, buffalo dung, urine and jasmine flowers. The sounds are of rustling kites and lowing cattle, crackling wood and prayer ... ' Piers Moore Ede first fell in love with Varanasi when he passed through it on his way to Nepal in search of wild honey hunters. In the decade that followed it continued to exert its pull on him, and so he returned to live there, to press his ear to its heartbeat and to discover what it is that makes the spiritual capital of India so unique. In this intoxicating 'city of 10,000 widows', where funeral pyres smoulder beside the river in which thousands of pilgrims bathe, and holiness and corruption walk side by side, Piers encounters sweet-makers and sadhus, mischievous boatmen and weary bureaucrats, silk weavers and musicians and discovers a remarkable interplay between death and life, light and dark.

Christina Lake does not want to be away at Christmas, but it's her duty to babysit one of London's hottest bands at their last-minute concert on Christmas Eve even though she had a fling with Harry, the band's lead singer, that never officially ended. Now forced to reconnect, Christina is starting to think that maybe London is exactly where she's supposed to be to get the perfect New Year's kiss - at least until she finds out that he's been lying the whole time. Can Harry find a way to prove himself before the clock strikes twelve? Or will the New Year ring in a new romance?   Read more Read less",11 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here philosopher Timothy Gordon forcefully disagrees, arguing that while anti-Catholic bias kept them from admitting their reliance on Aristotle, Aquinas, and the early Jesuits, our Protestant and Enlightenment Founding Fathers secretly held Catholic views about politics and nature.    Had they fully adhered to Catholic principles, argues Gordon, the ""Catholic republic"" that is America from its birth would not today be on the verge of social collapse. The instinctive Catholicism of our Founders would have prevented the cancerous growth of the state, our subsequent loss of liberties, the destruction of families, abortion on demand, the death of free markets, and the horrors of today's pervasive pagan culture.  In Catholic Republic, Gordon recounts our nation's clandestine history of publicly repudiating, yet privately relying on, Catholic ideas about politics and nature. At this late hour in the life of the Church and the world, America still can be saved, claims Gordon, if only we soon return to the Catholic principles that are the indispensable foundation of all successful republics.

In On Diaspora, Daniel Barber provides an intervention into this debate by arguing that a theory of secularism cannot be divorced from theories of religion, Christianity, and even being. Accordingly, Barber's argument ranges across matters proper to philosophy, religious studies, cultural studies, theology, and anthropology. It is able to do so in a coherent manner as a result of its overarching concern with the concept of diaspora. It is the concept of diaspora, Barber argues, that allows us to think in genuinely novel ways about the relationship between particularity and universality, and as a consequence about Christianity, religion, and secularism.

Many nones believe in God and even visit places of worship, but they do not identify with a specific faith or belong to a spiritual community. Corinna Nicolaou is a none, and in this layered narrative, she describes what it is like for her and thousands of others to live without religion or to be spiritual without committing to a specific faith. Nicolaou tours America's major traditional religions to see what, if anything, one might lack without God. She moves through Christianity's denominations, learning their tenets and worshiping alongside their followers. She travels to Los Angeles to immerse herself in Judaism, Berkeley to educate herself about Buddhism, and Dallas and Washington, D.C., to familiarize herself with Islam. She explores what light they can shed on the fears and failings of her past, and these encounters prove the significant role religion still plays in modern life. They also exemplify the vibrant relationship between religion and American culture and the enduring value it provides to immigrants and outsiders. Though she remains a devout none, Nicolaou's experiences reveal points of contact between the religious and the unaffiliated, suggesting that nones may be radically revising the practice of faith in contemporary times."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His life spanned the two defining moments in modern Tibetan history: the entry into Lhasa by British troops in 1904 and by Chinese troops in 1951. Recognized as an incarnate lama while he was a child, Gendun Chopel excelled in the traditional monastic curriculum and went on to become expert in fields as diverse as philosophy, history, linguistics, geography, and tantric Buddhism. Near the end of his life, before he was persecuted and imprisoned by the government of the young Dalai Lama, he would dictate the Adornment for Nagarjuna’s Thought, a work on Madhyamaka, or ""Middle Way,"" philosophy. It sparked controversy immediately upon its publication and continues to do so today.The Madman’s Middle Way presents the first English translation of this major Tibetan Buddhist work, accompanied by an essay on Gendun Chopel’s life liberally interspersed with passages from his writings. Donald S. Lopez Jr. also provides a commentary that sheds light on the doctrinal context of the Adornment and summarizes its key arguments. Ultimately, Lopez examines the long-standing debate over whether Gendun Chopel in fact is the author of the Adornment; the heated critical response to the work by Tibetan monks of the Dalai Lama’s sect; and what the Adornment tells us about Tibetan Buddhism’s encounter with modernity. The result is an insightful glimpse into a provocative and enigmatic work that will be of great interest to anyone seriously interested in Buddhism or Asian religions.

Soaring divorce rates; a crippled economy that rewards the few and punishes the many; religious-fueled hatred; record rates of depression-the headlines paint a grim picture. We inhabit a society that desperately needs fixing. But as Rabbi Shmuley Boteach reveals in his new book, Renewal, our society can made whole again when we as individuals make the choice to live a life based on values. For too long, conversations about values have been derailed by political movements trying to score points over hot-button issues like gay marriage or abortion. Boteach, one of our wisest and most respected counselors and spiritual experts, reaches deep into our history and into our shared religious legacy to revive the key universal values of Judaism for our struggling world. He presents these age-old ideas as guideposts for the challenges of modern times. These values, whose roots are in the Bible and thousands of years of Jewish spiritual living, can be applied to anyone in the modern world-from Christians and Muslims to atheists and agnostics-who want to renew their existence and recommit themselves to the most precious things in life. Renewal shows everyone how to use the timeless values of the Hebrew Bible and Judaism to live a more fulfilling, modern life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Joyce Meyer reveals the ways in which God delivers His word and the benefits of asking God for the sensitivity to hear His voice.

Missionary Travels in South Africa,David Livingstone,religion,First published in 1999,/works/OL8148147W,/authors/OL2716269A/David_Livingstone,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8843759M-M.jpg,"Publish Date June 2001|Publisher  Stackpole Books,              The Narrative Press|Language English|Pages 401","When Missionary Travels was first published in 1857, reviewers noted that the existing ideas about south central Africa would have to undergo a radical transformation. Land thought to be dry and mountainous was discovered to be fertile grassland with a wide variety of animal life, and the peoples that lived there, while sometimes suspicious, were often welcoming to an outsider. And great rivers existed as well; the Zambesi River was unknown to Europeans until Livingstone's visit.Dr. David Livingstone had lived in Africa for a number of years when he undertook the journey he writes about in this book. It is a remarkable story, told without self-aggrandizement. Livingstone walked over 4,000 miles, from Cape Town, South Africa through the Kalahari Desert to the coastal town of Loanda (now Luanda, Angola), and back along the Zambesi River to the east coast of Mozambique. Only members of the Makololo tribe, with whom he had established a firm friendship, accompanied him. His mission was to stop the slave trade.Livingstone begins the book with a brief overview of his personal life that reveals a fierce determination: he learned Latin, Greek, medicine and theology while still employed as a cotton-spinner in a Scottish mill. He had hoped to go to China as a missionary but went to Africa instead, and he describes some of his early experiences there. Livingstone pushed through the Kalahari Desert and the savannas and travelled along the Zambesi river. Eventually he came to the falls known by the natives as ""Mosi oa tunya"" (""smoke does sound there"") and which he named ""Victoria"":""After twenty minutes' sail from Kalai we came in sight, for the first time, of the columns of vapor appropriately called ""smoke"", rising at a distance of five or six miles, exactly as when large tracts of grass are burned in Africa. Five columns now arose, and, bending in the direction of the wind, they seemed placed against a low ridge covered with trees; the tops of the columns at this distance appeared to mingle with the clouds. They were white below, and higher up became dark, so as to simulate smoke very closely. The whole scene was extremely beautiful; the banks and islands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan vegetation of great variety of color and form. At the period of our visit several trees were spangled over with blossoms…It had never been seen before by European eyes; but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight.""He encountered a variety of peoples including both the nomadic Bushmen and the Bakalahari with their enormous herds, and he includes numerous descriptions of terrain and animal life. Sensitive descriptions of indigenous religious practices and customs also abound, and Livingstone assesses people and situations without romanticizing them. This is an important book, and reading it helps us to understand not only the Africa of the past but of the present.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Basis Of Morality,Annie Wood Besant,religion,First published in 2005,/works/OL8524451W,/authors/OL16933A/Annie_Wood_Besant,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL9316974M-M.jpg,"Publish Date August 10, 2007|Publisher  Dodo Press|Language English|Pages 48","Must religion and morals go together? Can one be taught without the other? It is a practical question for educationists, but apart from education, the question of the bedrock on which morals rest, the foundation on which a moral edifice can be built that will stand secure against the storms of life - that is a question of perennial interest, and it must be answered by each of us, if we would have a test of Right and Wrong, would know why Right is Right, why Wrong is Wrong.Mysticism cannot be spoken of as a basis of morality in the sense in which Revelation, Intuition, Utility and Evolution are bases, for it is valid only for the individual, not for everybody, for the true Mystic, the dictates of the Outer or Inner God are imperial, compelling, but to any one else they are entirely unauthoritative. None the less, as the influence of the Mystic is wide-reaching, and his dicta are accepted by many as a trustworthy revelation - are not all revelations communicated by Mystics? - or as the intuition of an illuminated conscience, or as showing the highest utility, or as the result of an evolution higher than the normal, it is worth while to consider their value.The true Mystic, realising God, has no need of any Scriptures, for he has touched the source whence all Scriptures flow. An ""enlightened"" Brahmana, says Shri Krshna, has no more need of the Vedas, than a man needs a tank in a place which is overflowing with water. The value of cisterns, of reservoirs, is past, when a man is seated beside an ever-flowing spring. As Dean Inge has pointed out, Mysticism is the most scientific form of religion, for it bases itself, as does all science, on experience and experiment - experiment being only a specialised form of experience, devised either to discover or to verify.These Mystics are a law unto themselves, for the inner law has replaced the external compulsion. More rigid, for it is the law of their own nature; more compelling, for it is the Voice of the divine Will; more exacting, for no pity, no pardon, is known to it; more all-embracing, for it sees the part only in the whole.But it has, it ought to have, no authority outside the Mystic himself. It may persuade, it may win, it may inspire, but it may not claim obedience as of right. For the Voice of the God within only becomes authoritative for another when the God within that other self answers the Mystic's appeal, and he recognises an ideal that he could not have formulated, unaided, for himself. The Mystic may shine as a Light, but a man must see with his own eyes, and there lies the world's safety; the materialised Mystic, strong as he is, cannot, by virtue of the God within him, enslave his fellow-men.

Using the monastic guidelines (bca? yig) as primary sources, this book examines the impact of Buddhist monastic institutions on Tibetan societies by looking at their monastic policies that deal with organization, economy, justice, and public relations. As this type of literature has not been studied in any detail, this is also an exploration of this genre, its parallels in other Buddhist cultures, its connection to the Vinaya, and its value as socio-historical source-material. The monastic guidelines are witness to certain socio-economic changes, but also contain rules that aim to change the monastery in order to preserve it. Throughout, the textual materials are supplemented with important information gained via oral history methods.    This monograph demonstrates how, and to what extent, the Tibetan monastery was guided by Buddhist monastic law, and argues that Buddhist ethics, as they are understood today, played hardly any role. Still, this study argues that the monastic institutions? influence on society was maintained not merely due to prevailing power-relations, but also because of certain deep-rooted Buddhist beliefs.""

Zo noemde zich de beweging van 'vernieuwde innigheid' die rond 1375 in Deventer onder inspiratie van Geert Grote en Florens Radewijns ontstond. Zij ontwikkelden een hervormingsprogramma, waarin de geestelijke omvorming van de mens centraal stond. Als broeder van het gemene leven speelde Gerard Zerbolt hierin een prominente rol. Hij gaf leiding aan een intensieve boekproductie, ijverde voor kerkelijke erkenning van de broederschap en maakte zich haar charisma eigen. Zo schreef hij twee toonaangevende handboeken voor de geestelijke weg. Meer dan Grote en Radewijns legde Gerard Zerbolt de grondslag voor een eigen spiritualiteit van de Moderne Devotie. De spiritualibus ascensionibus was nog niet in modern Nederlands vertaald. Reeds de Middelnederlandse vertaling droeg de titel Geestelijke opklimmingen. Dit boek beschrijft de weg van de mens, die uit de ongelijkenis met zijn Schepper wil terugkeren tot de oorspronkelijke gelijkenis. Tegenover de ondeugden die mensen kunnen bezielen, plaatst Gerard Zerbolt als tegenkrachten de deugden. Zijn geschrift bevat alle elementen om ook ons als mensen van deze tijd te helpen tot een nieuw mensbeeld en een nieuwe visie op de samenleving te komen.

This endeavor is rooted in the oeuvre of the late Austrian physicist Alfred Locker (1922-2005), who firmly believed that systems theory would finally emerged, some sixty years after Bertalanffy's seminal work on General System Theory, as a bridge-building metatheory between the sciences and religion. The studies contained in this collection enter into a critical evaluation and reassessment of the dominant postulates of scientific and theological systems and their interaction, including treatments of paradoxes (A. Locker), the inner sciences (Zwick), systems of meaning (Krieger), philosophy (Murphy), theology (Sedmak), isomorphies of religious symbols (Zwick), and the bridging of science and religion (A. Locker).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On one hand, the volume interrogates the possibilities of trinitarian theology and its ethical promise with regard to divine and creaturely relationality by putting it into specific engagement with discourses of pluralism, diversity, and multiplicity. It asks how trinitarian conceptions of divine multiplicity might open the Christian tradition to increasingly more creative and affirming visions of creaturely identities, difference, and relationality--including the specific difference of religious plurality. Alternatively, where can the triadic patterning evident in the Christian theological tradition be seen to have always exceeded the boundaries of Christian thought and experience, inhabiting and determining other religious traditions' conceptions of divine and/or creaturely reality in ways internal to their own distinctive histories? On the other hand, the volume interrogates the possibilities of various discourses on pluralism by putting them in a very particular and concrete pluralist context. Religious pluralists, comparative theologians, and scholars of religious studies are place alongside and put into conversation with theological and doctrinal work carried out within the (albeit broadly conceived) normative thread of the Christian trinitarian tradition. To what extent can pluralist discourse collect within itself a convergent diversity of orthodox, heterodox, postcolonial, process, poststructuralist, liberationist, and feminist sensibilities while avoiding irruptions of conflict, competition, or the logic of mutual exclusion? The goal of this collection is that, in the midst of these crisscrossing lines of cohering and/or conflictual difference about the theme of divine multiplicity, critical and imaginative visions of divine and creaturely relations might be generated that can inform future theological, philosophical and ethical work in transdisciplary, inter-religious and intra-religious contexts""--  ""By putting religious pluralists, comparative theologians, and scholars of religious studies into conversation with theologians doing doctrinal work within the Christian trinitarian tradition, this volume generates critical and imaginative visions of divine and creaturely relations that can inform future theological, philosophical and ethical work in interdisciplinary, inter-religious and intra-religious contexts""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

America's Puritan founder John Winthrop preached about ""a city upon a hill"", a phrase echoed more than three centuries later by President Ronald Reagan in his farewell address to the nation; Abraham Lincoln's two greatest speeches have been called ""sermons on the mount""; and Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" oration influenced a generation and changed history. From colonial times to the present, the sermon has motivated Americans to fight wars as well as fight for peace. Mighty speeches have called for the abolition of slavery and for the prohibition of alcohol. They have stirred conscientious objectors and demonstrators for the rights of the unborn. Sermons have provoked the mob mentality of witch hunts and blacklists, but they have also stirred activists in the women's and civil rights movements. The sermon has defined America at every step of its history, inspiring great acts of courage and comforting us in times of terror. A City Upon a Hill tells the story of these powerful words and how they shaped the destiny of a nation. A City Upon a Hill includes the story of Robert Hunt, the first preacher to brave the dangerous sea voyage to Jamestown; Jonathan Mayhew's ""most seditious sermon ever delivered,"" which incited Boston's Stamp Act riots in 1765; early calls for abolition and ""Captain-Preacher Nat"" Turner's bloody slave revolt of 1831; Henry Ward Beecher's sermon at Fort Sumter on the day of Lincoln's assassination; tent revivalist/prohibitionist Billy Sunday's ""booze sermon""; the challenging words of Martin Luther King Jr., which inspired the civil rights movement; Billy Graham's moving speeches as ""America's pastor"" and spiritual advisor to multiple U.S. presidents; and Jerry Falwell's legacy of changing the way America does politics. A City Upon a Hill provides a history of the United States as seen through the lens of the preached words—Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish—that inspired independence, constitutional amendments, and mili-tary victories, and also stirred our worst prejudices, selfish materialism, and stubborn divisiveness—all in the name of God.

Kushner, the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, a book  that shows us how to be our best selves even when things don't turn out as we had hoped--that is, how we can overcome life's disappointments.Kushner turns to the experience of Moses to find the requisite lessons of strength and faith. Moses towers over all others in the Old Testament: he is the man on the mountaintop to whom God speaks with unparalleled intimacy, and he leads his people out of bondage. But he is also deeply human, someone whose soaring triumphs are offset by frustration and longing: his people ignore his teachings, he is denied entrance to the Promised Land, his family suffers. But he overcomes.Through the example of Moses' remarkable resilience, we learn how to weather the disillusionment of dreams unfulfilled, the pain of a lost job or promotion, a child's failures, divorce or abandonment, and illness. We learn how to meet all disappointments with faith in ourselves and the future, and how to respond to heartbreak with understanding rather than bitterness and despair.This is a book of spiritual wisdom--as practical as it is inspiring.From the Hardcover edition.

Out of a creative encounter with the great minds whose religious and human vision has shaped our world, he has produced a rich body of work. In 112 representative texts, this book provides a comprehensive view of the key themes of von Balthasar's life and work. These characteristic texts also allow access to the fullness of faith itself. As the major section headings show, these selections touch on all the great themes that can occupy a person reflecting on the Christian faith: the human being, the church, life in faith and consummation. Introducing the reader is a 50-page ""portrait"" of von Balthasar which describes the personal encounters that have influenced him (Pryzwara, Barth, de Lubac, Adrienne von Speyr) and the chief aspects of his theological achievement.

And yet, do you hunger for spiritual ""meat"" that will help you grow as a Christian? Enduring Faith, an eight-week Bible study, delivers the perfect balance of in-depth study and manageable homework. Written in a devotional style with real-life examples, each day's reading is paired with discussion questions and space for journaling. You'll answer questions like: * What's the difference between blind faith and enduring faith? * How can I rest when my schedule is so hectic? * How do I respond to the tests I'm facing right now? * Am I trying to please God by following rules or by living by faith? Christ's work is final, complete, and perfect. You don't have to live under the bondage of a religious approach to God. Instead, enjoy liberty in Christ through a more intimate relationship with Jesus.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The verdict of the last generation on this debate was that it rested on a misunderstanding on Barth's side. Johnson gives us ample reason to question this verdict - and even more reason to take Barth's criticisms seriously. This is ecumenical theology at its best - sober and penetrating but unfailingly courteous. This book will be much-discussed.""--Publishers website.

The physical world is a much smaller place, often secular in appearance but still very much fueled by religious beliefs and conflict in the name of God. The Handy Religion Answer Book provides solid descriptions of major beliefs and rituals worldwide, affording the reader an understanding of contemporary religion. Clearly and eloquently written by a scholar with 30 years of study and teaching experience, Handy Religion is an easy-to-use comparative guide for anyone seeking basic religious literacy and intellectual history. The Handy Religion Answer Book looks specifically at the world’s religious traditions that trace their origins to the Middle East (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), South East Asia (Buddhism, Hinduism), and East Asia (Confucianism, Taoism, Shinto). Is there such a thing as a Muslim saint? What is the significance of the Star of David? How did so many different Christian churches come into being? What is the importance of the month of Ramadan? Do Hindus really believe in and worship many gods? Who was the Buddha and what does tradition say about his early life? Dr. John Renard examines each religion for history and sources, religious beliefs, signs and symbols, membership, community, diversity, leadership, authority, organization, personalities, and powers, holidays and regular observances, and customs and rituals. Handy Religion includes 125 illustrations, suggestions for further reading, and a global timeline of the history of religion.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Is it a recent phenomenon, aNew Age fad that will soon fade, or a long-standing and essential aspect of the American experience?      In Spiritual But Not Religious, Robert Fuller offers fascinating answers to these questions. He shows that alternative spiritual practices have a long and rich history in America, dating back to the colonial period, when church membership rarely exceeded 17% and interest in astrology,numerology, magic, and witchcraft ran high...

The God Delusion. God Is Not Great. Letter to a Christian Nation. Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith, for most Americans, faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious, and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate, learned, and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years, Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced ""doubts"" skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in The Reason for God, he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists, agnostics, and skeptics in mind, Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. The Reason for God challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn't Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn't the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be ""right"" and the rest ""wrong""? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book, Tim Keller uses literature, philosophy, real-life conversations and reasoning, and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth.

But they contend that the current fashionable emphasis on the dark side of the Christian record is an instance of willful historical illiteracy. In Christianity on Trial, Carroll and Shiflett dispassionately and systematically dissect the charges against Christianity—specifically that it has justified racism and misogyny, encouraged ignorance, and promoted the despoliation of the environment and even genocide. Then, in a narrative whose intellectual elegance and verve calls up comparisons to How the Irish Saved Civilization, they show how in fact the Christian tradition has not only injected morality into our political order, but softened brutal practices and confining superstitions, created the foundation for intellectual inquiry, and cultivated the charitable impulse. Christianity on Trial challenges readers of all beliefs—even those with a belief in disbelief itself—to question the anti-religious bigotry that thrives in our intellectual world and to reevaluate the role of Christianity not only as a source of consolation but of enlightenment and human liberation as well.

In these striking and sustaining depictions of seven remarkable women, Flinders brings to life a chorus of wisdom from the past that speaks with remarkable relevance to our contemporary spiritual quests.  From Clare of Assisi in the Middle East to Therese of Lisieux in the late nineteenth century, Flinders's compelling and refreshingly informal portraits reveal a common foundation of conviction, courage, and serenity in the lives of these great European Catholic mystics. Their distinctly female voices enrich their writings on the experience of the inner world, the nourishing role of friendship and community in our lives, and on finding our true work.  At its heart,  Enduring Grace is a living testament to how we can make peace with sorrow and disappointment and bring joy and transcendence into our lives.

She believes that we each need to become a revolutionary and  practice love every day.  And if Joyce has her way, the revolution will spread - person by person, house by house, town by town, until the old culture of selfishness and greed gives way to a new culture of concern for others. The book is a revolutionaries' manual, a hands-on primer for bringing the Golden Rule to life in the twenty-first century.  Meyer starts out by giving some stunning statistics. Right now...210,000 children will die this week because of poverty; 640 million children do not have adequate shelter;  every day, 3,000 children are abducted into the sex-trafficking industry; every day, 16,000 children die from  hunger-related causes. She goes on to say that although crisis is global, the solution is local. We can't solve the world's problems, but that isn't a reason to remain idle. LOVE REVOLUTION focuses on personal behavior on the local scale. It's not just a call to action; it is a call to being: being the person who goes out of your way to encourage someone who's out of hope; being the one who smiles at a stranger; being the one who is willing to do something for nothing.  The paradox:  when we do something for nothing, what we often get is something far greater.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

This study explores Nicholas Wolterstorff's theory of ""situated rationality"" from a theological point of view and argues that it is in fact a doxastic ethic based upon the theology of Wolterstorff's neo-Calvinist, Kuyperian background, which emerges in terms of his biblical ethic and eschatology of shalom. Situated rationality, the sum of Wolterstorff's decades-long work on epistemology and rationality is a shalom doxastic ethic--a Christian, common grace ethic of doxastic (even religious doxastic) pluralism."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It identifies the key concepts which can be found in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and examines the role and responsibilities of both state and citizen. The central issue addressed is the wearing of religious symbols in public areas. For this purpose, the author first looks at a number of topics, including the 'visibility' of religions and beliefs in the public sphere, and the notion of 'wearing religious symbols'. The questions policy makers need to ask when addressing issues concerning the wearing of religious symbols are then listed. Finally, the manual seeks to apply these principles and approaches to a number of key areas such as state employment, schools and universities, the private sector and the criminal justice system.--Publisher's description.

Setting the stage theologically the authors then unveil the great exploits of those who have gone before us and the impact that they made in their own times and on their own culture.

In that debate, the interpretation of mission which is popular in some circles within the ecumenical movement differs acutely from that which has been held traditionally by many evangelicals. The way forward is for the two sides to meet together in joint study of the Scripture, and to correct and enrich their own and others' understanding of mission by a deeper understanding of the biblical missionary theme and a fuller submission to it. Four adjectives describe this book: biblical, clear, fair, constructive. - Foreword.   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

Continuing global violence in the name of Islam reflects the deepest fears by certain Muslim factions of Western political, cultural, and economic encroachment. The solution to the current antagonism requires finding common ground upon which to build mutual respect and understanding. Who better to offer such an analysis than an American imam, someone with a foot in each world and the tools to examine the common roots of both Western and Muslim cultures; someone to explain to the non–Islamic West not just what went wrong with Islam, but what's right with Islam.Focused on finding solutions, not on determining fault, this is ultimately a hopeful, inspiring book. What's Right with Islam systematically lays out the reasons for the current dissonance between these cultures and offers a foundation and plan for improved relations. Wide–ranging in scope, What's Right with Islam elaborates in satisfying detail a vision for a Muslim world that can eventually embrace its own distinctive forms of democracy and capitalism, aspiring to a new Cordoba – a time when Jews, Christians, Muslims, and all other faith traditions will live together in peace and prosperity.

Little is known, however, about her own spiritual heights or her struggles. This collection of her writing and reflections, almost all of which have never been made public before, sheds light on Mother Teresa's interior life in a way that reveals the depth and intensity of her holiness for the first time.Compiled and presented by Fr. Brian Kolodiejchuk, M.C., who knew Mother Teresa for twenty years and is the postulator for her cause for sainthood and director of the Mother Teresa Center, MOTHER TERESA brings together letters she wrote to her spiritual advisors over decades. A moving chronicle of her spiritual journey--including moments, indeed years, of utter desolation--these letters reveal the secrets she shared only with her closest confidants. She emerges as a classic mystic whose inner life burned with the fire of charity and whose heart was tested and purified by an intense trial of faith, a true dark night of the soul.Published to coincide with the tenth anniversary of her death, MOTHER TERESA is an intimate portrait of a woman whose life and work continue to be admired by millions of people.

On the one hand, he does not attempt to delineate an ideal state in the classical fashion: to his mind, the Garden of Eden can be an archetype for nothing on earth. And on the other hand, he does not seek to achieve an ideological perspective on the proper relations between Church and State. In fact his Pilgrim City is shown to lie beyond utopianism, realism and the normal terms of political discourse. It stands, instead, as a singular challenge to the aspirations of politics in the West; and so standing it calls for a reassessment of his position in the history of political thought.""--Pub. desc.

Witmer draws on research from the areas of sociology, anthropology, archaeology and biblical studies to illuminate this aspect of Jesus' career, as well as the broader social implications of spirit possession in those he treated and the exorcisms themselves. Evidence found in the strands underlying the Synoptic Gospels is evaluated using the criteria of authenticity and comparative analysis in order to establish early and historical material. Questions posed and answered concern the historical plausibility of Jesus' role as exorcist, the possibility that his own career began with a period of spirit possession, and the meaning that his exorcisms conveyed to his first-century audience. Thus, the methodology includes textual analysis, sociological analysis of general cultural patterns within which first-century Palestine can be fitted, and anthropological analysis of the plausible functions of both spirit possession and exorcism in agrarian societies""--From publisher description.

Over the past two centuries scientific advances have made it clear that the universe is a story still unfolding. In this thought-provoking book, John F. Haught considers the deeper implications of this discovery. He contends that many others who have written books on life and the universe--including Stephen Hawking, Stephen Jay Gould, and Richard Dawkins--have overlooked a crucial aspect of cosmic history: the drama of life's awakening to interiority and religious awareness. Science may illuminate the outside story of the universe, but a full telling of the cosmic story cannot ignore the inside development that interiority represents. Haught addresses two primary questions: what does the arrival of religion tell us about the universe, and what does our understanding of the cosmos as an unfinished drama tell us about religion? The history of religion may be ambiguous and sometimes even barbarous, he asserts, but its role in the story of cosmic emergence and awakening must be taken into account.

Raised Congregationalist in New England, Mairs is a convert to Catholicism. She is also feminist, radical, politically activist — and all this in a church that tends to scorn her kind of progressive iconoclasm. A Dynamic God explores why and how Mairs deals with those contradictions and still identifies as Catholic (Zen Catholic, as she sometimes says), and what she finds to love in that tradition. Doctrinally, Mairs parts ways with the mainstream Church with few regrets. The people she worships with celebrate communion in each others’ homes without a priest, discuss politics, and defy Church opposition. But the Catholic rituals and imaginative structures that Mairs loves shape her life. In the Latino image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, for instance, she finds inspiration for a commitment to social justice. In her unmistakable, vibrant voice, she writes about sin and abundance; understanding vocation in a life circumscribed by multiple sclerosis; and celebrating life.

Religious conversion,Ira Katznelson,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL20973559W,/authors/OL453928A/Ira_Katznelson,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Ashgate|Language English|Pages 266,"Religious conversion - a shift in membership from one community of faith to another - can take diverse forms in radically different circumstances. As the essays in this volume demonstrate, conversion can be protracted or sudden, voluntary or coerced, small-scale or large. It may be the result of active missionary efforts, instrumental decisions, or intellectual or spiritual attraction to a different doctrine and practices. In order to investigate these multiple meanings, and how they may differ across time and space, this collection ranges far and wide across medieval and early modern Europe and beyond. From early Christian pilgrims to fifteenth-century Ethiopia; from the Islamisation of the eastern Mediterranean to Reformation Germany, the volume highlights salient features and key concepts that define religious conversion, particular the Jewish, Muslim and Christian experiences. By probing similarities and variations, continuities and fissures, the volume also extends the range of conversion to focus on matters less commonly examined, such as competition for the meaning of sacred space, changes to bodies, patterns of gender, and the ways conversion has been understood and narrated by actors and observers. In so doing, it promotes a layered approach that deepens inquiry by identifying and suggesting constellations of elements that both compose particular instances of conversion and help make systematic comparisons possible by indicating how to ask comparable questions of often vastly different situations.--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

New religious movements (NRMs) often present novel doctrines and advocate unfamiliar modes of behavior, and have therefore often been perceived as controversial. NRMs have, however, in recent years come to be treated in the same way as established religions, that is, as complex cultural phenomena involving myths, rituals and canonical texts. This Companion discusses key features of NRMs from a systematic, comparative perspective, summarizing results of forty years of research. The volume addresses NRMs that have caught media attention, including movements such as Scientology, New Age, the Neopagans, the Sai Baba movement and Jihadist movements active in a post-9/11 context.

This would prove to be the opening shot in an epic struggle between rival empires and faiths for control of the Mediterranean and the center of the world.In Empires of the Sea, acclaimed historian Roger Crowley has written his most mesmerizing work to date--a thrilling account of this brutal decades-long battle between Christendom and Islam for the soul of Europe, a fast-paced tale of spiraling intensity that ranges from Istanbul to the Gates of Gibraltar and features a cast of extraordinary characters: Barbarossa, ""The King of Evil,"" the pirate who terrified Europe; the risk-taking Emperor Charles V; the Knights of St. John, the last crusading order after the passing of the Templars; the messianic Pope Pius V; and the brilliant Christian admiral Don Juan of Austria. This struggle's brutal climax came between 1565 and 1571, seven years that witnessed a fight to the finish decided in a series of bloody set pieces: the epic siege of Malta, in which a tiny band of Christian defenders defied the might of the Ottoman army; the savage battle for Cyprus; and the apocalyptic last-ditch defense of southern Europe at Lepanto--one of the single most shocking days in world history. At the close of this cataclysmic naval encounter, the carnage was so great that the victors could barely sail away ""because of the countless corpses floating in the sea."" Lepanto fixed the frontiers of the Mediterranean world that we know today.Roger Crowley conjures up a wild cast of pirates, crusaders, and religious warriors struggling for supremacy and survival in a tale of slavery and galley warfare, desperate bravery and utter brutality, technology and Inca gold. Empires of the Sea is page-turning narrative history at its best--a story of extraordinary color and incident, rich in detail, full of surprises, and backed by a wealth of eyewitness accounts. It provides a crucial context for our own clash of civilizations.From the Hardcover edition.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

It was the first time an American president had acknowledged the existence of this rapidly growing segment of the population in such a public forum. And yet the reasons why more and more people are turning away from religion are still poorly understood. In Faith No More, Phil Zuckerman draws on in-depth interviews with people who have left religion to find out what's really behind the process of losing one's faith. According to a 2008 study, so many Americans claim no religion (15%, up from 8% in 1990) that this category now outranks every other religious group except Catholics and Baptists. Exploring the deeper stories within such survey data, Zuckerman shows that leaving one's faith is a highly personal, complex, and drawn-out process. And he finds that, rather than the cliche of the angry, nihilistic atheist, apostates are life-affirming, courageous, highly intelligent and inquisitive, and deeply moral. Zuckerman predicts that this trend toward nonbelief will likely continue and argues that the sooner we recognize that religion is frequently and freely rejected by all sorts of men and women, the sooner our understanding of the human condition will improve. The first book of its kind, Faith No More will appeal to anyone interested in the ""New Atheism"" and indeed to anyone wishing to more fully understand our changing relationship to religious faith. - Publisher.

Rather than focusing on the usual mainstream Protestant churches--Episcopal, Congregationalist, Methodist, Baptist, and Lutheran--Mooreinstead turns his attention to the equally important ""outsiders"" in the American religious experience and tests the realities of American religious pluralism against their history in America.  Through separate but interrelated chapters on seven influential groups of ""outsiders""--the Mormons,Catholics, Jews, Christian Scientists, Millennialists, 20th-century Protestant Fundamentalists, and the African-American churches--Moore shows that what was going on in mainstream churches may not have been the ""normal"" religious experience at all, and that many of these ""outside"" groups embodiedvalues that were, in fact, quintessentially American.

A Year with John Paul II showcases his most important teachings as well as his inspirational writings, in a daily devotional format that will inspire readers and deepen their reflections and meditations.With a foreword by Cardinal William W.

He survived the Nazi occupation during World War II and was ordained to the priesthood in 1946. He was appointed archbishop of Krakow by Pope Paul VI. On October 16, 1978, he ascended to the papacy, taking the name John Paul II. During his papacy he greeted an estimated sixteen million pilgrims at the Vatican's general audiences.

Many fail, but the reasons for failure or success are only too often not adequately studied. In this monograph two schemes started in Basutoland - now Lesotho - are intensively analysed and compared: the first, which was abandoned in 1961, primarily by means of documentary material; the second, which was and still is successful in at least part of the area, mainly through observation and field research. The analysis reveals the factors making for success or failure, particularly in the fields of politics, economics, and communication. The relevance of the study extends beyond Lesotho and even Africa, the analysis dealing with problems common to introduced social change and development in any part of the world.

The U.S. has bankrupted its policies in dealing with the Islamic world. As Fundamentalist Islam gains traction in Southeast Asia, backed by Saudi money, the U.S. must act swiftly to re-establish its credibility there and help defuse global terrorism. Bond and Simons present a bold plan to accomplish this key goal by substituting smart power (civilians in sneakers and sandals) for force (soldiers in combat boots) in Indonesia and the other nations of Southeast Asia, home to the world's greatest concentration of Muslims.    Introduces a critical new ""smart power"" approach to combat global terror  Written by two experts on Southeast Asia with extensive contacts in Washington and overseas  Tackles a crucial challenge to U.S. foreign policy and President Obama's administration  Examines a wide range of views and people, from Osama bin Laden-trained armed terrorists to radical clerics to western-trained officials who plead for Americans to come to their countries to teach, start small businesses, and improve health care     The Next Front offers exactly the kind of fresh, out-of-the-box thinking the United States needs to rebuild its credibility and transcend its foreign policy failures.

EvangeliouIn modern times, Hellenic philosophy is almost always equated with “rationalism,” pure and simple, devoid of any spiritual contents. This could not be further from the truth. The unique approach in this book corrects the modern view of what Hellenic philosophy is and what kind of wisdom it presents. In reality, the Platonic and Pythagorean philosophy is a way of life and a means of spiritual realization. Its objective is to establish for practitioners a harmony with the cosmos, purifying their souls, and leading to union with the Divine Intellect and the One. Such philosophy is closer to the eternal Mysteries than to the fashions of Western logicians. By the Platonists and Pythagoreans themselves, their philosophy has been regarded as the “Golden Chain” of succession and transmission of essential and unchangeable knowledge.

Haunted by a devastating curse, Coelho confesses to J., ""I've seen my dreams fall apart just when I seemed about to achieve them."" In response, J. gives Coelho a daunting task: He must find and speak with his guardian angel. ""The curse can be broken,"" he replies, ""if you complete the task.""Rising to the challenge, Paulo and his wife, Cristina, drop everything, pack their bags, and take off on a forty day adventure into the starkly beautiful and sometimes dangerous Mojave Desert—where they encounter more than they bargained for. A masterful blend of the exotic locales, dramatic adventure, and magical storytelling, for which Coelho's fictional works are renowned, this true-life account is at once a modern-day adventure and a metaphysical odyssey.

Fed up of religion telling you it has all the answers when it doesn't? Tired of hearing about divine mysteries when there aren't any? Irritated by the pious evangelistas telling you you're going to hell when you're obviously not? Exhausted by creationists...for simply being creationists? Want to know more about the so-called atheist conspiracy? Then this book is for you. For millennia priests and holy men have told countless conflicting tales about humanity's genesis and fate. Is it all nonsense? You bet it is. For round about the same amount of time they have also been saying that anyone devoid of faith is evil, immoral and responsible for all of society's ills. How wrong they are. This book contains all you need to know about what to pack for your journey on the enlightening road to atheism including a brief history of free thought - it goes back further than you think - all the way to an introductory who's who in purgatory for knowing there isn't a god. Learn that there are five types of atheism. Find out the difference between an atheist and an agnostic - a term invented by T. H. Huxley, famous for his defence of Darwin and how a deist differs from a theist. Discover the oxymoronic fact that Christians were originally called atheists. Read who Lucretius was and what his fellow materialists were about. And revel in the fact that atheists have nothing to defend but are happy that way...

Here, Kornfield (After the Ecstasy, the Laundry and A Path with Heart) offers an uncommonly specialized form of commonplace book, this one focusing on the issues of forgiveness and peacemaking. He casts his net wide, drawing spiritual wisdom from the expected sources (the Dhammapada, the Diamond Sutra, the teachings of the Buddha and various masters) as well as some surprising newcomers for a Buddhist book: Mother Teresa, Thomas Merton, Meister Eckhart, the Tao Te Ching, the New Testament and the Bhagavad Gita. Such eclecticism works well in its context; Kornfield strives to demonstrate that forgiveness is a process, and that it is possible for flawed and ordinary people to forgive others and themselves. A concluding section on inner peace is a humble and wise primer; Kornfield makes the point that true inner peace does not arise from withdrawal from the world but from greater connectedness with it. Each section includes actual rituals to encourage readers to forgive, practice lovingkindness and know peace. While the book mines well-trod territory, it does so with perception and grace.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|3 Have read

They examine the Korean Christian diaspora and missionary movements from South Korea and also give cutting-edge insights into North Korea. This book, the first recent  one-volume history and analysis of Korean Christianity in English, highlights the challenges faced by the Christian churches in view of Korea's distinctive and multireligious cultural heritage, South Korea's rapid rise in global economic power and the precarious state of North Korea, which threatens global peace. This History will be an important resource for all students of world Christianity, Korean studies and mission studies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Skeptics and True Believers is the culmination of that search. Acknowledging that the scientific and the spiritual communities are increasingly split, Raymo builds strong bridges between them. He illustrates his argument with thought-provoking stories offering compelling evidence that religion should embrace the reliable knowledge of the world that science provides, while science should respect and nourish humankind's need for spiritual sustenance. For anyone drawn to reflect on life's meaning and purpose, Chet Raymo's uncompromising skepticism and reverence for mystery will affirm and inspire. - Back cover.

Now Bruce Wilkinson wants to change what they do next.Anyone can do a good deed, but some good works can only happen by an act of God. Around the world these acts are called miracles--not that even religious people expect to see one any time soon. But what would happen if millions of ordinary people walked out each morning expecting God to deliver a miracle through them to a person in need? You Were Born for This starts with the dramatic premise that everyone at all times is in need of a miracle, and that God is ready to meet those needs supernaturally through ordinary people who are willing to learn the ""protocol of heaven."" In the straightforward, story-driven, highly motivating style for which he is known, Wilkinson describes how anyone can be a 'Delivery Guy' from heaven in such universally significant arenas of life as finances, practical help, relationships, purpose and spiritual growth.You Were Born for This will change how you see your world and show you what you can expect God to do through you to meet real needs. You will master seven simple tools of service, and come to say with confidence, ""I want to deliver a supernatural gift from God to someone in need today--and I expect to!""From the Hardcover edition.

Far more than a descriptive listing, it meets the urgent need for understanding them today on an individual, social and global basis. Broader than ""comparative religion,"" it uses philosophy, psychology, anthropology and other disciplines to answer the questions ""How does religion arise? How is it sustained? Why does it unite some people, and ostracise others?"" This combines in one volume the most important aspects of all religious beliefs. Beginning with the nature of myth and its functions, ritual, initiation and magic, and ending with the mystical and elegant approach of a number of modern physicists, it provides a holistic approach for anyone interested in religious or philosophical ideas, and is essential reading for all serious students of the subject. - Back cover.

Schleiermacher wrote against the backdrop of expanding European colonialism and nationalism, providing a powerful ethics of space for a rapidly shrinking planet. Selectively appropriated, Schleiermacher's spaces of modern theology can be a valuable contribution to contemporary attempts to theorize the importance of space and place in human geographies""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Worlds at War: The 2,500-Year Struggle Between East and West",Anthony Pagden,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL2909760W?edition=ia%3Aworldsatwar2500y00pagd,/authors/OL443256A/Anthony_Pagden,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17873348M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Random House|Language English,"Spanning two and a half millennia, Anthony Pagden's mesmerizing Worlds at War delves deep into the roots of the ""clash of civilizations"" between East and West that has always been a battle over ideas, and whose issues have never been more urgent.Worlds At War begins in the ancient world, where Greece saw its fight against the Persian Empire as one between freedom and slavery, between monarchy and democracy, between individuality and the worship of men as gods. Here, richly rendered, are the crucial battle of Marathon, considered the turning point of Greek and European history; the heroic attempt by the Greeks to turn the Persians back at Thermopylae; and Salamis, one of the greatest naval battles of all time, which put an end to the Persian threat forever.From there Pagden's story sweeps to Rome, which created the modern concepts of citizenship and the rule of law. Rome's leaders believed those they conquered to be free, while the various peoples of the East persisted in seeing their subjects as property. Pagden dramatizes the birth of Christianity in the East and its use in the West as an instrument of government, setting the stage for what would become, and has remained, a global battle of the secular against the sacred. Then Islam, at first ridiculed in Christian Europe, drives Pope Urban II to launch the Crusades, which transform the relationship between East and West into one of competing religious beliefs.Modern times bring a first world war, which among its many murky aims seeks to redesign the Muslim world by force. In our own era, Muslims now find themselves in unwelcoming Western societies, while the West seeks to enforce democracy and its own secular values through occupation in the East. Pagden ends on a cautionary note, warning that terrorism and war will continue as long as sacred and secular remain confused in the minds of so many.Eye-opening and compulsively readable, Worlds at War is a stunning work of history and a triumph of modern scholarship. It is bound to become the definitive work on the reasons behind the age-old and still escalating struggle that, more than any other, has come to define the modern world--a book for anyone seeking to know why ""we came to be the way we are.""From the Hardcover edition.

S. Lewis is a beloved writer and thinker and arguably the most important Christian intellectual of the twentieth century. His groundbreaking children's series The Chronicles of Narnia, lucid nonfiction titles such as Mere Christianity and The Problem of Pain, and thought-provoking fiction, including The Screwtape Letters and The Great Divorce, have become trusted companions for millions of readers. Here Lewis breathes new life into words and concepts that have dulled through time and familiarity, and his writings inevitably provoke deep thought and surprising revelations.Words to Live By contains an unprecedented selection of Lewis's writings, drawing from his most popular works, but also from his volumes of letters and his lesser-known essays and poems. His works are presented in accessible selections covering subjects from A to Z, including beauty, character, confession, doubt, family, holiness, and religion. Both a wonderful introduction to Lewis's thinking and a wise and insightful guide to key topics in the Christian life, these are truly words to live by.

Fresh out of college, Hannah Brencher moved to New York, expecting her life to look like a scene from Sex and the City. Instead, she found a city full of people who knew where they were going and what they were doing and didn't have time for a girl still trying to figure it all out. Lonely and depressed, she noticed a woman who looked like she felt the same way on the subway. Hannah did something strange--she wrote the woman a letter. She folded it, scribbled ""If you find this letter, it's for you..."" on the front and left it behind. When she realized that it made her feel better, she started writing and leaving love notes all over the city--in doctor's offices, in coat pockets, in library books, in bathroom stalls. Feeling crushed within a culture that only felt like connecting on a screen, she poured her heart out to complete strangers. She found solace in the idea that her words might brighten someone's day. Hannah's project took on a life of its own when she made an offer on her blog: She would handwrite a note and mail it to anyone who wanted one. Overnight, her inbox exploded with requests from people all over the world. Nearly 400 handwritten letters later, she started the website, The World Needs More Love Letters, which quickly grew. There is something about receiving a handwritten note that is so powerful in today's digital era. If You Find This Letter chronicles Hannah's attempts to bring more love into the world--and shows how she rediscovered her faith through the movement she started""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Tarcher/Penguin|Language English,"More than twenty-five hundred years ago, an Indianprince achieved enlightenment and becamethe “Awakened One. ” Yet, however extraordinaryPrince Siddhartha Gautama was, he was no divinity but a selfperfectedhuman being who brought a sweeping message tomankind. Walter Henry Nelson, a respected historical scholar andauthor, offers readers a distinctly accessible and authoritativebiography of the Buddha and his teachings. In this essential,gripping, and inspiring introduction for the general reader,Buddha explores ancient legends surrounding Buddhism’sfounder. It shows how the simple story and profound struggleof Prince Siddhartha, who died nearly five hundred years beforethe birth of Christ, were transformed into one of the world’sgreat religions. From tales of Gautama’s struggle to parables of the interventionof gods in his journey, Nelson takes readers through thehistorical life and ideals at the heart of a religion and philosophythat searches beyond materialism for the true aim of life.
