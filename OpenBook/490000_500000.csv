From the blog Clothes in Books:  ""There are six sections, each from a different era – one for each child, fitting in with their long-term ancestry – Norman, Viking, rich, poor. It is very carefully done, there is nothing slapdash about it, and it seems it was well-researched and I’m guessing accurate. The big difference to modern eyes is that it is very English – although Romans, Vikings and Normans are seen as immigrants, there is no space to look at any other nationalities coming into the country: and everyone is very white. But Streatfeild is anxious to explore issues of human rights, the rule of law, democracy and equality; and some of the thinking is very modern. It is certainly not as simplistic or as jingoistic as you might expect.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But how was she ever going to get there? She was thirty years old and still a parlour maid. She had no education, no money, and no mission board to send her. Set against the background of war between Japan and China during the 1930s, this book is the true story of how God led Gladys Aylward from the cold, foggy streets of London to the bleak mountain ranges of the Shanshi province. Her steadfast faith touched Chinese hearts from all walks of life; her nursing skill saved the lives of many war-stricken Chinese; and her compassion led her to provide a home for hundreds of Chinese children. - Back cover (original)  When Gladys Aylward first arrives in China, none of the Chinese will listen to her stories of God's love. But when Gladys calms a prison riot, the people call her Ai-wed-deh -- ""the Virtuous One."" Soon Gladys begins taking in orphan children, saving them from a life of filth and hunger in the streets. Then a fierce war breaks out between China and Japan. Gladys must trust God to guide her and her hundred adopted children through the mountains to safety. These Are My People is the true story of missionary Gladys Aylward and the Chinese children she rescued. - Back cover (refreshed).

However, many citizens feared that a new American government could take away certain of their rights, just as the British had done when they were colonies. It was soon agreed to add a series of ten amendments to the Constitution that would guarantee specific rights to all citizens and states. These first ten amendments are known as the Bill of Rights. Syl Sobel presents the amendments in this brand-new book, clearly explaining them in terms that grammar school students will find both meaningful and interesting. In the process, he points out fascinating facets of American constitutional history and law. He also explains how such rights as freedom of religion, speech, and assembly, as well as protections from unreasonable searches and a fair trial by jury apply to all of us in our daily lives. Here is a book that will be valued by teachers and enjoyed by students. Includes line illustrations, a glossary, and a suggested reading list.

Traditionally classified according to their shape, scientists now use DNA studies to refine the groupings of bacteria. This book examines bacteria that are found in virtually every environment—including those that are characterized by extreme heat, cold, and depth—and, of course, bacteria that are found inside our bodies. Intriguing information highlights the key role that bacteria play in shaping the ecology of our planet, how some bacteria make their own food while others feed on ready-made food, and how some do indeed cause disease, while most do not. Case studies examine the development of new vaccines against bacterial diseases and the use of bacteria to help fight pollution.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This collection of Bierce's best pieces reflects his life-long obsession with death and calamity and his undoubted talent for producing eloquently cynical short stories, including his famous ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""  Born in Ohio in 1842, Bierce served with bravery and distinction in the Union Army. After the war, he worked as a journalist both in the United States and in Britain, where he gained the acquaintance of W.S. Gilbert while they both contributed pieces to the magazine Fun. Eventually settling in San Francisco, he established himself as a critic and a satirist, becoming the literary arbiter of the West Coast. Bierce also served as Washington core respondent for Hearst's New York American and was a regular contributor to Cosmopolitan. In 1913, he disappeared while in Mexico.

In the six months since the Declaration of Independence had been signed, General George Washington and his troops had suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the British. It looked as though our struggle for independence might be doomed, when Washington made a bold decision. He would lead the main body of his army across the Delaware River and launch a surprise attack on enemy forces. Washington and his men were going against the odds. It seemed impossible that the ragtag Americans could succeed against the mightiest power in the world. But the men who started across the icy Delaware loved their country and their leader. Under his command they would turn the tide of battle and change the course of history. This story of the military campaign that began on Christmas night in 1776 will teach readers about the heroism, persistence, and patriotism of those who came before them. - Publisher.

Ideal for budding earth scientists, this in-depth resource demonstrates how to build a seismograph to record a simulated earthquake, compare pressure waves and shear waves—the two types of ground shocks—with a Slinky, and replicate a tsunami’s destructive effect on a “coastline” built in a bathtub. The chapters answer questions such as Can animals “predict” earthquakes? How have various cultures explained the movement of the earth throughout history? and Why do some volcanoes ooze rivers of lava while others blow their tops? Additional topics include how to earthquake-proof homes, protect oneself during a tremor, and construct simple models to test seismographs.

But when the plane flies into a storm, disaster strikes: lightning hits the plane, the fuselage rips apart, and Juliane finds herself falling thousands of feet to the forest floor, still strapped into her seat. The next morning, she wakes up, shocked to discover she's alive — and not too badly hurt. Still, she's stranded in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, far from home. Juliane's scientist parents have taught her how to survive there, but does she know enough to get herself to safety? This stand-alone addition to the Lost series tells the gripping real-life story of Koepcke's experience as the only survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Amazon.

Instead of Elvis and the Beatles, Marta Moreno Vega grew up worshipping Celia Cruz, Mario Bauza, and Arsenio Rodriguez. Their music could be heard on every radio in El Barrio and from the main stage at the legendary Palladium, where every weekend working-class kids dressed in their sharpest suits and highest heels and became mambo kings and queens. Spanish Harlem was a vibrant and dynamic world, but it was also a place of constant change, where the traditions of Puerto Rican parents clashed with their children's American ideals.A precocious little girl with wildly curly hair, Marta was the baby of the family and the favorite of her elderly abuela, who lived in the apartment down the hall. Abuela Luisa was the spiritual center of the family, an espiritista who smoked cigars and honored the Afro-Caribbean deities who had always protected their family. But it was Marta's brother, Chachito, who taught her the latest dance steps and called her from the pay phone at the Palladium at night so she could listen, huddled beneath the bedcovers, to the seductive rhythms of Tito Puente and his orchestra.In this luminous and lively memoir, Marta Moreno Vega calls forth the spirit of Puerto Rican New York and the music, mysticism, and traditions of a remarkable and quintessentially American childhood.""Viva Marta Moreno Vega! With honesty, humor, and love, she relives her coming-of-age in Spanish Harlem--the highs and the lows--eloquently documenting how deeply rooted West African cultural traditions are in her rich Puerto Rican heritage. Marta Vega's memoir makes me want to mambo."" --Susan Taylor, editorial director of Essence and author of Lessons in LivingFrom the Trade Paperback edition.

Pearl is the quiet, cautious, studious younger sister. Jodie is bold and brash and bad - but Pearl adores her anyway. When their parents get new jobs as the cook and caretaker at a fusty old boarding school, the girls have to move there and spend their summer holidays in the school with just a few children and staff for company. And when they arrive, things start to change. Jodie has always been the leader - but now it's Pearl who's making new friends like the amazingly tall, badger-watching Harley and Mrs Wilberforce, the wife of the Head who's confined to a wheelchair after an accident but introduces Pearl to wonderful new books. Jodie just seems to be getting into more and more trouble - arguing with Mum, scaring the little children, flirting with the gardener... When term begins, their strange summer is over. But things keep on changing. Jodie really doesn't fit in with the posh teenagers at the school. But Pearl is doing well in lessons and has even more friends. Maybe she doesn't need Jodie as much as she used to. But Jodie needs her. And when the school celebrations of Firework Night come around and a tragic event occurs, Pearl realises quite how much she does need her big sister...

Provides accounts of ten significant twentieth-century inventions and the people behind them, including the Wright brothers and their airplane, Robert Goddard and his rocket, and Gordon Gould and his laser. Each volume in the American Profiles series provides middle and high school students with concise information on eight to thirteen important and influential figures in a particular field of endeavor. Profiles are organized around a movement, event, or profession that has had a significant, lasting impact on American history and contemporary life. Essential biographical information is included for each figure, but the heart of each profile describes the critical achievements and contributions of the individual under consideration and assesses the subject's significance, not only in the context of the person's own lifetime, but in the broader sweep of American history. Placing each figure's achievements and contributions in a historical context makes each profile the ideal source for preparing reports. Students can use this framework as a basis for comparisons and contrasts, which will give them a better understanding of how individuals shape, and are shaped by, the times in which they live. Profiles: The Wright Brothers; Leo Baekeland; Robert Hutchings Goddard; Vladimir Zworykin; Chester Carlson; Howard Aiken; Gordon Gould; Ernest Lawrence; William Shockley; and Wilson Greatbatch.

All sport. Ever. From ancient times to the 21st century. In eight themed parts, Tim Harris describes the triumphs and breakthroughs – as well as the cheating and skulduggery - that have created the modern world of sport. Part One looks at sports grounds, from stadiums to ice rinks, explaining why golf courses have 18 holes, why boxing 'rings' are square and why Woolwich Arsenal ended up in Highbury. Why do wickets have three stumps? Why do we 'serve' in tennis and play soccer in halves? Part Two uncovers the stories behind sporting rules, while the next section, on sports equipment, shows why we row in eights, why cue balls have black dots and golf balls have dimples. Why do teams score more goals at home than away? Why have women got worse at shot putting? A history of sporting drugs reveals all. A swift history of 'speed sports' - from chariot racing to Grand Prix – explains why Formula One races clockwise, why racehorses aren't getting any faster and the odd origins of British racing green. Why compete for 'stakes' and hold 'whip-rounds'? Why doesn't the NFL play on Saturdays? A section on money and sport tells all. Then sport and politics uncovers the reasons why we ten-pin bowl with ninepins, why greyhounds aren't grey and why rowing is so posh. Lastly, a history of games and the media tells of racehorses starring on stage, boxers fighting inside cameras and just why the FA Cup draw uses wooden balls. Dip into it, or read it cover to cover - there's a 'Oh - now I get it' moment on every page. Sport: it's unique, funny, amazingly comprehensive and packed with extraordinary anecdotes to turn any reader into a sporting expert.

Every step forward is a victory.  Fauja Singh was born determined. He was also born with legs that wouldn’t allow him to play cricket with his friends or carry him to school miles from his village in Punjab. But that didn’t stop him. Working on his family’s farm, Fauja grew stronger to meet his own full potential.  He never stopped striving. At the age of 81, after a lifetime of making his body, mind, and heart stronger, Fauja decided to run his first marathon. He went on to break records all around the world and became the first person over 100 to complete the grueling long-distance race.  With exuberant text by Simran Jeet Singh and exhilarating illustrations by Baljinder Kaur, the true story of Fauja Singh reminds us that it’s both where we start and how we finish that make our journeys unforgettable. --penguinrandomhouse.com   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

James Levine's The Blue Notebook is that kind of book. It is the story of Batuk, an Indian girl who is taken to Mumbai from the countryside and sold into prostitution by her father; the blue notebook is her diary, in which she recalls her early childhood, records her life on the Common Street, and makes up beautiful and fantastic tales about a silver-eyed leopard and a poor boy who fells a giant with a single gold coin.  How did Levine, a British-born doctor at the Mayo Clinic, manage to conjure the voice of a fifteen-year-old female Indian prostitute? It all began, he told me, when, as part of his medical research, he was interviewing homeless children on a street in Mumbai known as the Street of Cages, where child prostitutes work. A young woman writing in a notebook outside her cage caught Levine's attention. The powerful image of a young prostitute engaged in the act of writing haunted him, and he himself began to write.The Blue Notebook brings us into the life of a young woman for whom stories are not just entertainment but a means of survival. Even as the novel humanizes and addresses the devastating global issue of child prostitution, it also delivers an inspiring message about the uplifting power of words and reading--a message that is so important to hold on to, especially in difficult times. Dr. Levine is donating all his U.S. proceeds from this book to help exploited children. Batuk's story can make a difference.Sincerely,Celina SpiegelPublisherFrom the Hardcover edition.

How can a youth worker offer wise care and counsel on such a controversial and confusing subject? Mark Yarhouse, Director of the Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity, writes to equip youth ministers so they can faithfully navigate the topic of sexual identity in a way that is honest, compassionate, and accessible.  Reframing the focus away from the culture wars, Yarhouse introduces readers to the conversation beginning with the developmental considerations in the formation of sexual identity—all of which occurs in the teen years. He offers practical and helpful ways to think about people who experience same-sex attraction. Sections of the book are also dedicated to helping parents respond to their children and teens who struggle with questions of sexual idenity, as well as how youth ministry can become more relevant in the lives of youth who are navigating these issues.

The house his father built transformed as needed into a place to play hide-and-seek, to eat bamboo shoots, and to be safe. For outside the home's walls, China was at war.

Thousands of these furry creatures had once lived on the great plains of North America. Yet by the 1980s, millions of prairie dogs—the ferret's main source of food—had been killed. Without them, the ferret was suddenly pushed to the brink of extinction. Would people find a way to help this endangered animal survive?  In Black-footed Ferrets: Back from the Brink, children relive the inspiring and heroic efforts of people who stepped in to save this remarkable creature when all seemed lost. Through this true tale of wildlife survival, children discover the bold and creative ideas that Americans and their government have used to protect and care for the country's endangered wildlife. Full-color photographs and a habitat map enrich this heartfelt story of conservationism and courage.  Black-footed Ferrets: Back from the Brink is part of Bearport's America's Animal Comebacks series.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
