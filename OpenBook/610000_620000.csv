He later turned to politics and became an even greater success as the main spokesman for conservative Republicans and then as president. After serving two terms as governor of California, he was elected president in 1980 and re-elected in 1984. Reagan brought a sense of optimism and good nature to his conservative cause. He worked to reduce the size of the federal government and passed major tax cuts. At the same time, he increased spending on the military, pledging to continue the fight against Soviet Communism. His determined actions contributed to the overthrow of Communist governments and the dissolution of the Soviet Union soon after he left office. In 1988, Reagan's vice president, George Bush, was elected president to carry on his policies. Includes color illustrations, a timeline, boxed features on events and people of special interest, and lively text introducing the featured president and the times in which he lived.

Before she was a famous musician with a number one album and a hit reality show, before she was a familiar face on MTV and in magazines, even before she was a character on the TV series Seventh Heaven, Ashlee Simpson was a little girl in Texas with a lot of spunk and personality. An accomplished ballet dancer on the outside and a punk rocker on the inside, Ashlee spent years quietly honing her talents while her parents helped her sister, Jessica, become a singing sensation. After getting a taste of the limelight while performing as a backup dancer for Jessica, Ashlee arrived in Hollywood ready to make her mark, and the rest is history. But while she has obviously come a long way from her Texas roots, Ashlee still has that unmistakable sparkle and individuality, which now set her apart from the rest of the pack of young female recording artists. Ashlee Simpson: Out of the Shadow and into the Spotlight tells the whole story behind how Ashlee found her voice and went from being America's favorite little sister to being a chart-topping superstar!

The editing is intelligent and unobtrusive, organizing the material around substantive issues within the general debate.

Animal Faces is a new series of books that captures the wonderful diversity of nature in the faces of animals. So much about an animal can be understood by looking at the characteristics of it's face--how it survives, how it sees, hears, tastes, and smells, how it stenches danger, how it communicates, and even how it attracts a mate or lures prey within striking distance. The characteristics of each of the faces featured in this book help animals thrive in at night. Learn how the flightless kiwi uses its keen sense of smell to find its food on the dark forest floor, and how the aye-aye uses its large eyes and ears to search the trees for insect prey. The colorful, detailed, and accurate portraits of animal faces-big and small-give a new meaning to in-your-face artwork. Whether in the rain forest or a cave, in the ocean or the sky, animal faces at night creates an amazing animal adventure you're sure to enjoy!
