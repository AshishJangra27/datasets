It takes an in-depth look at the work of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace as well as topics such as genetic modification, artificial selection and bacterial resistance. Starting with fossils and early life forms, the book investigates the development and diversification of life on Earth over billions of years. Topics such as adaptation and specification, as well as convergent evolution, symbiosis and genetics help illustrate how evolution affects all living beings and has lead to the huge biodiversity we have on our planet today. Mike Gordon's illustrations lend a light touch and add a dash of humour. Features biographies of key people, such as Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace, Thomas Huxley, James Watson and Francis Crick.
