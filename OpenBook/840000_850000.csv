He's spent his life trying to recapture those astral tones he heard at death's doorstep. Unable to grasp the elusive music, his latest commission has left him burned out and disillusioned.

Her dream is to be the chief conductor of one of the great orchestras: even the heartbreaking round of conducting competitions has not broken her spirit. And when she loses at an all-important contest in Paris, she is consoled by the glowing praise of the world-famous Czech conductor Alexander Stoltze and his brilliant young protege Karel Haken. Back in Edinburgh, Juliet and her equally-ambitious flatmates immerse themselves in the music they love - so they are there for Juliet when Karel crosses her path once more and leaves her with a broken heart. Then, at last, she gets her chance, as assistant conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra. She will somehow have to make her name in a make-or-break year, while overcoming a jealous rival and working for the man she once thought she could love.

In Bytes and Backbeats, however, Steve Savage deploys an innovative combination of designed recording projects, ethnographic studies of contemporary music practice, and critical analysis to challenge many of these traditional attitudes about the creation and reception of music. Savage adopts the notion of ""repurposing"" as central to understanding how every aspect of musical activity, from creation to reception, has been transformed, arguing that the tension within production between a naturalizing ""art"" and a self-conscious ""artifice"" reflects and feeds into our evolving notions of creativity, authenticity, and community.

Like Alice in Wonderland, he found his attempts to gain entry rebuffed at every turn.  An accidental introduction finally opened the door to the quartier's oddest hangout, where locals -- from university professors to pipefitters -- gather on Friday evenings to discuss music, love, and life over a glass of wine.Luc, the atelier's master, proves an excellent guide to the history of this most gloriously impractical of instruments.  A bewildering variety passes through his restorer's hands: delicate ancient pianofortes, one perhaps the onetime possession of Beethoven.  Great hulking beasts of thunderous voice.  And the modest piano ""with the heart of a lion"" that was to become Thad's own.What emerges is a warm and intuitive portrait of the secret Paris -- one closed to all but a knowing few.  The Piano Shop on the Left Bank is the perfect book for music lovers, or for anyone who longs to recapture a lost passion.From the Hardcover edition.

One of the most cosmopolitan of the great composers, much of Handel's music has remained in the popular repertory since his lifetime, and a broad variety of his music theatre works from Italian operas to English oratorios have experienced a dramatic renaissance since the late twentieth century. A large number of publications devoted to Handel's life and music have appeared from his own time to the present day, but The Cambridge Handel Encyclopedia is the first resource to gather the full range of present knowledge and leading new scholarship into a single volume for convenient and illuminating reference. Packed with 700 informative and accessible entries both long and short, this book is ideal for performers, scholars, students and music lovers who wish to explore the Handelian world""--Provided by publisher.

His life changes as he leaves behind the narrow horizons of communist Romania for the broad ones of the Western world, when he immigrates to Israel, later settling in England, then Sweden and, finally, the United States. The book follows chronologically and analytically his career path, from an ensemble violinist to an internationally-renowned conductor, based on his own accounts, extended research, and revealing testimonials. The Maestro’s rationale for having his biography written was, in his own words, “for the Westerners to understand my deep attachment to my Romanian roots, for the Romanians to know about my struggle for artistic affirmation in the Western world, and mostly for young conductors to realize that through passion, patience and persistence – and by not committing suicide after the first failure – the dedicated commitment to the profession bears fruit.”  Letters of John Keats    A Ray of Hope    Friends I've Never Met    The Richness of Night    The Best Poems and Poets of 2003    Who's Who in Poetry    Maestro Sergiu Comissiona's Biography    Click for quick sampling   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Punk kings who spread counterculture around the world, they've been cited as influences by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Green Day, Rancid and The Offspring; have toured with The Clash, The Ramones, The Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Nirvana, PiL, Minor Threat and others; and are the subject of two tribute albums. They are the band that introduced the term ""hardcore"" into punk lexicon and may have turned Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain onto a career in music. But punk is more than a style of music: it's a political act, and D.O.A. have always had a social conscience, having performed in support of Greenpeace, women's rape/crisis centres, prisoner's rights, and antinuke and antiglobalization organizations. Twenty-five years later D.O.A. can claim sales of hundreds of thousands of copies of their 11 albums and tours in 30 different countries, and they are still going strong. I, Shithead is Joey's personal, no-bullshit recollections of a life in punk, starting with the burgeoning punk movement and traversing a generation disillusioned with the status quo, who believed they could change the world: stories of riots, drinking, travelling, playing and conquering all manner of obstacles through sheer determination.

In this book, Tim Rutherford-Johnson considers musical composition against this changed backdrop, placing it in the context of globalization, digitization, and new media. Drawing connections with the other arts, in particular visual art and architecture, he expands the definition of Western art music to include forms of composition, experimental music, sound art, and crossover work from across the spectrum, inside and beyond the concert hall. Each chapter is a critical consideration of a wide range of composers, performers, works, and institutions, and develops a broad and rich picture of the new music ecosystem, from North American string quartets to Lebanese improvisers, from electroacoustic music studios in South America to ruined pianos in the Australian outback. Rutherford-Johnson puts forth a new approach to the study of contemporary music that relies less on taxonomies of style and technique than on the comparison of different responses to common themes of permission, fluidity, excess, and loss.

Oh yes, and I wanted to be a drummer ... ' Bruce Dickinson - Iron Maiden's legendary front man - is one of the world's most iconic singers and songwriters. But there are many strings to Bruce's bow, of which larger-than-life lead vocalist is just one. He is also an airline captain, aviation entrepreneur, motivational speaker, beer brewer, novelist, radio presenter, film scriptwriter and an international fencer: truly one of the most unique and interesting men in the world. In What Does this Button Do? Bruce contemplates the rollercoaster of life. He recounts - in his uniquely anarchic voice - the explosive exploits of his eccentric British childhood, the meteoric rise of Maiden, summoning the powers of darkness, the philosophy of fencing, brutishly beautiful Boeings and firmly dismissing cancer like an uninvited guest. Bold, honest, intelligent and funny, this long-awaited memoir captures the life, heart and mind of a true rock icon, and is guaranteed to inspire curious souls and hard-core fans alike.

The book therefore writes against that notion of absolute music which tends to be the paradigm for most musicological and analytical studies. It is concerned not so much with what music is, but with why and how meaning is constructed in instrumental music and what structures of knowledge need to be in place for such meaning to exist. From the thought of Vincenzo Galilei to that of Theodore Adorno, Daniel Chua suggests that instrumental music has always been a critical and negative force in modernity, even with its nineteenth-century apotheosis as 'absolute music'.

He didn't just hear the symphony when he fell in love with an Irish actress back in 1827, he wrote it. What was love like for the people who could really feel that song coming on? Symphony of Seduction tells of the romantic misadventures, tragedies and occasional triumphs of some of classical music's great composers, and traces the music that emerged as a result. For the eccentric Erik Satie, love came just once - and even then, not for long. Robert Schumann had to take his future father-in-law to court to win the right to marry. Hector Berlioz planned to murder a two-timing fiancée while dressed in drag, and Richard Wagner turned the temptation of adultery into a stage work that changed the course of music while rupturing his own marriage. Debussy's love triangle, Brahms' love for the wife of his insane mentor - all find expression in works we now consider to be some of the summits of creative achievement.Christopher Lawrence takes what we know about these love-crazed geniuses and adds a garnish of imagined pillow talk to recreate stories that are ultimately stranger than fiction - and come with a great soundtrack.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But until now, no reference work has appeared on the Bible as depicted in Western music. In The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More, scholars Siobhán Dowling Long and John F.A. Sawyer correct this gap in Biblical reference literature, providing a convenient guide to musical interpretations of the Bible. As well as providing examples of classical music from the Middle Ages through modern times, Dowling Long and Sawyer also examine the Bible's impact on popular culture with numerous entries on hymns, spirituals, musicals, film music, and contemporary popular music. Each entry contains essential information about the original context of the work (date, composer, etc.) and, where relevant, its afterlife in literature, film, politics, and liturgy. The book also includes an index of biblical references; an index of biblical names; a detailed timeline that places key events, works, and publications in their historical context; a bibliography; and a glossary of technical terms. The Bible in Music will fascinate anyone familiar with the Bible, but it is also designed to encourage choirs, musicians, musicologists, lecturers, teachers, and students of music and religious education to discover and perform lesser-known pieces, as well as helping them to listen to familiar music with a fresh perspective. - Back cover.

W. Norton|Language English|Pages 338,"American studies scholar and former deejay Alice Echols captures the experience of the Disco Years--on dance floors, at the movies, in the streets, and beneath the sheets. Disco may have presented itself as shallow and disposable--the platforms, polyester, and plastic vibe of it all--but the disco scene carved out a haven for gay men who reclaimed their sexuality on dance floors where they had once been surveilled and harassed; it thrust black women onto center stage as some of the genre's most prominent stars; and it paved the way for the opening of Studio 54 and the viral popularity of the shoestring-budget Saturday Night Fever, a movie that challenged traditional notions of masculinity, even for heterosexuals. But while exploring the cultural milieu, Echols never loses sight of the era's defining soundtrack, which propelled popular music into new sonic territory, influencing everything from rap and rock to techno and trance.--From publisher description.

Your body clock is skewed toward night-time; touring is an endless parade of sound checks, hotel rooms and road food; success for most is a long incremental climb. But you're doing what you love most in the whole world — and there's no substitute for the reception from a room full of people who love it too.Based on interviews with more than a hundred working musicians conducted over more than twenty years, this book covers every aspect of the music life: starting out, playing the first gig, making a record, living on the road, crafting the perfect set, writing great songs, and much more. Among the musicians who share their thoughts are: Harry Connick Jr., Gene Simmons, Tim Rice, Bruce Springsteen, Leo Kottke, Phil Everly, Jerry Garcia, Robbie Robertson, Paul Simon, Donald Fagen, John Lee Hooker, Jim Webb, Frank Zappa, Keith Richards, Carole King, Randy Newman, Neil Sedaka, Brenda Lee, John Sebastian, Bruce Hornsby, George Thorogood, Leonard Cohen, and many more. The result is a lifetime's worth of wisdom and experience that will open the eyes of fans and musicians alike.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Brings together diverse artistic, philosophical, historical and methodological approaches, creating a broad discourse on artistic experimentation, in dialogue with more orthodox notions of interpretation, and contributing to a better understanding of an ""experimental attitude"" in music. ""Experimentation"" is taken to be an adventurous compositional, interpretive, or performative attitude that can cut across different ages and styles; ""affinities"" suggests connectors and connections, convergences, contiguities, and adjacencies that are found in and through a diversity of approaches and topics. The golden thread running through the essays is the quest for ""inherently experimental"" musical practices, pursued variously from interrogating, descriptive, or challenging perspectives, and applied to music composed between the thirteenth and the twentieth centuries.

Weill's musical theater,Stephen Hinton,music,First published in 2012,/works/OL16283677W,/authors/OL1001827A/Stephen_Hinton,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  University of California Press|Language English,"In the first musicological study of Kurt Weill’s complete stage works, Stephen Hinton charts the full range of theatrical achievements by one of twentieth-century musical theater’s key figures. Hinton shows how Weill’s experiments with a range of genres—from one-act operas and plays with music to Broadway musicals and film-opera—became an indispensable part of the reforms he promoted during his brief but intense career. Confronting the divisive notion of “two Weills”—one European, the other American—Hinton adopts a broad and inclusive perspective, establishing criteria that allow aspects of continuity to emerge, particularly in matters of dramaturgy. Tracing his extraordinary journey as a composer, the book shows how Weill’s artistic ambitions led to his working with a remarkably heterogeneous collection of authors, such as Georg Kaiser, Bertolt Brecht, Moss Hart, Alan Jay Lerner, and Maxwell Anderson.

Campbell examines significant encounters which link Boulez to the work of a number of important philosophers and thinkers, including Adorno, Lévi-Strauss, Eco and Deleuze. Relating Boulez's music and ideas to broader currents of thought, the book illuminates a number of affinities linking music and philosophy, and also literature and visual art. These connections facilitate enhanced understanding of post-war modernist music and Boulez's distinctive approach to composition. Drawing on a wide range of previously unpublished documentary sources and providing musical analysis of a number of key scores, the book traces the changing musical, philosophical and intellectual currents which inform Boulez's work""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

High Voltage tells of his remarkable rise from working-class Glasgow and Sydney to the biggest stages in the world. The youngest of eight kids, Angus always seemed destined for a life in music, and it was his passion and determination that saw AC/DC become hard rock's greatest act. Over the years, Angus has endured the devastating deaths of iconic vocalist Bon Scott and his brother in arms Malcolm Young as well as the band's loss of singer Brian Johnson and drummer Phil Rudd. Yet the little guitar maestro's unique flair for performance and unstoppable drive to succeed has kept AC/DC not just on the rails, but at the top of the rock pile""--Page [4] of cover.

It communicates through movement, not words, and its history lies almost entirely abroad--in Russia, Italy, and France. In Celestial Bodies, dance critic Laura Jacobs makes the foreign familiar, providing a lively, poetic, and uniquely accessible introduction to the world of classical dance. Combining history, interviews with dancers, technical definitions, descriptions of performances, and personal stories, Jacobs offers an intimate and passionate guide to watching ballet and understanding the central elements of choreography.

And yet hip hop is the source of some of the most exciting developments in verse today. The media uproar in response to its controversial lyrical content has obscured hip hop’s revolution of poetic craft and experience: Only in rap music can the beat of a song render poetic meter audible, allowing an MC’s wordplay to move a club-full of eager listeners. Examining rap history’s most memorable lyricists and their inimitable techniques, literary scholar Adam Bradley argues that we must understand rap as poetry or miss the vanguard of poetry today. Book of Rhymes explores America’s least understood poets, unpacking their surprisingly complex craft, and according rap poetry the respect it deserves.

More than any previous '60s music autobiography, Joe Boyd's White Bicycles offers the real story of what it was like to be there at the time. His greatest coup is bringing to life the famously elusive figure of Nick Drake the first time he's been written about by anyone who knew him well. As well as the '60s heavy-hitters, this book also offers wonderfully vivid portraits of a whole host of other musicians: everyone from the great jazzman Coleman Hawkins to the folk diva Sandy Denny, Lonnie Johnson to Eric Clapton, The Incredible String Band to Fairport Convention.

We have to listen to what has made and makes a city. The ear is an integral part of the ?research tools? one needs to get a sense of any city. We have to listen to the sounds that made and make the expansive ?mother city?. Various of its constituent parts sound different from each other ? [T]here is the sound of the singing men and their choirs (?teams? they are called) in preparation for the longstanding annual Malay choral competitions. The lyrics from the various repertoires they perform are hardly ever written down. [?] There are texts of the hallowed ?Dutch songs? but these do not circulate easily and widely. Researchers dream of finding lyrics from decades ago, not to mention a few generations ago ? back to the early 19th century. This work by Denis Constant Martin and Armelle Gaulier provides us with a very useful selection of these songs. More than that, it is a critical sociological reflection of the place of these songs and their performers in the context that have given rise to them and sustains their relevance. It is a necessary work and is a very important scholarly intervention about a rather neglected aspect of the history and present production of music in the city.

For the sake of heaviness,Brian Slagel,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19722058W,/authors/OL7526530A/Brian_Slagel,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 176,"""For The Sake Of Heaviness is an inside look at how Slagel built Metal Blade from a one-man operation in his mom's non-air-conditioned garage to the preeminent international home of heavy music that it is today. The book recounts the early beginning of a metal-obsessed Southern California kid who launched a fanzine and landed a record store job, before cobbling together what he assumed would be a one-off compilation of fledgling bands from the L.A. scene. Released in 1982, the Metal Massacre LP included the debut recordings of local groups such as Steeler, Malice, Ratt, and Metallica. For The Sake Of Heaviness pulls back the curtain to reveal the definitive look at how Metal Blade began, what they've accomplished, and where they're going. Slagel reveals the early advice he gave that helped guide Mötley Crüe's career; how he helped Metallica replace their bassist--twice; his detailed work on Thin Lizzy and Alice Cooper reissues; his behind-the-scenes role in the careers of Slayer, Gwar, Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Goo Goo Dolls, and Lamb of God; and his unlikely ventures with kindred metal heads--from hockey star Ken Baumgartner, to celebrity chef Chris Santos, to The Howard Stern Show's Richard Christy, to comedians Jim Florentine, Don Jamieson and Jim Breuer""--Publisher's description.

Fast and frenetic in their leather jackets and torn jeans, the Ramones gave voice to the disaffected youth of the seventies and eighties, influenced countless bands, and inspired the counterculture for decades to come. Born Jeffry Hyman of Queens, New York, Joey Ramone was the quirky, extraordinary lead singer and cofounder of the band. Hiding his face behind signature sunglasses and a mop of dark hair, he helped define punk's early image, and his two-decade-plus tenure as the Ramones' front man made him unforgettable. Told by Joey's brother, Mickey Leigh, here is an intimate look at the turbulent life of one of America's greatest--and unlikeliest--music icons.--From publisher description.

He's not just the music's namesake ('the devil's music'), but a shadowy presence who haunts an imagined Mississippi crossroads where, it is claimed, Delta bluesman Robert Johnson traded away his soul in exchange for extraordinary prowess on the guitar. Yet, as scholar and musician Adam Gussow argues, there is much more to the story of the devil and the blues than these cliched understandings. Gussow takes the full measure of the devil's presence. Working from original transcriptions of more than 125 recordings released during the past ninety years, Gussow explores the varied uses to which black southern blues people have put this trouble-sowing, love-wrecking, but also empowering figure. The book culminates with a reinterpretation of Johnson's music and a investigation of the way in which the citizens of Clarksdale, Mississippi, managed to rebrand a commercial hub as ""the crossroads"" in 1999, claiming Johnson and the devil as their own."" -- Provided by the publisher.

Fueron muchos los obstáculos a vencer y las luchas a librar que el ambiente cultural del país de ese momento puso en el camino y en las voluntades de todos aquellos jóvenes y de su líder, para hacer creíble y posible el desarrollo de un modelo funcional y dinámico de enseñanza y difusión de la música en toda la sociedad venezolana a través de la Orquesta Nacional Juvenil de Venezuela. La obra contiene anécdotas de los primeros ensayos, conciertos, giras, triunfos internacionales y seminarios; un paseo por escenarios políticos del país que permite conocer las posiciones y opiniones de diversas personalidades, pertenecientes a distintos ámbitos del quehacer nacional, sobre la ""locura de Abreu"", así como los traviesos y originales cuentos del autor. Los hechos son narrados cronológicamente, con detalles claros y precisos que ilustran verazmente momentos y situaciones (algunas descritas con extraordinario humor venezolano) de una realidad histórica dentro de un proceso socio-cultural único y ejemplarizante, que se conoce hoy en el mundo como El Sistema.""--Publisher description.

He takes aim at the ‘Irish-American’ repertoire of songs that comprise Catholic music in this country, and assails other less felicitous liturgical practices in vogue since Vatican II, such as applauding during Mass. ‘Liturgical post-modernism,’ according to Day, has resulted in noisy and forced participation from the laity, and encourages a church-wide narcissism that is a serious threat to individuals as well as the institution. No mere nay-sayer, Day makes positive suggestions for nurturing the latent vitality he perceives in the American Catholic community. This is an informative, insightful and entertaining critique.” —Publishers Weekly.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Before being declared a national treasure by President Ronald Reagan, Williams would chart eighteen gold and three platinum albums, headline at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for more than twenty years, and host an enormously popular weekly television variety show whose Christmas specials still occupy a tender spot in every baby boomer's heart.Williams knew everybody who was anybody during his seven remarkable decades in show business (including Judy Garland, John Huston, Jack Lemmon, John Lennon, Elton John, Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and Barbra Streisand, among others) and was a close friend of Bobby Kennedy for many years, and he shares memories of them all in Moon River and Me. His millions of fans guarantee a huge audience for the autobiography of the plush baritone who— at the age of eighty-one—still draws thousands of fans to his Moon River Theater in Branson, Missouri.

Joni on Joni,Joni Mitchell,music,First published in 2018,/works/OL19764878W,/authors/OL396367A/Joni_Mitchell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 398,"""Few artists of the 20th century are as intriguing as Joni Mitchell. She was a solidly middle-class, buttoned-up bohemian; an anti-feminist who loved men but scorned free love; a female warrior taking on the male music establishment. She was both the party girl with torn stockings and the sensitive poet. She often said she would be criticized for staying the same or changing, so why not take the less boring option? Her earthy, poetic lyrics (the geese in chevron flight in Urge for Going), the phrases that are now part of the culture (They paved paradise, put up a parking lot), and the unusual melodic intervals traced by that lissome voice earned her the status of a pop legend. Fearless experimentation ensured that she will also be seen as one of the most important musicians of the 20th century. Joni on Joni is an authoritative, chronologically arranged anthology of some of Mitchell's most illuminating interviews, spanning the years 1966 to 2014. Many are revealing pieces from her early years in Canada and Detroit, and influential articles such as Cameron Crowe's Rolling Stone piece appear. Interspersed throughout the book are key quotes from dozens of additional Q&As. Together, this material paints a revealing picture of the artist--bragging and scornful, philosophical and deep, but also a beguiling flirt""--Provided by publisher.

North Carolina musicians pioneered and mastered the genres of old-time and bluegrass music. Doc Watson played mountain fiddle tunes on guitar. He emerged as the father of flatpicking and forever changed the role of the guitar in American music. Charlie Poole created techniques that eventually defined bluegrass, and folks around the state heard his banjo on some of the most important old-time recordings. Rising star Rhiannon Giddens keeps the music alive today through new interpretations of classic old-time and bluegrass songs. Elizabeth Carlson profiles these and other masters of string music in this fascinating record of North Carolina s musical past, present and future.""  Includes primary source materials.

Then he was recruited by two of his successful musician friends to form a band that became Semisonic.  Who could forget the smash single ""Closing Time,"" a runaway hit in 1998 that thrust Jake and his bandmates into the international spotlight and helped them sell over two million albums worldwide?  But along the road to fame and success came bewilderment and personal chaos: How will we ever get a record deal?  Which record company is the best?  The worst?  Do I really have to wear these ridiculous boots?  Why isn't radio playing our song? What if I have a panic attack right here on stage? What should I write on this fan's CD?  Am I famous?  Why isn't the video director getting more shots of me?  Did I say the wrong thing during that interview?  Help!So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star is a telling and witty look at what happens just before and during one's time in the spotlight.  Jake takes readers on a step-by-step journey of his evolution from fledgling drummer to globetrotting performer and proves to be the perfect guide--feisty and humbled--to the inner workings of the music industry and instant celebrity.  So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star speaks to all of us who dream again and again of rock superstardom and shows how one kid can go from picking up a pair of drumsticks to picking up a platinum record.

Restaging past exhibitions and remixing examples from multiple bodies of work in a fresh narrative, the artist presents his bold output in a sumptuous environment that transforms the museum space. Carpeted and tiled floors, brightly painted walls, and neon lighting create a milieu for the art that is part suburban living room, part plush strip club. Full page illustrations of the visually intoxicating exhibition form the centerpiece of this volume are complemented by stills from the artist's electrifying videos as well as reproductions of his formally rigorous, brightly colored mashups of consumer objects and appropriated images. Two essays illuminate Da Corte's engagement with film, animation, and appropriation while exploring the personal, cultural, and political themes that run through the work. The book provides a glimpse of the prolific artist's breadth while capturing the sensory impact of Da Corte's simultaneously seductive and unsettling worlds.

Europa statt. Die Publikation erscheint begleitend zur Ausstellung. Samson Young studierte Musik, Philosophie und Gender Studies an der Universität von Sydney und hat einen Doktor in Komposition in Princeton gemacht. Aus dieser audio-basierten Perspektive entwirft er nicht nur Musik sondern auch Installationen, Performances, Zeichnungen, Walks und Filme. Seine musikalisch-skulpturalen Arbeiten haben sehr oft einen konkreten historischen Bezug und setzen sich mit Orten des Konflikts auseinander. Hinter jedem seiner Projekte steht ein hoher Aufwand an Recherche und Feldforschung. Sounds und Musik werden dabei als Vehikel für die Aufarbeitung und Darstellung historischer Ereignisse genutzt, sind aber zugleich der Kern einer ästhetischen Erfahrung, die für sich allein steht und keine weiteren Erklärungen benötigt.0Exhibition: Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany (17.12.2016-05.03.2017).

Over that time, popular music has transformed the world in which we live. Its rhythms have influenced how we walk down the street, how we face ourselves in the mirror, and how we handle the outside world in our daily conversations and encounters. It has influenced our morals and social mores; it has transformed our attitudes towards race and gender, religion and politics. From the beginning of recording, when a musical performance could be preserved for the first time, to the digital age, when all of recorded music is only a mouse-click away; from the straitlaced ballads of the Victorian era and the 'coon songs' that shocked America in the early twentieth century to gangsta rap, death metal and the multiple strands of modern dance music: Peter Doggett takes us on a rollercoaster ride through the history of music. Within a narrative full of anecdotes and characters, Electric Shock mixes musical critique with wider social and cultural history and shows how revolutionary changes in technology have turned popular music into the lifeblood of the modern world.

This glorious treasury is the definitive annotated edition of all fourteen of their operas. From the partially lost work Thespis, the first collaboration between W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, through the triumphant comic romps The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado, to lesser-performed gems such as the fanciful The Sorcerer and the acerbic lampoon Patience, Gilbert's libretti are collected here in their most accurate and faithful form. There is a fascinating commentary on each work, telling the extraordinary stories behind the inspiration for the opera and its performance history, and giving plot summaries and original cast lists.

Love him or hate him, 30 years after the release of the Sex Pistols' first record, John Lydon—the man who was the focal point of the British punk movement—is impossible to ignore when discussing the history of rock. Was the Sex Pistols' album Never Mind the Bollocks the one true masterpiece of punk's first wave? How did the Pistols influence American punk? How does Lydon's post-Pistols work in PIL compare in influence and artistry? Contributors delve into these questions and more in this fitting tribute to an underdog who went on to become an antihero to millions.

Twelve-tone tonality,George Perle,music,First published in 1977,/works/OL2916380W,/authors/OL444203A/George_Perle,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1114124M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  University of California Press|Language English|Pages 256,"The challenge, in twentieth-century music, to the normative status of triadic tonality is one of the most far-reaching and extreme revolutions that the history of music has known. In his classic work, Twelve-Tone Tonality, George Perle argues that the seemingly disparate styles of post-triadic music in fact share common structural elements. According to Perle, these elements collectively imply a new tonality as ""natural"" and coherent as the major-minor tonality that was the basis of a common musical language in the past. His book describes the foundational assumptions of this post-diatonic tonality and illustrates its compositional functions with numerous musical examples. The second edition of Twelve-Tone Tonality is enlarged by eleven new chapters. Some of these are ""postscripts"" to earlier chapters, clarifying, elucidating, and expanding upon concepts discussed in the original edition. Others discuss new developments in the theory and practice of twelve-tone tonality, including voice-leading implications of the system and dissonance treatment. Errors discovered in the original edition have been corrected. - Jacket flap.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Her dream is to be the chief conductor of one of the great orchestras: even the heartbreaking round of conducting competitions has not broken her spirit. And when she loses at an all-important contest in Paris, she is consoled by the glowing praise of the world-famous Czech conductor Alexander Stoltze and his brilliant young protégé Karel Haken.  Back in Edinburgh, Juliet and her equally-ambitious flatmates immerse themselves in the music they love - so they are there for Juliet when Karel crosses her path once more and leaves her with a broken heart. Then, at last, she gets her chance, as assistant conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra. She will somehow have to make her name in a make-or-break year, while overcoming a jealous rival and working for the man she once thought she could love.

Under the stadium lights a 30,000-strong crowd wait for Metallica's first ever show in the Middle East. Many have faced untold violence, but for tonight, nothing else matters. This is the story of that crowd. Of the people and the music they make in the backrooms of shabby houses in Beirut and Qatif, Damascus and Cairo. Of illegal shows in Tehran and Riyadh. Of songs that ousted a dictator in Egypt. Of exiles that have ended in glory and in blood. Journalist and heavy metal fan Orlando Crowcroft spent six years in the midst of the rock, hip hop and metal scenes of the Middle East. Rock in  a Hard Place is a different voice, one that is at odds with the Middle East of extremism, war and ISIS. It is a voice recognisable to anyone who has ever turned up an amp to drown out the din of the everyday, a voice that may help unite us when we need it most.""

Maestros and their music,John Mauceri,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19725890W,/authors/OL7528482A/John_Mauceri,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27356742M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 262,"John Mauceri brings a lifetime of experience to bear in an unprecedented, hugely informative, consistently entertaining exploration of his profession, rich with anecdotes from decades of working alongside the greatest names of the music world. With candor and humor, Mauceri makes clear that conducting is itself a composition: of legacy and tradition, techniques handed down from master to apprentice--and more than a trace of ineffable magic. He reveals how conductors approach a piece of music (a calculated combination of personal interpretation, imagination, and insight into the composer's intent); what it takes to communicate solely through gesture, with sometimes hundreds of performers at once; and the occasionally glamorous, often challenging life of the itinerant maestro. Mauceri, who worked closely with Leonard Bernstein for eighteen years, studied with Leopold Stokowski, and was on the faculty of Yale University for fifteen years, is the perfect guide to the allure and theater, passion and drudgery, rivalries and relationships of the conducting life.

Contemporary humanity is shaped in neoliberal terms, where being human means being viable in a capitalist marketplace that favors whiteness, masculinity, heterosexuality, and fixed gender identities. But musicians from Nicki Minaj to Future to Rae Sremmurd deploy queerness and sonic blackness as they imagine different ways of being human. Building on the work of Sylvia Wynter, Alexander Weheliye, Lester Spence, LH Stallings, and a broad swath of queer and critical race theory, Posthuman Rap turns an ear especially toward hip hop that is often read as apolitical in order to hear its posthuman possibilities, its construction of a humanity that is blacker, queerer, more feminine than the norm [Publisher description]   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The event set off a media frenzy as observers from around the world sought to understand what led this rock star out of the darkness and into the light.Now, in this courageous memoir, Head talks for the first time about his shocking embrace of God and the tumultuous decade that led him into the arms of Jesus Christ. Offering a backstage pass to his time with Korn, Head tells the inside story of his years in the band and explains how his rock star lifestyle resulted in an all-consuming addiction to methamphetamines. Writing openly about the tour bus mayhem of Ozzfest and The Family Values tour, he provides a candid look at how the routine of recording, traveling, and partying placed him in a cycle of addiction that he could not break on his own.Speaking honestly about his addiction, Head details his struggles with the drug that ultimately led him to seek a higher power. Despite his numerous attempts to free himself from meth, nothing—not even the birth of his daughter—could spur him to kick it for good. Here Head addresses how, with the help of God, he emerged from his dangerous lifestyle and found a path that was not only right for his daughter, it was right for him. Discussing the chaotic end to his time in Korn and how his newfound faith has influenced his relationship with his daughter, his life, and his music, Head describes the challenging but rewarding events of the last two years, exposing the truth about how his moments of doubt and his hardships have only deepened his faith.Candid, compelling, and inspirational, Save Me from Myself is a rock 'n' roll journey unlike any other.

Bach's music and its towering presence in our cultural memory have long affected how people hear his works. In his own time, however, Bach stood as just another figure among a number of composers, many of them more popular with the music-loving public. Eschewing the great composer style of music history, Andrew Talle takes us on a journey that looks at how ordinary people made music in Bach's Germany. Talle focuses in particular on the culture of keyboard playing as lived in public and private. As he ranges through a wealth of documents, instruments, diaries, account ledgers, and works of art, Talle brings a fascinating cast of characters to life. These individuals--amateur and professional performers, patrons, instrument builders, and listeners--inhabited a lost world, and Talle's deft expertise teases out the diverse roles music played in their lives and in their relationships with one another. At the same time, his nuanced recreation of keyboard playing's social milieu illuminates the era's reception of Bach's immortal works.""--Jacket.

Hess,music,First published in 2011,/works/OL16489427W?edition=ia%3Alearninginmusica0000hess,/authors/OL6714159A/Lisa_M._Hess,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25189412M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Pickwick Publications|Language English|Pages 236,"Learning in a Musical Key examines the multidimensional problem of the relationship between music and theological education. Lisa Hess argues that, in a delightful and baffling way, musical learning has the potential to significantly alter and inform our conception of the nature and process of theological learning. In exploring this exciting intersection of musical learning and theological training, Hess asks two probing questions. First, What does learning from music in a performative mode require? Classical modes of theological education often founder on a dichotomy between theologically musical and educational discourses. It is extremely difficult for many to see how the perceivedly nonmusical learn from music. Is musicality a universally human potential? In exploring this question Hess turns to the music-learning theory of Edwin Gordon, which explores music's unique mode of teaching/learning, its primarily aural-oral mode. This challenge leads to the study's second question: How does a theologian, in the disciplinary sense, integrate a performative mode into critical discourse? Tracking the critical movements of this problem, Hess provides an inherited, transformational logic as a feasible path for integrating a performative mode into multidimensional learning. This approach emerges as a distinctly relational, embodied, multidimensional, and non-correlational performative-mode theology that breaks new ground in the contemporary theological landscape. As an implicitly trinitarian method, rooted in the relationality of God, this non-correlational method offers a practical theological contribution to the discipline of Christian spirituality, newly claimed here as a discipline of transformative teaching/learning through the highly contextualized and self-implicated scholar into relationally formed communities, and ultimately into the world.

The Battle Hymn of the Republic,John Stauffer,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL16806167W?edition=ia%3Abattlehymnofrepu0000stau,/authors/OL5096701A/John_Stauffer,//archive.org/services/img/battlehymnofrepu0000stau,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English,"It was sung at Ronald Reagan's funeral, and adopted with new lyrics by labor radicals. John Updike quoted it in the title of one of his novels, and George W. Bush had it performed at the memorial service in the National Cathedral for victims of September 11, 2001. Perhaps no other song has held such a profoundly significant -- and contradictory -- place in America's history and cultural memory than the ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" In this sweeping study, John Stauffer and Benjamin Soskis show how this Civil War tune has become an anthem for cause after radically different cause. The song originated in antebellum revivalism, with the melody of the camp-meeting favorite, ""Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us."" Union soldiers in the Civil War then turned it into ""John Brown's Body."" Julia Ward Howe, uncomfortable with Brown's violence and militancy, wrote the words we know today. Using intense apocalyptic and millenarian imagery, she captured the popular enthusiasm of the time, the sense of a climactic battle between good and evil; yet she made no reference to a particular time or place, allowing it to be exported or adapted to new conflicts, including Reconstruction, sectional reconciliation, imperialism, progressive reform, labor radicalism, civil rights movements, and social conservatism. And yet the memory of the song's original role in bloody and divisive Civil War scuttled an attempt to make it the national anthem. The Daughters of the Confederacy held a contest for new lyrics, but admitted that none of the entries measured up to the power of the original. ""The Battle Hymn"" has long helped to express what we mean when we talk about sacrifice, about the importance of fighting -- in battles both real and allegorical -- for the values America represents. It conjures up and confirms some of our most profound conceptions of national identity and purpose. And yet, as Stauffer and Soskis note, the popularity of the song has not relieved it of the tensions present at its birth -- tensions between unity and discord, and between the glories and the perils of righteous enthusiasm. If anything, those tensions became more profound. By following this thread through the tapestry of American history, The Battle Hymn of the Republic illuminates the fractures and contradictions that underlie the story of our nation. - Publisher.

H. Clarke & co.,              O. Ditson & co.|Language English|Pages 128","The author, William Horatio Clarke has been called ""America's Organ Architect"" and the book he wrote aims to provide the reader with a brief rendering of the inner-workings of the pipe organ in America in the mid 19th century.     Clarke was building pipe organs at the time of writing of his book and while some of his simplest and smallest instruments survive to this day (less than 10?) some of his lugubrious designs were disasters--I suspect he gained tremendous confidence in his ability to persuade people to buy organs built to his specification and taste and suffered the misfortune associated with those who misinterpret their success with people and committees to such an extent they believe they can build great pipe organs with comparatively little hands-on, practical, wood chips in your face, experience that all great organbuilders share.    A good read...but not useful for any practical purpose aside from the study of 'things' historic.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whether it be Procul Harum going to court to decide who really wrote 'Whiter Shade of Pale' or the Moody Blues wanting their fair share of 'Nights of White Satin', when the song-credits get divvied up, a parting of the ways citing 'musical differences' is almost inevitable. So here are some choice examples of poplore held up to the light, some familiar to music fans others not, designed to prove that Dylan knew of what he wrote when he suggested, 'Money doesn't talk, it swears'.

This book takes children's development as its basis and works towards building a music pedagogy within early years practice. A readiness to listen, observe and reflect is central to the practice which threads through the book.Based on the authors' extensive experience and drawing on that of other teachers and researchers, lots of well-tried, practical ideas show how teachers, parents and carers can help children fulfil their music potential. Sample activities model ways of working with children and have been written in such a way that they can be substituted with other material and adapted for further use. Earlier and later stages of learning and progression are described as a basis for matching activities with children's learning needs, as well as a companion book, Primary Music: Later Years.

With insight and humor, Glenn Kurtz takes us from his first lessons at a small Long Island guitar school at the age of eight, to a national television appearance backing jazz legend Dizzy Gillespie, to his acceptance at the elite New England Conservatory of Music. He makes bittersweet and vivid a young man’s struggle to forge an artist’s life—and to become the next Segovia. And we see him after graduation, pursuing a solo career in Vienna but realizing that he has neither the ego nor the talent required to succeed at the upper reaches of the world of classical guitar—and giving up the instrument, and his dream, entirely.  Or so he thought. For, returning to the guitar, Kurtz weaves into the larger narrative the rich experience of a single practice session, demonstrating how practicing—the rigor, attention, and commitment it requires—becomes its own reward, an almost spiritual experience that redefines the meaning of “success.” Along the way, he traces the evolution of the guitar and reminds us why it has retained its singular popularity through the ages.  Complete with a guide to selected musical recordings and methods, Practicing takes us on a revelatory, inspiring journey: a love affair with music.

Wiley & Sons|Language English,"By the early nineties, singer-songwriter and former Blake Babies member Juliana Hatfield's solo career was taking off: She was on the cover of Spin and Sassy. Ben Stiller directed the video for her song ""Spin the Bottle"" from the Reality Bites film soundtrack. Then, after canceling a European tour to treat severe depression and failing to produce another ""hit,"" she spent a decade releasing well reviewed albums on indie labels and performing in ever-smaller clubs. A few years ago, she found herself reading the New Yorker on a filthy couch in the tiny dressing room of a punk club and asked, ""Why am I still doing this?"" By turns wryly funny and woundingly sincere, When I Grow Up takes you behind the scenes of rock life as Hatfield recounts her best and worst days, the origins of her songs, the source of her woes, and her quest to find a new purpose in life.

Para esta edición se han utilizado, entre otras, las obras: ""Canciones y Recuerdos"" de Jorge Añez, ""Lo que Cuentan las Canciones"" de Hernán Restrepo Duque, ""Compositores Colombianos"" deHeriberto Zapata Cuenca,""Antología Artística Colombiana"" de José I, Pinilla Aguilar, ""Mi música Argentina"" de Fernel Ocampo Muñera, ""...Autores y Compositores Colombianos"" de Lubín Enrique Mazuera Millán, ""Historia de un hombre que se convirtió en símbolo"" de Octavio Marulanda y ""Su artista favorito"" de Carlos Serna Serna.    La falta de fuentes de información impidió, lógicamente, que en esta obra aparecieran datos biográficos de muy importantes compositores, conjuntos y cantantes. Esta involuntaria omisión se subsanará en publicaciones posteriores, o en la medida en que la investigación sea más expedita.    La utilización de esta obra se ha facilitado no sólo con un índice alfabético por títulos, sino también por la distribución del material en cuatro partes:    RESEÑAS BIOGRAFICAS    Autores, compositores e intérpretes colombianos.    Conjuntos colombianos.    Autores, compositores e intérpretes extranjeros.    Conjuntos extranjeros.    AYER EN MIS CANCIONES    Colombia en mis canciones.    Latinoamérica en mis canciones.    HOY EN MIS CANCIONES    Canciones modernas    LA GUITARRA EN MIS CANCIONES    Los asteriscos que aparecen después de autores, compositores e intérpretes en la sección de canciones, indican que tienen reseña biográfica en la primera parte de esta obra.

Author and veteran piano instructor Deborah Rambo Sinn tackles a different interpretive principle, explaining clearly, for example, how to play effective ornaments and rubatos. As a whole, the book helps pianists understand concrete ways to apply interpretive concepts to their own playing and gives teachers practical ways to teach interpretation to their students. The book is illustrated with over 200 repertoire excerpts and supplemented by a companion website with over 100 audio recordings. Playing Beyond the Notes is essential reading for all performing pianists, independent piano teachers, and piano pedagogy students. - Publisher.

Additional material such as audio and video can be viewed only in Adobe® Digital Editions on Mac or PC.The autobiography of two inspirational fiftysomething rockers, still heroically following their dream after thirty years on the road.At fourteen, Toronto school friends Steve 'Lips' Kudlow and Robb Reiner made a pact to rock together forever. Forming their band 'Anvil' they went on to become the 'demi-gods of Canadian metal', releasing one of the heaviest albums in metal history, 1982's Metal on Metal. The album influenced a musical generation including the world-dominating bands Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax, all of whom went on to sell millions of records. Anvil's career would take a different path, however, as they slipped straight into obscurity...Almost thirty years later Lips and Robb, our unlikely musical heroes, are still chasing their dream. Anvil! The Story of Anvil, their autobiography, follows the ups and down of their career and their volatile friendship (which has now spanned almost four decades), reveals their dedication and unadulterated passion for their music, and carries us along on their last-ditch quest for fame and fortune. Based on Sacha Gervasi's award-winning film of the same name, and published to coincide with its worldwide release, this hilarious yet poignant book reminds us that if you believe in yourself, stick by your friends and never give up, you really can make your dreams come true. You cannot fail to be moved by this story. Anvil rock!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For many, in fact, the Psalms are the richest part of the Old Testament. Derek Kidner provides a fresh and penetrating guide to Psalms 1-72. He analyzes each psalm in depth, comments on interpretive questions and brings out the universal relevance of the texts. He also gives special help on the psalmists' cries for vengeance.

And that it is only the South Side of Chicago, with its history and culture and institutions that could have sent an African American, in this day and age, to the White House. 'Obama Music' is a mixture of anecdotes about her own growing up in one of America's most formidable Black communities, mixed in with observations on the origins and progress of the music of the South Side: gospel, blues, soul and jazz, and Barack and Michelle Obama's relation to the sound of their community. All of this is woven in with history ranging from the Great Migration at the end of World War One, to the and of the 60's, an era Obama himself has stated that he feels close to. This is not a conventional history book, nor a reporter-on-the campaign-trail account. 'Obama Music' is one African American woman's account of watching, from the other side of the ocean, history being made, a history rooted in the community of her birth, right in her own home town. Small, opinionated, personal, anecdotal and full of music and insights, this book can sit alongside the more heavyweight tomes as a footnote to the phenomenon that is Obama Music.

Voice of the Rural,Alessandra Ciucci,music,First published in 2022,/works/OL26348323W,/authors/OL9932760A/Alessandra_Ciucci,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  University of Chicago Press|Language English|Pages 241,"A moving portrait of the contemporary experiences of migrant Moroccan men. Umbria is known to most Americans for its picturesque rolling hills and medieval villages, but to the many migrant Moroccan men who travel there, Umbria is better known for the tobacco fields, construction sites, small industries, and the outdoor weekly markets where they work. Marginalized and far from their homes, these men turn to Moroccan traditions of music and poetry that evoke the countryside they have left-- l-'arubiya, or the rural. In this book, Alessandra Ciucci takes us inside the lives of Moroccan workers, unpacking the way they share a particular musical style of the rural to create a sense of home and belonging in a foreign and inhospitable nation. Along the way, she uncovers how this culture of belonging is not just the product of the struggles of migration, but also tied to the reclamation of a noble and virtuous masculine identity that is inaccessible to Moroccan migrants in Italy. The Voice of the Rural allows us to understand the contemporary experiences of migrant Moroccan men by examining their imagined relationship to the rural through sound, shedding new light on the urgent issues of migration and belonging.

As King hunts for two long-lost virtuosos--one of whom may have committed a murder--he also tells the story of the Roma people who pioneered Epirotic folk music and their descendants who continue the tradition today. King discovers clues to his most profound questions about the function of music in the history of humanity: What is the relationship between music and language? Why do we organize sound as music? Is music superfluous, a mere form of entertainment, or could it be a tool for survival? King's journey becomes an investigation into song and dance's role as a means of spiritual healing--and what that may reveal about music's evolutionary origins"" -- Amazon.com.

What is it about certain abstract patterns of sound that makes us want to dance?  How can songs have deep emotional power despite lyrics that are simple and trite?  We tend to think of the arts as luxuries rather than necessities, and as inventions of society rather than evolution.  Yet the origin of musical ability was a turning point in the evolution of modern humans.  Every culture, without exception, has some form of music.  Is this really a luxury or does it answer some basic biological need?  If so, what?  In Beethoven's Anvil, William Benzon takes up the fascinating and unexplored link between music and the brain.   Among early humans, he says, there was no distinction between music, dance, ritual and religion—they were all part of the same activity, and this activity used every part of the conscious brain.  Language,  movement, vision, emotion, hearing, touch and social interaction were all involved.  In fact, Benzon argues, music is necessary precisely because it engages so many different parts of the brain.  It literally keeps the brain in tune with itself and with the brains of others.  The ultimate form of musical experience is that feeling of oneness with a larger entity that we identify as transcendent religious experience.  We feel this way because that’s precisely what the brain is doing:  becoming one with a larger unit, the human tribe.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It delves into the artist's conceptualization of the music-audience nexus along with his motivation for adopting an interactive manner that emerges through a verbal interaction between performer and listener during the concert performances. Using specific concert performances given in Malatya in Turkey, this book presents a detailed demonstration of such a space as a learning medium, and interprets its pedagogical meaning from both the artist's and the audience's perspectives.

Rolling Stone ranked the Ramones at #26 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time."" They received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. And Marky Ramone played a major part in this success--his ""blitzkrieg"" style of drumming drove the sound the Ramones pioneered. Now, fans can get the inside story. Before he joined the Ramones, Marc Bell was already a name in the New York music scene. But when he joined three other tough misfits, he became Marky Ramone, and the rhythm that came to epitomize punk was born. Having outlived his bandmates, Marky is the only person who can share the secrets and stories of the Ramones' improbable rise from obtuse beginnings to induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But it wasn't all good times and hit songs, and Marky doesn't shy away from discussing his own struggles, including the addiction to alcohol that led him to be temporarily kicked out of the band. From the cult film Rock 'n' Roll High School through ""I Wanna Be Sedated"" through his own struggle with alcoholism, Marky Ramone sets the record straight, painting an unflinching picture of the dysfunction behind the band that changed a generation. With exclusive behind-the-scenes photos, Punk Rock Blitzkrieg is both a cultural history of punk and a stirring story that millions of fans have been waiting for""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Musica e diritto dal fonogramma al digitale,Guerino Pagano,music,First published in 2005,/works/OL12839607W,/authors/OL5788190A/Guerino_Pagano,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  F. Angeli|Language Italian|Pages 318,"L’autore, dal greco auxano, “far crescere”, e dal latino augere, “accrescere”, è colui che prolunga nel tempo quel fiat, iniziato e mai finito, di trasformazioni volte al miglioramento, al progresso, al passaggio dall’imperfetto al sempre più perfetto. Per questo il diritto d’autore è il più antico, reale, assoluto. È il diritto di chi “partorisce” le idee (“paternità” o “maternità” dell’opera?). È il diritto più spirituale: lo si acquista con la creazione intellettuale di un’opera originale. Oggi è la qualità più richiesta dal mercato e la presuppongono ricerca e sperimentazione tecnica, scientifica, artistica. Partendo dai fondamenti del diritto d’autore, il libro ripercorre le principali norme che disciplinano la materia, privilegiando l’aspetto morale attraverso la lettura della Legge 22 aprile 1941 n. 633 “Protezione del diritto d’autore e di altri diritti connessi al suo esercizio”, e successive modificazioni. Speciale attenzione è rivolta all’analisi delle nuove tecnologie, e, più specificamente, alla tutela delle opere in rete. Percorrendo la legislazione dello spettacolo, l’autrice arriva a considerare i lineamenti della nuova società dell’informazione e, attraverso una lettura delle direttive 2000/31/CE, 2004/48/CE e del Decreto Legislativo 16 marzo 2006, n. 140, mette in luce quel comparto del diritto entrato in crisi con la rivoluzione informatica. Il testo si rivela utile strumento per enti, istituzioni, associazioni di categoria, produttori, artisti, interpreti ed esecutori, attori, operatori del diritto, studenti, e, in generale, per tutti coloro che intendono proteggere le loro opere. La parte conclusiva è arricchita da un’ulteriore riflessione sul tema del diritto d’autore e della legislazione afferente con una serie di interviste a esponenti di mondi che alla tutela della creatività devono la loro crescita, il loro sviluppo, la loro stessa ragion d’essere (Rosetta Berardi, Maria Giovanna Maioli Loperfido, Mara Maionchi, Dacia Maraini, Cristina Mazzavillani Muti, Ottavia    Piccolo, Jo Squillo, Alessandra Zagatti).

After days of ""craying""--""that sorrow-laden blend of crying and praying delivered in perfect pitch by those in mourning""--Ferentz happened upon Stevie Wonder's 1976 classic double album Songs in the Key of Life. Listening to it anew was a healing, spiritual trip down memory lane, helping him to come to terms with his breakup and reflect on how songs in general have been linked to his life.In this book, Ferentz invites us to get cozy and listen as he hits PLAY on meaningful tracks from Wonder and others, including Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, LL Cool J, Beenie Man, Sheryl Crow, Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, and Black Sabbath. He recalls:How the fusion of rock and rap in the breakthrough Run-D.M.C./Aerosmith video ""Walk This Way"" helped to change an adolescent Ferentz from outcast to authority figureHow Michael Jackson's Thriller brought back a traumatic childhood experienceHow Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"" speaks to the tension between his Christian beliefs and his need to rip it up in clubs as a hip-hop headIn the tradition of Nick Hornby's Songbook¸ these words paint a portrait of a life framed by sounds, allowing all of us to think about what songs have been key in our own lives.

Die musikkulturelle Erfahrungswelt Jugendlicher: Ein kulturwissenschaftlicher Deutungsansatz und seine musikpädagogische Relevanz,Martina Claus-Bachmann,music,First published in 2005,/works/OL2303060W,/authors/OL304037A/Martina_Claus-Bachmann,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21243126M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  ulme-mini-verlag|Language German|Pages 300,"Ziel der Untersuchung ist die Darstellung von Kultur als dynamischem, autopoietischem, d.h. in prozesshaftem Austausch mit dem Kulturträger existierenden System. Diese Perspektive wird mit den Ergebnissen einer quantitativen und qualitativen Analyse argumentativ belegt und aus einer emischen (hier als Feldforschung innerhalb von Schulklassen oder Jugendgruppen) konstruktivistischen Sichtweise heraus durch teilnehmende Beobachtung, Leitfadeninterviews mit jugendlichen Anhängern verschiedener Kultursysteme unter dem Dach der bundesdeutschen Gesellschaft und Songtexte kulturtragender Musiker erhärtet. Die Theoriekonstruktion schließt sich an die allgemeine geisteswissenschaftliche oder besser gesagt kulturwissenschaftliche Debatte um konstruktivistisches, systemisches und kognitionswissenschaftliches Denken an und überträgt unter Anwendung ethnographischer und -methodologischer Verfahren diese Ansätze zum ersten Mal auf eine Konzeption im Bereich der Musikpädagogik. Es ergeben sich weitreichende pädagogische Konsequenzen, denn bisherige Schwerpunkte des Musikunterrichts, wie sie sich in den Lehrplänen präsentieren, werden kritisch hinterfragt, da sie sich im wesentlichen als kanonische Konstrukte zur funktionalen Aufrechterhaltung eines bestimmten dominanten oder elitären Kultursystems und damit von Kulturzentrismus herausstellen und infolgedessen heterogene, zunächst unvertraut scheinende Kultursysteme marginalisieren. Dafür spricht auch die vorwiegend musikhistorisch geprägte Ausbildung des musikpädagogischen Nachwuchses. Vom Standpunkt einer globalen Kulturvernetzung und vom als Erziehungsziel propagierbaren Zielzustand einer globalen friedlichen Koexistenz kultureller Systeme ausgehend, kann die Einseitigkeit und Verabsolutierung musikpädagogischer (und allgemein kulturpädagogischer) Inhalte in verbindlich kanonisierter kulturzentristischer Form nicht mehr befriedigen. Es bedarf vielmehr flexibler ethnomusikologischer bzw. kulturwissenschaftlicher Methodenkompetenz und Vorkenntnisse beim Musikpädagogen, um kultureller Relativierung im globalen Rahmen gerecht zu werden. Deshalb sind auch rein pragmatisch im didaktischen Bereich Methoden zu entwickeln, die auf der Basis aktueller Kognitionsforschung der ganzheitlich-pluralen Verfassung unserer Gesellschaft und der darin lebenden Individuen mit ihren heterogenen kulturkonstruktivistischen Bedürfnissen gerecht werden. Dazu wird die Vision eines Multimedia-Arbeitsateliers mit Laptops und CD-ROM-Erfahrungsstationen vorgestellt, in welchem kulturelle und mediale Kompetenz sich gegenseitig bedingen und unterstützend entwickelt werden können, um subjektorientiert mit binnendifferenzierender Methodik, das Individuum lebensweltbezogen in einem sinnstiftenden Umgang mit Musik und ihrer kulturellen Bezogenheit zu unterstützen. Die CD-ROM ist eine unkommerziell zu verstehende Beigabe und enthält Multimedia--Materialien zur Veranschaulichung sowie alle mit dem Buchformat (B5/300 Seiten/CD-ROM) nicht kompatiblen Printmedien.

In this study of ritual and music, Robert L. Kendrick investigates the impact of the music used during the Paschal Triduum on European cultures during the mid-16th century, when devotional trends surrounding liturgical music were established; through the 17th century, which saw the diffusion of the repertory at the height of the Catholic Reformation; and finally into the early 18th century, when a change in aesthetics led to an eventual decline of its importance. By considering such issues as stylistic traditions, trends in scriptural exegesis, performance space, and customs of meditation and expression, Kendrick enables us to imagine the music in the places where it was performed [Publisher description].

The East Coast editor of Launch magazine, Randall is undoubtedly one of the many journalists eager to exclaim ""genius!"" again, but his biography of the Grammy winners is economical, restrained and unauthorized (band members ""respectfully declined"" Randall's requests to cooperate). After briefly reenacting the now mythic June 1997 concert at New York City's Irving Plaza, attended by rock's superstar aristocracy (Bono, Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, etc.), Randall smartly spends most of his narrative on the band's fascinating, decade-long conception in and around culturally barren Oxford, whose Radiohead landmarks he visited and lays out. Non- and neo-Anglophiles will especially appreciate Randall's definitions of British terms and background on the British music industry, music press and education system (all five musicians met at the all-male Abingdon School). As for the inevitable ""record critique"" chapters, Randall rarely throws in his two cents, preferring to sprinkle passages with the band's own pithy observations and recording-session anecdotes culled from magazine interviews. Exit music? Not quite, as Radiohead are pushing the boundaries of pop music (the new record is rumored to include Miles Davis and backwards singing). Because the book will be published right before the new album debuts, it will be nearly out of date by the time it hits bookstores. However, Randall's work will still serve as a reliable introduction to an ever-evolving band.From the Trade Paperback edition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In ""AEC,"" conductors John Yaffé and David Daniels have created a one-stop sourcebook for orchestras, opera companies, conductors, and librarians programming vocal excerpts (solos, ensembles, choruses, etc.) for concert performance. In this book, one finds detailed information on a vast repertoire of vocal excerpts commonly extracted from operas, operettas, musicals and oratorios — more than 1,750 excerpts from 450 parent works. Information includes basic historical details about the ""parent work"" as well as extract titles, subtitles, voice types, keys, durations, locations in the original work (with page numbers in both full scores and piano-vocal scores), and exact instrumentation. One especially valuable aspect of AEC is the listing of ""Sources,"" the publishers that make available the orchestral materials for just the excerpt being programmed (independent of the full parent work).  Conductors and orchestra librarians have, traditionally, had to first leaf through full scores, searching for one elusive three-minute aria after another, then consult multiple publishers' catalogues to compile crucial, and decisive, information on all the excerpts proposed for a concert or recording. In AEC, Yaffé and Daniels provide a single source in which to find that information. In many cases, the individual entries also include valuable ""insider information"" on common performance practice, including start- and stop-points, transpositions, and conventional cuts. Searching for repertoire is made easy with the detailed ""Title Index"" as well as appendices devoted to ensemble excerpts, categorized by personnel (e.g., duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, choruses) and by language (Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Russian).  This book is the ideal tool for the working conductor and orchestra librarian, as well as music program directors at colleges and conservatories, opera companies, and symphony orchestras.

I'm looking forward to sharing it with you.""  Mick Fleetwood has been a member of the ever-evolving Fleetwood Mac, one of the world's most successful and adored bands, for over four decades. Here he tells the full and candid story of his life as one of music's greatest drummers and band leaders, the co-founder of the deeply loved super group that bears his name along with his band mate and lifelong friend John McVie.  In this intimate portrait of a life lived in music, Fleetwood vividly recalls his upbringing tapping along to every song playing on the radio; his experiences as a musician in Sixties London and the earliest permutation of the band featuring Peter Green.  Play On sheds new light on Fleetwood Mac's raucous history, describing the highs and lows of being in the band that Fleetwood was determined to keep together. Here he reflects on the creation of landmark albums like Rumours and Tusk, the great loves of his life, and the many incredible and outrageous moments of recording, touring and living with Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood describes these moments with honesty and immediacy, taking us to the very heart of this multi-layered journey that has always been anchored in music.  Through it all, from intense love to plaintive heartaches, from collaborations to confrontations, it's been the drive to play on that has prevailed. Now, then, and always, it's Fleetwood Mac.

They inspired enslaved African Americans to risk their lives for the chance to be free. Wade in the Water celebrates these spirituals as an art form and as unique and powerful cultural expression. For those with little knowledge of the tradition, it provides a wealth of information. For those who know and love the spirituals, it offers a fresh perspective and an invitation to deeper understanding, spiritual transformation, and social renewal. - Back cover.  In ""Wade in the Water,"" Jones juxtaposes songs like ""Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child"" with historical accounts by former slaves of watching anguished mothers beg slave traders not to separate them from their children. He also decodes the language of resistance in songs used to signal uprisings or share information about escape routes. And he describes a music that blends Christian themes from the West with themes, rhythms and the call-and-response pattern from Africa, linking the slaves who created it to a tradition and identity that predated slavery. - Donna Bryson, Associated Press.

From her youth as the child of two singing teachers through her years at Juilliard, from her struggles to establish her career to her international success, The Inner Voice is a luminous, articulate, and candid self-portrait of a contemporary artist—and the most revelatory examination yet of the performing life.

"Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain, and America",Jonathan Gould,music,First published in 2007,/works/OL12277639W?edition=ia%3Acantbuymelovebea00goul,/authors/OL5367135A/Jonathan_Gould,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17906300M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Harmony Books|Language English,"Nearly twenty years in the making, Can't Buy Me Love is a masterful work of group biography, cultural history, and musical criticism. That the Beatles were an unprecedented phenomenon is a given. In Can't Buy Me Love, Jonathan Gould seeks to explain why, placing the Fab Four in the broad and tumultuous panorama of their time and place, rooting their story in the social context that girded both their rise and their demise. Beginning with their adolescence in Liverpool, Gould describes the seminal influences--from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry to The Goon Show and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland--that shaped the Beatles both as individuals and as a group. In addition to chronicling their growth as singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists, he highlights the advances in recording technology that made their sound both possible and unique, as well as the developments in television and radio that lent an explosive force to their popular success. With a musician's ear, Gould sensitively evokes the timeless appeal of the Lennon-McCartney collaboration and their emergence as one of the most creative and significant songwriting teams in history. And he sheds new light on the significance of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as rock's first concept album, down to its memorable cover art.Behind the scenes Gould explores the pivotal roles played by manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin, credits the influence on the Beatles' music of contemporaries like Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Ravi Shankar, and traces the gradual escalation of the fractious internal rivalries that led to the group's breakup after their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. Most significantly, by chronicling their revolutionary impact on popular culture during the 1960s, Can't Buy Me Love illuminates the Beatles as a charismatic phenomenon of international proportions, whose anarchic energy and unexpected import was derived from the historic shifts in fortune that transformed the relationship between Britain and America in the decades after World War II. From the Beats in America and the Angry Young Men in England to the shadow of the Profumo Affair and JFK's assassination, Gould captures the pulse of a time that made the Beatles possible--and even necessary. As seen through the prism of the Beatles and their music, an entire generation's experience comes astonishingly to life. Beautifully written, consistently insightful, and utterly original, Can't Buy Me Love is a landmark work about the Beatles, Britain, and America.From the Hardcover edition.

Since 1965, Pink Floyd haven been recording sonically experimental and philosophical music, selling more than 250 million records worldwide, including two of the best-selling albums of all time: The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. While much is known about this iconic group, few books provide a comprehensive history of their time in the studio. In Pink Floyd All the Songs, authors Margotin and Guesdon describe the origin of their nearly 200 released songs, details from the recording studio, what instruments were used, and behind-the-scenes stories of the tensions that helped drive the band. Organized chronologically by album, this massive, 544-page hardcover begins with their 1967 debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the only one recorded under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership; through the loss of Barrett and the addition of David Gilmour; to Richard Wright leaving the band in 1979 but returning; to Roger Waters leaving in 1985 and the albums recorded since his departure, including their 2014 farewell album, The Endless River, which was downloaded 12 million times on Spotify the week it was released. Packed with more than 500 photos, All the Songs is also filled with stories fans treasure, such as Waters working with engineer Alan Parsons to employ revolutionary recording techniques for The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios in 1972, or producer Bob's Ezrin's contribution in refining Water's original sprawling vision for The Wall.""--Publisher's description.

The composer of On the Town and West Side Story, chief conductor of the New York Philharmonic, television star, humanitarian, friend of the powerful and influential, and the life of every party, Leonard Bernstein was an enormous celebrity during one of the headiest periods of American cultural life, as well as the most protean musician in twentieth century America. But to his eldest daughter, Jamie, he was above all the man in the scratchy brown bathrobe who smelled of cigarettes; the jokester and compulsive teacher who enthused about Beethoven and the Beatles; the insomniac whose composing breaks at four a.m. involved spooning baby food out of the jar. He taught his daughter to love the world in all its beauty and complexity. In public and private, Lenny was larger than life. In Famous Father Girl, Bernstein mines the emotional depths of her childhood and invites us into her family's private world. A fantastic set of characters populates the Bernsteins' lives, including the Kennedys, Mike Nichols, John Lennon, Richard Avedon, Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, and Betty (Lauren) Bacall. An intoxicating tale, Famous Father Girl is an intimate meditation on a complex and sometimes troubled man, the family he raised, and the music he composed that became the soundtrack to their entwined lives. Deeply moving and often hilarious, Bernstein's beautifully written memoir is a great American story about one of the greatest Americans of the modern age.""--Dust jacket.

Where Immunity charted the dark alternative reality of an epic night out, Singularity explores the dissonance between dystopian urbanity and the green forest. It is a journey that returns to where it began - from the opening note of foreboding to the final sound of acceptance. Shaped by his experiences with meditation and trance states, the album flows seamlessly from rugged techno to transcendent choral music, from solo acoustic piano to psychedelic ambient.""--Amazon.com.

De tous métiers, milieux, cultures et origines. Je n'ai depuis cessé d'interroger l'humain, avec une curiosité inlassable pour la grandeur comme pour l'abjection de l'homme et un étonnement inchangé face à la diversité de ses compétences comme à l'étendue de ses impotences et à la profondeur parfois insondable de sa bêtise. Mais de toutes les activités humaines, c'est la création artistique, ses motifs et processus, et bien sûr l'œuvre qui en est le fruit, qui me semble toujours la plus bouleversante, la plus énigmatique. C'est elle ici que j'interroge. Je l'interroge par le biais de la littérature qui est le moyen de ma propre activité artistique, mais aussi celui dont je dispose pour entrer en intelligence avec les œuvres d'art, littéraires, musicales, picturales qui nous auront été léguées""--P.

Gypsies have for centuries been associated with criminality and dirt, but also with colour, magic and music. Gypsy music is popular around the world, and is performed at occasions that include weddings in Bulgaria, jazz shows in Paris and festivals in the USA. Performers like Taraf de Haidouks and the Boban Markovic Orkestar remain popular for their more traditional sounds, while groups such as Gogol Bordello have gained new audiences with experimental and hybridized forms.The Balkans is home to the world's largest Romani populations and a major site of gypsy music production. But just as the traditionally nomadic Roma have travelled globally, so has their music, and gypsy music styles have roots and associations beyond the Balkans, including Russian Romani guitar music, flamenco, gypsy jazz and the more recent forms of gypsy punk and Balkan beats.Covering the thirteenth century to the present day, and with a geographical scope that ranges from rural Romania to New York by way of Budapest, Moscow and Andalusia, Gypsy Music reveals the remarkable diversity of this exuberant art form""--Page [4] of cover.

Choral monuments,Dennis Shrock,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19726852W,/authors/OL5113000A/Dennis_Shrock,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 438,"Provides extensive material about eleven epoch-making choral masterworks that span the history of Western culture. Included are: Missa Pange lingua (Josquin Desprez); Missa Papae Marcelli (G. P. da Palestrina); B Minor Mass (J. S. Bach); Messiah (G. F. Handel); The Creation (Joseph Haydn); Symphony #9 (Ludwig van Beethoven); St. Paul (Felix Mendelssohn); Ein deutsches Requiem (Johannes Brahms); Messa da Requiem (Giuseppe Verdi); Mass (Igor Stravinsky); and War Requiem (Benjamin Britten). The works are presented in separate chapters, with each chapter divided into three basic sections-history, analysis, and performance practice. Discussions of history are focused on relevancies-the genesis of the designated work in reference to the composer's total choral output, the work's place within the musical environment and social climate of its time, and essential features of the work that make it noteworthy. In addition, the compositional history addresses three other factors: the work's public reception and critical response, both at the time of its composition and in ensuing years; the history of score publications, detailing the various differences between editions; and the texts of the composition. The material regarding textual treatment, which often includes the complete texts of the works being discussed, concentrates on primary concerns of the text's usage; also included in the discussion are noteworthy aspects of texts separate from the music as well as biographical details of librettists and poets, if appropriate. The analysis section of each chapter outlines and describes musical forms and other types of compositional organization, including parody technique, mirror structures, and motto repetitions, as well as salient compositional characteristics that directly relate and contribute to the work's artistic stature. Numerous charts and musical examples illustrate the discussions. The discussion of performance practices includes primary source quotations about a wide range of topics, from performing forces, tempo, and phrasing of each work to specific issues such as tactus, text underlay, musica ficta, metric accentuation, and ornamentation.

Trente ans plus tard, ce genre musical est non seulement bien vivant, mais il fait durablement partie des industries musicales, et la scène rap française est même l'une des plus visibles au niveau international. Comment le rap est-il né en France et comment s'est-il développé ? Qui a tiré profit de la commercialisation de ses chansons ? Pourquoi ce genre musical est-il si étroitement associé aux banlieues ? Qui sont les artistes qui l'ont promu, et en s'appuyant sur quelles ressources ? Pourquoi continue-t-il régulièrement à déchaîner les passions ? Émaillé de nombreux entretiens réalisés auprès de rappeurs, de DJ, d'animateurs, de professionnels de l'industrie du disque, etc., ce livre décrit comment l'émergence et l'inscription durable du rap en France ont été possibles. En s'intéressant aux artistes, mais aussi amateurs, en circulant des MJC des quartiers populaires aux bancs de l'Assemblée nationale, en observant les plateaux de télévision et les radios locales, Karim Hammou montre comment s'est imposée en France une nouvelle spécialité artistique, fondée sur une forme d'interprétation originale, ni parlée ni chantée : rappée.

Originally conceived by George Gershwin as an ""American folk opera"", Porgy and Bess premiered in New York in the fall of 1935 and featured an entire cast of classically trained African-American singers -- a daring artistic choice at the time. - Wikipedia.

Simrock|Pages 23,"In 1891 Dvorák arranged the final eighth dance of his popular first set of the ""Slavonic Dances"" op. 46 for violoncello and piano. The Czech composer Jirí Gemrot, born in 1957, has followed his example and has arranged the remaining dances for the same scoring. However in order to approach Dvorák's ideal sound Gemrot based his arrangements on the composer's orchestral score. Dvorák's own arrangement of ""Slavonic Dance"" No. 8 has been taken from the ""Complete Edition of the Works of Antonín Dvorák"", Volume IV/3 (Compositions for Violoncello). This is the first complete edition of the first set of Slavonic Dances arranged for violoncello and piano by Jirí Gemrot and includes Dvorák's own arrangement of Dance no. 8 with fingering and bowing by Tomáš Jamník.

Lagermusik e resistenza. Viktor Ullmann e Gideon Klein a Theresienstadt,Alessandro Carrieri,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL17043109W?edition=ia%3A9788871582054,/authors/OL6848527A/Alessandro_Carrieri,//archive.org/services/img/9788871582054,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Silvio Zamorani Editore,"The fortress town of Theresienstadt (Terezín in Czech), a few kilometres outside of Prague, became a Nazi ghetto-lager from 1941 to 1945. It existed with a two-fold purpose, on the one hand for confining the Jews of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and later those of the Reich, and on the other hand, in the final stages, as an instrument of propaganda directed to the international community which positively represented life and conditions of deported Jews. Within Theresienstadt many artistic and musical activities developed thanks to the presence of some of the most brilliant musicians in Europe.    This book focuses on the concept of resistance and political and cultural opposition to Hitler’s regime through the musical analysis of some of the compositions created in Theresienstadt. In particular the two composers taken into consideration are Viktor Ullmann    and Gideon Klein. The Sonata by Gideon Klein and the Sonata n. 5 and n. 6 by Viktor Ullmann, composed in 1943, are analysed in this book. The last chapter of the book focuses on the opera The Emperor of Atlantis or Death Abdicates written by Ullmann between 1943 and 1944, a work which recalls other compositions through frequently occurring musical fragments to effect a strong political and spiritual message.    This book investigates the meaning of the aesthetic choices of the two composers to better comprehend the philosophical thought and message of political and cultural resistance.

If you were the director of a major symphony orchestra, you could program only works by Mozart for an entire year--and still you would barely have scratched the surface of the composer's immense, and immensely moving, body of work.   The Mostly Mozart Guide to Mozart is an accessible, insightful, and entertaining resource for music lovers looking for a deeper understanding of the genius of Mozart. It combines a brief and revealing account of his life and times with a comprehensive survey of his major compositions. You'll also discover accounts of major performances, fascinating anecdotes about Mozart and his works, comments from artists past and present, and tips on what to listen for when you listen to Mozart. And, a selected discography will help you develop a fantastic collection of recordings by the finest modern musicians playing Mozart's greatest music.   Filled with insightful quotes from fellow composers, critics, and Mozart admirers, as well as informative illustrations, The Mostly Mozart Guide to Mozart answers all of your questions about this transcendent genius and his music, and probably some you never thought to ask.

Hindustani music,Deepak Raja,music,First published in 2005,/works/OL5763554W?edition=ia%3Ahindustanimusict0000raja,/authors/OL1403817A/Deepak_Raja,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3334748M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2005|Publisher  D.K. Printworld,              DK Printworld|Language English|Pages 432","About the Book:  ""Hindustani Music: A tradition in transition"" is a wide-ranging survey of the North Indian tradition of classical music during the post-independence period. Explicitly, this book addresses music lovers of above-average familiarity with Hindustani music, and their curiosity about its inner workings. It is, however, also a valuable reference for scholars and other writers on music.  The book is based on author's long years of training as a musician, vast experience as an analyst of music, and an observer of the cultural environment.  This book is divided into six parts.  Part I articulates an Indian perspective on important societal, cultural, economic and technological drivers of Hindustani music.  Part II discusses issues pertaining to presentation formats, and the structural and melodic aspects of Hindustani music.  Part III deals with the notion of raga-ness, and the world of ragas.  Part IV presents comprehensive backgrounders on the four major genres of vocal music - Dhrupad, Khayal, Thumree, and Tappa.  Part V features detailed fact-sheets on eight major melodic instruments of Hindustani tradition - Rudra Veena, Sitar, Surbahar, Sarod, Sarangi, Shehnai, Santoor, and the Indian classical (Hawaiian) guitar.  Part VI presents a glossary of words in italics, a list of suggested readings, and an index.  The book makes complex musicological concepts accessible to non-academic readers, and contributes significantly to widening the understanding of contemporary trends in Hindustani music. Written by an author of impeccable credentials as a musician, researchers, and author, this book is very significant addition to a body of authoritative writing on 20th century Hindustani music.  Experts from Reviews:  "" I commend Deepak Raja's book as a serious review of the Hindustani music tradition in the post-independence era. Deepak is an author with a keen analytical mind, imbued with a scientific approach. His chapters on raga grammar, raga authenticity, raga chemistry, and introductory essays on Dhrupad, Khayal, Thumree and Tappa can be of immense value to music students and scholars. His essays on the time-theory of ragas is a thought-provoking piece of writing, which deserves the attention of the music fraternity in view of the changing context of music performance and enjoyment. I sincerely hope that this book will be widely read, and will encourage the serious discussion and debate on different facets of Hindustani music""  Shiv Kumar Sharma  "" Deepak Raja's volume is a welcome overview of the recent trends in Hindustani music. It provides a panoramic, rather than encyclopedic, appraisal of important developments in Hindustani music, and confronts us with the problems that Indian classical music faces today Raja has a very definite point of view and argues it passionately.""  Lyle Wachovsky  About the Author:  Deepak Raja [Born: 1948] is amongst the finest contemporary writers on Hindustani music. He is a Repertoire Analyst for Indian Archive Music Ltd., New York, the most influential procedure of Hindustani music outside India. He is also a columnist for Sruti, the performing arts monthly, and frequently contributes papers to seminars and journals of the ITC-Sangeet Research Academy, Sangeet Natak Akademi, and the Indian Musicological Society.  The author is a sitar and surbahar player of the Imdad Khan/ Etawah gharana, trained for over forty years by two of its stalwarts, Shri Pulin Deb Burman, and Pandit Arvind Parikh. He studies Khayal under Pandit Dhondutai Kulkarni of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana. As a performer, he is respected for the soundness of his approach to music, and his command over the instruments.  Deepak Raja took a BA Honours degree from Delhi University, an MBA from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and studied advertising at the Watford College of Technology in the UK. For over thirty years, he has been a prolific writer on media industry, including the Editorship of Business India. While being well versed in the tradition concepts of Indian musicology, he brings to the subject a fresh perspective using the conceptual tools and analytical methods cultivated by his careers in media research, business journalism and financial consultancy.

When she gets on the turntables, her gift for spinning and rhyming earn her admiration and respect. She's also talented academically, but her parents disapprove of their daughter's hobby, hoping it's a phase she's going through. Still, Jasmine finds it hard to deny the joy and freedom she feels when she's playing music that makes people smile and dance.  After a local contest, Jasmine attracts the interest of some music-industry honchos. Then the attitudes of the people around her seem to change and she's forced to face some tough situations. Suddenly it becomes harder for her to tell who's really happy for her and who's totally a fake. But when the music is in your heart, and your talent shines bright, sometimes all you can do is…spin it like that.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the time he was an infant, Fieldy watched his dad's band perform, and soon enough he found his own calling: the bass. After high school, with a guitar and little else, he left his small California town for the music scene in L.A. Before long, Fieldy, Brian ""Head"" Welch, James ""Munky"" Shaffer, drummer David Silveria, and Jonathan Davis would gel together and form a band with a completely new sound—Korn.What happened next was something Fieldy had always dreamed of but was totally unprepared for: Korn exploded, skyrocketing to the top of the charts and fronting the nu metal phenomenon. Fieldy was thrust into the fast-paced, hard-rocking spotlight. Korn began to tour incessantly, creating intense live shows fueled by wild offstage antics. Fieldy became a rock star, and he acted like one, notorious not only for his one-of-a-kind bass lines, but also for his hard-partying, womanizing, bad-boy ways. The more drugs he took, the more booze he drank, the worse he became: He was unfaithful, abusive, mean, and sometimes violent.By all appearances, Fieldy had the life. But he was on the dark path of excess, alienating friends, families, and loved ones, nearly destroying himself and the band. It took an unexpected tragedy to straighten him out: the death of his father, a born-again Christian, to a mysterious illness. Following his father's dying wish, Fieldy found God. Filled with the spirit of his new faith, Fieldy quit drugs and drinking cold turkey, and found the best part of himself.With never-before-seen photos, and never-before-heard stories, Got the Life is raw, candid, and inspiring—the ultimate story of rock and redemption.

Is Rock Dead? sets out to explore the varied and sometimes conflicting ways in which the death of rock has been discussed both within the discourse of popular music and American culture. If rock is dead, when did it die? Who killed it? Why do rock journalists lament its passing? Has its academic acceptance stabbed it in the back or resuscitated an otherwise lifeless corpse? Why is rock music the music that conservatives love to hate? On the other side of the coin, how have rock's biggest fans helped nail shut the coffin? Does rock feed on its own death-and-rebirth? Finally, what signs of life are there showing that rock in fact is surviving?Is Rock Dead? will appeal to all those who take seriously the notion that rock is a serious musical form. It    will appeal to students of popular music and culture, and all those who have ever spun a 45, cranked up the radio, or strummed an air guitar.

Bad Singer chronicles his quest to understand the brain science behind tone-deafness and to search for ways to retrain the adult brain. He is tested by numerous scientists who are as fascinated with him as he is with them. He also investigates why we love music and deconstructs what we are really hearing when we listen to it. Throughout this journey of scientific and psychological discovery, he puts theory to practice by taking voice and breathing lessons with a voice coach in order to achieve his personal goal: a public display of his singing abilities. A work of scientific discovery, musicology, and personal odyssey, Bad Singer is a fascinating, insightful, and highly entertaining account from an award-winning journalist and author [Publisher description]   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Romantic music,Arnold Whittall,music,First published in 1987,/works/OL3741391W?edition=ia%3Aromanticmusic00arno,/authors/OL656639A/Arnold_Whittall,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL2746339M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1987|Publisher  Thames and Hudson|Language English|Pages 192,"Romanticism, the dominant mode of nineteenth-century musical expression, is associated most readily with the full-blooded passion and emotion to be found in such masterpieces as Chopin's ""Revolutionary"" Study and Wagner's epic music drama, the ""Ring."" Arnold Whittall explains how Romantic composers were faced with the challenge of devising appropriate and adequately coherent structures out of those often felt to be old-fashioned and restrictive. He covers the emergence of Romantic music in Germany, Italy and France as seen in the work of such composers as Weber, Schumann, Donizetti, Berlioz and Chopin, and then goes on to explore the operatic achievements of Wagner and Verdi alongside the predominantly instrumental programmatic works of Liszt and the nationalists of Russia, Bohemia and Scandinavia. The last part of the book traces the flowering of late Romanticism in Vienna, focusing on Brahms, Bruckner and Wolf, and shows how Mahler, Puccini, Rakhmaninov and Sibelius have continued the Romantic tradition in this century. 51 illus.

Singing the Congregation,Monique M.

Author Monique M. Ingalls argues that participatory worship music performances have brought into being new religious social constellations, or ""modes of congregating"". Through exploration of five of these modes -- concert, conference, church, public, and networked congregations -- Singing the Congregation reinvigorates the analytic categories of ""congregation"" and ""congregational music."" Drawing from theoretical models in ethnomusicology and congregational studies, Singing the Congregation reconceives the congregation as a fluid, contingent social constellation that is actively performed into being through communal practice -- in this case, the musically-structured participatory activity known as ""worship."" ""Congregational music-making"" is thereby recast as a practice capable of weaving together a religious community both inside and outside local institutional churches. Congregational music-making is not only a means of expressing local concerns and constituting the local religious community; it is also a powerful way to identify with far-flung individuals, institutions, and networks that comprise this global religious community. The interactions among the congregations reveal widespread conflicts over religious authority, carrying far-ranging implications for how evangelicals position themselves relative to other groups in North America and beyond. - Publisher.

Fiol-Matta shows how these musicians, despite seemingly intractable demands to represent gender norms, exercised their artistic and political agency by challenging expectations of how they should look, sound, and act. Fiol-Matta also breaks with conceptualizations of the female pop voice as spontaneous and intuitive, interrogating the notion of ""the great woman singer"" to deploy her concept of the ""thinking voice""an event of music, voice, and listening that rewrites dominant narratives. Anchored in the work of Lacan, Foucault, and others, Fiol-Matta's theorization of voice and gender in The Great Woman Singer makes accessible the singing voice's conceptual dimensions while revealing a dynamic archive of Puerto Rican and Latin American popular music.

His scrupulously crafted albums and sensational live shows have thrilled his worldwide following since the early seventies; with each all-too-rare album in the charts for months, every concert a sell-out, it is easy to see why, along with Bob Dylan and the Beatles, he holds the dubious honour of being one of rock'n'roll's most bootlegged artists.  In Blinded by the Light, journalist Patrick Humphries and Springsteen collector Chris Hunt have brought together all the strands of Springsteen's extraordinary career. They have combined a biography with a comprehensive catalogue of all his recorded material and concert performances. Part of Springsteen's appeal lies in is knowledge and affection for rock'n'roll history. In this well-documented retrospective the authors have brought together all the diverse influences which characterize Springsteen's performance style, listing every recording (legitimate or otherwise) every concert appearance, every song written or performed, to make this the ultimate Springsteen manual."" --Back cover.

Woodstock Scholarship,Jeffrey N. Gatten,music,First published in 2016,/works/OL20931336W,/authors/OL451185A/Jeffrey_N._Gatten,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 194,"""Since August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair looms large when recounting the history and impact of the baby boom generation and the societal upheavals of the Sixties. Scholars study the sociological, political, musical, and artistic impact of the event and use it as a cultural touchstone when exploring alternative perspectives or seeking clarity. This interdisciplinary annotated bibliography records the details of over 400 English-language resources on the Festival, including books, chapters, articles, websites, transcriptions and videos. Divided into six main subsections―Culture & Society, History, Biography, Music, Film, Arts & Literature―for ease of consultation Woodstock Scholarship sheds light on all facets of a key happening in our collective history. Throughout the 1960s, popular music became increasingly reflective and suggestive of the rising political and social consciousness of the youth culture. Examples can be seen in the development of the protest song genre within the folk music boom of the early Sixties and the marriage of lifestyle to music first reflected by The Beatles with fashion, followed by psychedelic music with the emerging drug culture. Woodstock was where these themes coalesced, thus becoming the defining and last great moment of the 1960s. However, Woodstock also represented an abundant amount of experiences and ideas and moments. Thus, when exploring the complicated accounts and numerous facets of America during the turbulent Sixties one discovers scholarship on the key subjects, such as the Vietnam War or the Civil Rights Movement, often considering and debating the importance, relevance, and epic nature of Woodstock. Multiple narratives emerge: a radical engagement of the hippie movement, an overt commercial exploitation of youth culture, a political statement. Woodstock scholarship does not stand alone as field of study, but it is at the cross-road of a number of disciplines―music history, cultural studies, sociology, arts and literature, media studies, politics and economics.    Providing full bibliographical details and concise, informative annotation for each entry, Woodstock Scholarship is an essential tool for students, scholars, teachers, and librarians in all these areas, as well as for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of both the Woodstock Music and Art Fair phenomenon and of the confluence of music, commerce and politics.""

Thoughtrave,Robert Craig Baum,music,First published in 2016,/works/OL20928135W,/authors/OL8010920A/Robert_Craig_Baum,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  punctum books|Pages 206,"Thoughtrave is the immediate and most detailed archive of Lady Gaga’s emotional, intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual evolution, a reclaiming of her art (and humanity) from within the center of her celebrity during one of the most difficult transitions of her career: Summer 2013­–Fall 2014.  I don’t like being used to make money. I feel sad when I am overworked and that I just become a money making machine and that my passion and my creativity take a backseat. That makes me unhappy. So, what did I do? I started to say no. Not doing that. I don’t want to do that. I’m not taking that picture. Not going to that event. Not standing by that because that’s not what I stand for.  Thoughtrave marks perhaps the most important (and unconditional, unpublished, unencumbered) insights into the music industry, as well as into the personal battles that accompanied her transition from Stefani to Gaga. “It’s one of those rare moments in life when you ask a question of someone you’ve admired for many years and receive the most honest of answers leading both people into a relationship that was and remains one of the most important of my life,” says Baum, a professor, producer, composer, writer, editor, and activist for adjunct professors. As Baum explains to Stefani in one of the many interviews published here for the first time,  It’s uncanny for me to look back at 2008–2011 — when I was intensely meditating on the problem “Why is there any being at all?” — to find evidence of your intervention here with me…to find you, back then…before I knew you. It was almost as if I was playing the Bruce Willis character in Twelve Monkeys, overshooting my mark in time/space, aiming for this particular conversation but speaking through Ereignis (life gives) to a moment I (and many others) call “headphones on.”   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Though he loved working there as a kid, Ari cannot fathom a life wasting away over rising dough and hot ovens. But while interviewing candidates for his replacement, Ari meets Hector, an easygoing guy who loves baking as much as Ari wants to escape it. As they become closer over batches of bread, love is ready to bloom . . . that is, if Ari doesn’t ruin everything.  Writer Kevin Panetta and artist Savanna Ganucheau concoct a delicious recipe of intricately illustrated baking scenes and blushing young love, in which the choices we make can have terrible consequences, but the people who love us can help us grow.

Given that hip hop music alone generates more than a billion dollars in annual sales, the absence of a major black record company is disturbing. Here, for the first time, is a collection of voices and perspectives that provides a nuanced investigation into this structure of stealing. Editor Norman Kelley joins forces with a crew of veteran journalists and principled musicians to examine how black music has been developed, marketed, and distributed within the structure of American capitalism. R&B also considers how the changes and developments within the music business--from the frontier of digital technology to the consolidation of the giant music conglomerates--might affect the future roles of African-Americans in the industry.

Pitch perfect: the quest for collegiate a cappella glory,Mickey Rapkin,music,First published in 2008,/works/OL13852131W,/authors/OL6721743A/Mickey_Rapkin,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24252914M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Gotham Books|Language English,"Pitch Perfect is a behind-the-scenes look at the bizarre, often inspiring world of collegiate a cappella groups. The first collegiate a cappella group, the Yale Whiffenpoofs, was founded by Cole Porter back in 1909. But what had been largely an Ivy League phenomenon has, in the past fifteen years, exploded. And itas not what you think. There are now more than 1,200 a cappella groups at colleges across the country. The very best of these collegiate groups square off in the annual International Championship of Collegiate A Cappellaaa showdown marked by wrenching close calls and exhilarating triumphs. And, really, where else can you hear Michael Jacksonas aBada in four-part harmony? In Pitch Perfect, GQ editor Mickey Rapkin follows a season in a cappella through all its twists and turns, covering the breathtaking displays of vocal talent, the groupies (yes, a cappella singers have groupies), the rockstar partying (and run-ins with the law), and all the bitter rivalries. Along the way are encounters with boldfaced names such as President George W. Bush, Prince, David Letterman, Barack Obama, Barbra Streisand, Hillary Clinton, Marisa Tomei, Amanda Bynes, Nick Lachey, Merv Griffin, Jim Carrey, Microsoftas Paul Allen, John Legend, and Jessica Biel. At the heart of the narrative are three a cappella groups whose interactions are anything but harmonious: the historic Tufts Beelzebubs, founded more than forty years ago with 40,000 albums sold sinceaand struggling to record a new album that lives up to the hype; Divisi of the University of Oregon, a relatively new, all-female group attempting to overcome a loss in the 2005 championship; and the University of Virginia Hullabahoos, the so-called bad boys of collegiate a cappella, who will attempt to compete on a higher level this year while retaining their casual soul. Bringing a lively new twist to Americaas fascination with talent showdowns and peerless performers, Pitch Perfect is sure to strike a chord with readers.

As it was written in 1941, the book addresses both ""straight"" orchestration and ""dance"" orchestration in a very insightful way, offering examples of passages scored in both styles for the student to examine.  Collinson's dry humor pervades the book, making it an enjoyable read, as much as an orchestration book can be enjoyable to read.  Mostly, the reader is impressed with Collinson's deft handling of the topic, no doubt the result of having enjoyed a busy career both as a conductor and orchestrater in the British musical theatre scene.

Jahrhunderts überhaupt. Seinerzeit wurde sie von der internationalen Wagnerforschung als Grundlegung für eine vertiefte Diskussion über Wagners Haltung in dieser Frage begrüßt. Zum erstenmal erlaubt sie es einer größeren Leserschaft, die Schrift Wagners in beiden Versionen, der ursprünglichen von 1850 und der erheblich erweiterten von 1869 kennenzulernen. Eine umfangreiche Einleitung bettet Wagners Vorstellungen in den Kontext seiner Zeit ein, ohne dabei die Strukturen seiner persönlichen Judenfeindschaft zu vernachlässigen. Ein gewichtiger Teil des Buches dokumentiert außerdem die zeitgenössischen Reaktionen, die es vor allem auf die Zweitpublikation gab. Seit geraumer Zeit ist diese Dokumentation vergriffen, aber immer wieder wurde eine Neuausgabe gewünscht. Sie wird nun hier vorgelegt, durchgesehen und bibliographisch auf den neuesten Stand gebracht. Damit ist eine Grundlagenpublikation zu einem Thema, das in den letzten Jahren, besonders im Wagnerjubiläumsjahr 2013, an Brisanz noch gewonnen hat, erneut greifbar""--Back cover.

With a voice that Pitchfork has called 'as scratchy as a three-day beard yet as supple and pliable as moccasin leather,' former Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age vocalist Mark Lanegan draws frequent comparisons to masters like Nick Cave and Leonard Cohen. Lanegan's voice is one of the most distinct and recognizable in rock, but his talents aren't limited to his vocal skills. Lanegan's lyrics are on par with the best of them, exploring with Blake-like insight the stark and scorched emotional terrain that exists somewhere beyond sadness, addiction, trauma, and spiritual longing. With a body of work that now includes seven albums with the Screaming Trees, eleven acclaimed solo albums, three albums of duets with Belle and Sebastian's Isobel Campbell (including the Mercury Prize-shortlisted Ballad of the Broken Seas), and collaborative albums and singles with the likes of Queens of the Stone Age, Moby, Soulsavers, Twilight Singers, and countless others, Mark Lanegan occupies a singular space in rock music. Now, for the first time ever, the reclusive singer presents a comprehensive look at his lyrics, the stories behind them, and the making of his albums"" --Inside dust jacket.

The purpose of the forum is to generate innovative, unexplored, and provocative dialogues that will become part of Cleveland’s cultural inventory. Jaron Lanier, computer scientist, composer, and visual artist from Berkeley, California was the moderator for both programs. In April he held a public conversation with Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran, a scientist interested in art and the brain. The discussion topic was learning to appreciate the brain in new ways because of new technologies for looking at the brain. In October he held a second public conversation with Paul D. Miller, also known as DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid, talking about music and the implications of technology, internet, and digital media on contemporary culture.

In her history of music and race in midcentury America, Christina D. Abreu argues that these musicians, through their work in music festivals, nightclubs, social clubs, and television and film productions, played central roles in the development of Cuban, Afro-Cuban, Latino, and Afro-Latino identities and communities. Abreu draws from previously untapped oral histories, cultural materials, and Spanish-language media to uncover the lives and broader social and cultural significance of these vibrant performers""--Provided by publisher.

The settlers' dialects evolved into a formal language which has been spoken and read for three centuries throughout much of Pennsylvania and, more recently, in parts of the Middle and Far West and Canada. The book contains 13 readings -- on such topics as school, house, farm, and town, as well as dates, weather, body parts, and clothing -- each with translations on facing pages and followed by vocabulary and grammatical rules. By the end of the book all major rules of grammar have been covered together with a substantial working vocabulary. An introduction gives an overview of the language and a guide to pronunciation; an appendix presents practice patterns for the serious student; and an index leads to definitions of all vocabulary words. - Jacket flap.

Once upon a time in Shaolin,Cyrus Bozorgmehr,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL19710902W,/authors/OL7521031A/Cyrus_Bozorgmehr,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Flatiron Books|Language English|Pages 274,"Reveals how the Wu-Tang Clan secretly recorded a single-copy album before auctioning it for millions to one of the most hated men in America, detailing how they prevented leaks using strategies that reflect present-day views on creative property and music devaluation.  ""The untold story of the world's must controversial album--a surreal tale of secret recordings, baffled customs agents, the world's most hallowed art institutions, and a villain of comic book proportions. In 2007, the innovative young Wu-Tang producer, Cilvaringz, took an incendiary idea to his mentor the RZA. They felt that the impact of digitization threatened the sustainability of the record industry and independent artists, while shifting the perception of music from treasured works of art to disposable consumer products. Together they conceived a statement so radical that it would unleash a torrent of global debate--a sole copy of an album in physical form, encased in gleaming silver and sold through an auction house for millions as a work of contemporary art. The execution of this plan raised a number of complex questions: Would selling an album for millions be the ultimate betrayal of music? How would fans react to an album sold on the condition that it could not be commercialized? And could anyone ever justify the selling of the album to the infamous Martin Shkreli? As headlines flashed across the globe, the mystery only deepened. Opinions were sharply divided over whether this was high art or hucksterism--quixotic idealism or a cynical cash grab. Was it a noble act of protest, an act of cultural vandalism, an obscene symbol of greed, a subversive masterpiece, a profound mirror for our time, or a joker on capitalism's card table? As senior adviser to the project, Cyrus Bozorgmehr is uniquely placed to unlock the secrets behind the album and tell the full, unadulterated story. With explosive revelations about backroom plans made public tor the first time, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin charts the album's journey from inception to disruption in vivid style. An extraordinary adventure that veers between outlandish caper and urgent cultural analysis, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin twists and turns through the mayhem and mischief, while asking profound questions about our relationship with art, music, technology, and, ultimately, ourselves.""--Jacket.
