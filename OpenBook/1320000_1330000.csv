Aguéli föddes 1869 och dog redan 1917, överkörd av ett tåg utanför Barcelona. Han studerade i Paris och blev anarkist, målade senare under långa perioder i Egypten där han konverterade till islam och inträdde i en sufisk orden. I Simon Sorgenfreis studie av Aguélis måleri och religiösa tänkande är det särskilt hans förhållande till den svenske 1700-talsmystikern Emanuel Swedenborg som lyfts fram. Boken bygger på arkivmaterial, brev, dagböcker och manuskript, och visar hur Aguélis landskapsmåleri kan förstås som ett uttryck för hans religiösa sökande""--Back cover.

The Gospel in brief,Lev Nikolaevič Tolstoy,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL27716157W?edition=ia%3Agospelinbrief0000tols,/authors/OL26783A/Lev_Nikolaevič_Tolstoy,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL37814104M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  [Aziloth Books]|Language English|Pages 128,"""Leo Tolstoy is famous the world over for his epic novels of Russian history and society. But during the last 30 years of his life Tolstoy devoted himself to spiritual matters in an attempt to return Christianity to the fundamental teachings of Christ, shorn of both biblical additions and interpolations, and the obfuscating hand of Church dogma. 'The Gospel in Brief' is the culmination of this long endeavour, a composite account taken only from the Four Gospels. Working with the oldest original Greek versions, Tolstoy set aside all accounts of miracles, genealogies, and prophecies, seeking the core philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, and a solution -- in the words of Christ himself -- to 'the problem of life.' The result is a compelling account of a teacher whose basic message was the Unity of all existence: God is the giver of life, and within all things. For Tolstoy, acknowledgement of this central fact, that 'the Kingdom of God is Within You,' immanent in all existence, bestows liberation from the illusions of time and selfhood, and makes easy Christ's admonition to 'love God, and your neighbour as yourself.' This Aziloth edition is fully annotated, allowing each section of Tolstoy's compilation to be related directly to the relevant Gospel passage. A book that will uplift and give new direction to both Christian and agnostic alike."" --   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Esta faceta poco difundida del Prócer ha sido ampliamente desarrollada y documentada por Pedro Gaudiano en su libro “ARTIGAS CATÓLICO”, cuya segunda edición apareció en 2004, ampliada con un prólogo de Arturo Ardao y con un índice de personas y otro de lugares. El libro fue coeditado por las Universidades Católicas de Uruguay y de Asunción del Paraguay. Fue presentado con gran éxito en Uruguay, Argentina y Paraguay. Llama la atención que los testimonios que aporta este libro hayan sido olvidados o dejados de lado deliberadamente por diversos autores que han analizado la vida del Prócer.

Oracle bone script was used for divination through fire in the Shang dynasty (c.1600-1046 BCE).This research explores ways to promote and enhance audience interest in the script through storytelling strategies that use interactive technology in an exhibition context. Through the course of this study, I found that there is a lack of publicity and cultural engagement with oracle bone script and that this has contributed to the general public knowing little about its historical importance. Therefore, I have created a proposal for an exhibition that showcases, through various means, this significant Chinese historical legacy. researchers.

The Tāwhaki myths were chosen because of their relative obscurity in the modern era (Mead, 1996). I examine three possible ways these myths may be interpreted using digital media. I then build a video game prototype based on one of these interpretations. I conclude with a discussion about the creation process of building this prototype, focusing primarily on writing issues which pertain to the retelling of the Tāwhaki myths.

House|Language English|Pages 333,"""Reality is experience, and experience is reality,"" says Hawaiian shaman Serge King, speaking of Huna, the esoteric tradition in which he was reared. King emphasizes that all of us have the ability to shift from one world to another. The difference is that shamans do it purposefully, while the rest of us are unaware of it. He trains us to engage in the process consciously in order to expand our human potential. Among books on Huna, this one is unique for offering actual practices for changing our reality to create the life we want.  In a user-friendly, conversational style, King's chapters explain the four worlds of a shaman and basic Huna principles. Then, citing case studies, he guides us in how to change reality in each of the four worlds, bringing in ESP, telepathy, the perception of auras, telekinesis, dreaming, magical flight, and, finally, soul retrieval and the great power of healing.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Religious minorities, integration and the State; État, minorités religieuses et intégration",John Tolan,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL23500987W,/authors/OL2699785A/John_Tolan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Brepols|Pages 230,"Judaism, Christianity and Islam have coexisted in Europe for over 1300 years. The three monotheistic faiths differ in demography, in the moment of their arrival on the continent and in the unequal relations they maintain with power: Christianity was chosen by a large number of inhabitants and became — in spite of important differences according to place and time —a religion of state. The organization of the continent into states and the divisions within Christianity often placed minorities in an unstable and at times painful situation. This partially explains the fight against ""heresies"", the wars of religions, the expulsion of Jews from several European kingdoms (as well as the expulsion of Muslims from Sicily and the Iberian peninsula), the ""Jewish question"" in the 19th century up until the Holocaust. Since the 20th century, the debates concerning Islam and concerning public expression of religion are shaped in part by this past. The 13 studies gathered in this volume explore the ways in which states have treated their religious minorities. We study various policies — repression, supervision, integration, tolerance, secularization, indifference — as well as the many ways in which minorities have accommodated the majority’s demands. The relation is by no means one-sided: on the contrary, state policies have created resistance, negotiation (on the legal, political, and cultural fronts) or compromise. Through these precise and original examples, we can see how the protagonists (states, religious institutions, the elite, the faithful) interact, try to convince or influence each other in order to transform practices, invent and implement common norms and grounds, all the while knowing the confessional dimension of ""religious"" majority and minority does not fully embrace the identity of each citizen in full.  Judaïsme, christianisme, islam ont en Europe une histoire millénaire. Ces monothéismes se différencient par leur poids respectif, par les moments de leur inscription sur le continent et par leurs inégaux rapports avec le pouvoir : le christianisme a été adopté par un très grand nombre d’habitants et est devenu – avec d’importantes variations selon les lieux et les époques – une religion officielle, faisant face, dès lors, à des religions minoritaires. La structuration du continent en États et la division du christianisme lui-même, entre le Moyen Age et le XVIe siècle, ont placé les minorités dans une situation souvent instable et douloureuse. Ainsi s’expliquent, pour partie, la lutte contre les « hérésies », les guerres de religion, l’expulsion des juifs de plusieurs royaumes européens (et aussi l’expulsion de Musulmans de la Sicile et de la péninsule ibérique), la « question juive » au XIXe siècle et jusqu’à la Shoah. C’est ce passé que réveille, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, le débat sur la place de l’islam et les manières de manifester sa foi dans l’espace public. Les 13 études réunies dans ce volume étudient les manières dont les États ont traité leurs minorités religieuses. On y voit des politiques diverses envers des minorités religieuses– répression, encadrement, intégration, tolérance, laïcité, indifférence – ainsi que de diverses  manières dont les minorités ont accueilli les exigences de la majorité. La relation n’est pas unilatérale : au contraire, les politiques étatiques donnent lieu à des résistances, des négociations (sur le plan légal, politique, culturel, etc.) ou compromis.  À l’aide d’exemples précis et originaux, on voit comment les acteurs – États, institutions religieuses, élites, fidèles – interagissent, tentent de se convaincre, s’influencent pour transformer des pratiques, mettre au point des normes communes et inventer un terrain d’entente, sachant que la dimension confessionnelle des majorités et des minorités « religieuses » n’embrasse pas la totalité de l’identité de chaque citoyen.

It therefore deals especially with the return of religious themes and symbols into politics, with the analysis of the link between political theory and religion, and finally with the critical discussion of the secularization thesis. At the centre of the research are questions concerning the causes of violent conflict, the possibilities for a just world order and the conditions for peaceful coexistence on a local, regional, national and international/worldwide scale between communities in the face of divergent religious and ideological convictions. Its task is to initiate and coordinate thematically related research-efforts from various disciplinary backgrounds at the University of Innsbruck. It creates a network between departments, research-teams and single researchers working on topics of religion, politics and violence. The overall aim of the research platform World Order-Religion-Violence is to promote excellence in social and human science research on religion and politics at the University of Innsbruck and to guarantee the diffusion of this particular competence on a national and international level.""

No estaban obligados a mantenerse en torno a un único tema, antes bien, tenían plena facultad para introducir digresiones y tocar puntos menos relacionados con el que era objeto especial de su estudio.  Este libro contiene doce conferencias reconstruidas sobre temas diversos, pero que tienen que ver todos ellos con Dios y con la religión. Por el modo de tratar los diversos temas, este libro no podría clasificarse como un libro de Sociología, o de Psicología de la religión, sino, más bien, como un libro de filosofía de la religión, siempre que se tenga presente que esta denominación, lejos de expresar algo unitario, engloba «géneros literarios» y estilos de pensamiento totalmente distintos. Precisando más, cabría decir que éste es un libro de filosofía positiva de la religión, o de filosofía materialista de la religión –pero no un libro de filosofía analítica o de filosofía metafísica de la religión. Cada una de las cuestiones de que consta, sin perjuicio de las múltiples relaciones que mantiene con las demás, es, en cierto modo, una unidad independiente. El libro puede comenzarse por cualquiera de sus capítulos.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ernest Thompson Seton (1860-1946) was one of the earliest supporters of the political, cultural, and spiritual rights of First Peoples, and as a corrective to the materialistic worldview and environmental abuses of our day, The Gospel of the Redman is a prophetic work. This commemorative edition contains for the first time Seton’s drawings of American Indian motifs, a selection of photographs illustrating his life, information about his role as founder of the Boy Scouts of America, and his friendship with prominent American Indian leaders.As one of the earliest authentic books on traditional Native American philosophy, The Gospel of the Redman continues to be a valuable source to understand the perennial wisdom of the American Indians in its essential form, and it speaks in an eloquently simple language to the heart of all who seek to better understand how to conserve and protect the earth.

In The Two Faces of Islam, Stephen Schwartz, who has devoted years to the study of Islam, explains its complex history and describes the profound philosophical and religious differences that distinguish traditional beliefs from the radical sects that have sprung up over the past fifteen hundred years. He focuses on Wahhabism, the puritanical sect to which Osama bin Laden belongs. Founded in the eighteenth century by a radical cleric, this intolerant ""Islamo-fascist"" sect became the official creed of the Saudi Arabian state and has been exported to Moslem countries from the Balkans to the Philippines, as well as to Islamic communities in Western Europe and the United States. By setting the current upheavals within an historical and religious context, Schwartz demonstrates that Osama bin Laden and his followers are not really fighting a war against America. Rather, they are engaged in a revolution within Islam itself--a movement that parallels the turmoil within Christianity during the sixteenth century. Schwartz not only exposes the collusion of the Saudi Arabian government in the spread of radical Islam (which makes them at best reluctant allies of the West), he shows that the majority of Moslems have little sympathy for the Wahhabis and that many openly denounce their motivations and goals. A riveting narrative that never smacks of propaganda, The Two Faces of Islam is essential reading for anyone who seeks to understand who we are fighting, what our enemies believe, and who our friends in the Moslem world really are.From the Hardcover edition.

Written for Jews and non-Jews alike, be they students, teachers, or general interested readers, the book brings out the extraordinary richness and variety of Judaism: its historical depth, and the vigour and at times amazing endurance of its traditions - in the home, in the synagogue, in its literature, in individual and community life. Nicholas de Lange explains the history and details of inherited rituals and customs; of established religion; of concepts such as Zionism, Diaspora, Messianism. Half of the world's Jews live in North America and the rest are widely scattered, and the book is sensitive to the global context of Judaism. An Introduction to Judaism contains illustrative tables and maps, a full glossary, chronology, bibliography and index. This is a stimulating and comprehensive introduction to a major world culture.

Written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and hidden in caves by an ancient Jewish sect, these mysterious manuscripts revolutionized our understanding of the Bible, of Judaism and the early Christian world.Geza Vermes is the world's leading Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, whose English translations brought these extraordinary documents to thousands, and whose life has been inextricably interwoven with the scrolls for over sixty years. In this illuminating book he relates the controversial story of their discovery and publication around the world, revealing cover-ups, blunders and academic in-fighting, but also the passion and dedication of many of those involved. He shares what he has learned about the scrolls and, evaluating passages from them, gives his views on their true significance and what they can teach us, as well as those areas where scholarly consensus has not yet been reached.Few scholars have been as closely associated with the Dead Sea Scrolls as Vermes. Writing with candour and unique authority, he has created an ideal introduction to understanding these miraculous documents.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The story revolves around the broadsword-wielding Derick Davidson who lands in Boston after escaping British authorities in his native Scotland. He befriends Daniel Morgan, a militia commander from Virginia who helps him escape the British again. In Virginia, Morgan introduces him to his neighbors and their teenaged daughter, Kearan. She will figure prominently in his life.  Over the course of several years, Derick becomes a skilled rifleman and is asked to help the Patriots in their coming conflict with England. He refuses, citing Scotland's failure to defeat the armies of Great Britain over several centuries. He comes to know God's forgiveness for crimes in his past and eventually joins the American Patriots.  God's love, providence and forgiveness are all important elements of this prequel to the Wild Rose Series of well researched and touchingly presented historical novels.

Dogen Zenji's Shobogenzo Genjo-koan,Dōgen Zenji,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16414365W,/authors/OL2782083A/Dōgen_Zenji,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Counterpoint|Language English,"""One of the greatest religious practitioners and philosophers of the East, Eihei Dogen Zenji (1200-1253) is today thought of as the founder of the Soto school of Zen. A deep thinker and writer, he was deeply involved in monastic methods and in integrating Zen realization into daily life. At times The Shobogenzo was profoundly difficult, and he worked on it over his entire life, revising and expanding, producing a book that is today thought to be one of the highest manifestations of Buddhist thought ever produced. Dogen's Genjo Koan is the first chapter in that book, and for many followers it might be thought to contain the gist of Dogen's work-it is one of the groundwork texts of Zen Buddhism, standing easily alongside The Diamond Sutra, The Heart Sutra, and a small handful of others.  Our unique edition of Dogen's Genjo Koan (Actualization of Reality) contains three separate translations and several commentaries by a wide variety of Zen masters. Nishiari Bokusan, Shohaku Okamura, Shunryu Suzuki, Kosho Uchiyama. Sojun Mel Weitsman, Kazuaki Tanahashi, and Dairyu Michael Wenger all have contributed to our presentation of this remarkable work. There can be no doubt that understanding and integrating this text will have a profound effect on anyone's life and practice""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Natural reflections,Barbara Herrnstein Smith,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL15625444W?edition=ia%3Anaturalreflectio0000smit,/authors/OL542645A/Barbara_Herrnstein_Smith,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24573647M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Yale University Press|Language English|Pages 201,"In this important and original book, eminent scholar Barbara Herenstein Smith describes, assesses, and reflects upon a set of contemporary intellectual projects involving science, religion, and human cognition. One, which Smith calls ""the New Naturalism"", is the effort to explain religion on the basis of cognitive science. Another, which she calls ""the New Natural Theology"", is the attempt to reconcile natural-scientific accounts of the world with traditional religious belief. These two projects, she suggests, are in many ways mirror images -- or ""natural reflections"" - of each other. Examing these and related efforts from the perspective of a constructivist-pragmatist epistemology, Smith argues that crucial aspects of belief - religious and other - that remain elusive or invisible under dominant rationalist and computational models are illuminated by views of human cognition that stress its dynamic, embodied, and interactive features. She also demonstrates how constructivist understandings of the formation and stabilization of knowledge - scientific and other - alert us to simularities in the springs of science and religion that are elsewhere seen largely in terms of difference and contrast. In Natural Reflections, Smith develops a sophisticated approach to issues often framed only polemically. Recognizing science and religion as complex, distinct domains of human practice, she also insists on their significant historical connections and cognitive continuities and offers important new modes of engagement with each of them--Jacket.

It examines man’s perception as regards the nature of philosophy, what constitutes philosophy and what actually is philosophy or philosophical thinking. In addition to an understanding of the documented cradle of philosophical thought from the western account of the history of philosophy and an insight to logic are contentious issues such as predestination, reincarnation and immortality of the soul, prayer, why? and Jesus in the light of esoteric understanding. The text went further to give an insight to African philosophy and stressed on the contentious issues bordering on the existence or non-existence of African philosophy and philosophers. In addition is an investigation on man’s search for an absolute Being that far exceeds a probe into the vastness of the cosmos and questioned the existence of evil in a world where an absolute Being exist.

Fundamentos da Cabala: Sêfer Yetsirá – edição revisada e ampliada,Carlos Antônio Pereira Campani,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16813102W,/authors/OL7172977A/Carlos_Antônio_Pereira_Campani,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25438776M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Editora e Gráfica da Universidade Federal de Pelotas|Language Portuguese|Pages 348,"“Fundamentos da Cabala: Sêfer Yetsirá” busca apresentar e elucidar um dos mais conhecidos textos cabalísticos, o Livro da Criação, Sêfer Yetsirá. O livro procura introduzir os fundamentos da cabala por meio dos temas mencionados no Sêfer Yetsirá. O Sêfer Yetsirá é um dos mais importantes textos cabalísticos e foi escrito, provavelmente, no séc. III da era cristã, sob inspiração gnóstica. Ele versa sobre o misticismo e a tradição mágico-esotérica judaica, descrevendo a criação divina, que é apresentada como sendo resultante das combinações e permutações das letras do Nome de Deus (YHVH). Sua importância para o cabalismo pode ser inferida do fato dele ser o texto judaico mais antigo que cita o conceito de Sefirá. Também é inegável a importância do Sêfer Yetsirá para maçons, rosacruzes e estudantes de ciências ocultas em geral. A tradução do Sêfer Yetsirá para o português foi feita diretamente do texto hebraico, que é apresentado na íntegra no livro. A tradução é acompanhada de explicações do autor e citações dos comentários dos mais renomados rabinos, eruditos e estudiosos, entre eles: Gershom Scholem, Aryeh Kaplan, Leonard Glotzer, Ithamar Gruenwald, Peter Hayman, Isidor Kalisch, Gaon de Vilna, Ramban, Raivad, Isaque o cego, Moisés Botarel, Otsar HaShem e Saadia Gaon. O livro inclui ainda uma introdução aos principais conceitos da cabala, um glossário de termos hebraicos que aparecem no texto e anexos sobre Adão Kadmon, cifras cabalísticas e Ain Sóf. Cada capítulo do livro finaliza com um exercício prático de meditação cabalística. Este livro procura relacionar as ideias da cabala, que aparecem no Sêfer Yetsirá, com correntes da filosofia e religião, principalmente neoplatonismo, vedanta, budismo e ioga. Ele foi escrito em uma perspectiva multirreligiosa e multicultural, para que pessoas de diferentes crenças possam usufruir das ideias da cabala judaica e das práticas da cabala mística e adapta-las às suas próprias crenças.

With this emigration, Sikhism has become considerably less exotic but hardly better known to outsiders. The A to Z of Sikhism provides a brief introduction, a chronology, and a dictionary containing several hundred entries that present the Gurus and other leaders, trace Sikhism's complex history, expound some of its precepts and concepts, describe many of its rites and rituals, and explain the meaning of numerous Sikh expressions.""--P.

Varör skulle han göra det? Är han god? Varför skulle han vara det? Är det rimligt att tro på en god gud med tanke på allt elände som finns? Bryr sig Gud om vad vi människor tror, tänker eller gör här på jorden? Uppstod Jesus verkligen från de döda? Vad menas med ""helig""? Får man skoja om sådant som är heligt för somliga men inte för andra? Vilka slutsatser kan man dra av att många terrordåd grundar sig på religiösa övertygelser?  Under samtalens gång synas religiösa synsätt i sömmarna utifrån en icke-religiös humanistisk livsåskådning, ofta på ett sätt som troende kan uppfatta som provokativt. Detta är i så fall bra, i synnerhet om det stimulerar till eftertanke och till att ifrågasätta invanda tankemönster, dogmer och doktriner, villfarelser, vidskepelse och andra vanföreställningar samt sist men inte minst religionerna själva liksom tron på det övernaturliga.  Carl-Johan Kleberg, tidigare ordförande för Humanisterna skrev så här om boken: ""Det blir alltmer angeläget med samtal om existentiella frågor. Att föra sådana samtal i en sluten vänkrets på en segelbåt är stimulerande och tankeväckande. Det bör kunna locka många till läsning"".

This understanding would relieve us from fear and doubt and pave the way to realize that our death is only another moment of the continued renewal process of our own life based on the flow of imprints of our own mind.   The rare opportunity that we have gained in human form of life is too precious to be neglected and wasted within the short span of existence in this sensual realm of life.    In order for us to properly understand the existence of life in the nature, we need to rightly understand the concept of space-time within which all forces and energies exist taking diverse conditions, forms, shapes, and names.

More recently it has been through media in the Middle East and, of course, directly with the occasional person I might talk to about Jesus: everywhere from a transatlantic air flight to a meeting in the street. I don't think I do it well. Looking around, I'm not sure many of us do it very well.""  This book looks at Jesus methods for communicating the Good News He came to bring, suggests models for evaluating how we share our faith and develops methods for communicating the Gospel with a post-modern generation of young people from the Middle East. Although written from the perspective of the people of the Middle East, the models and methods can be applied in many cultures across the world.  ""While you are reading this, you will find that there are areas I leave open to discussion or debate. Sometimes those are in places where I cannot personally see a clear Scriptural direction. Other times, I do see a clear Scriptural direction, but know of other Biblical followers of Jesus who see things differently. One of the major differences between following Jesus and being a Muslim is the acceptance of diversity. We should celebrate this. It's part of our freedom in Christ. He treats us as people with whom He wants a relationship."" ""Post-modern Christians frequently object to didactic - formal, structured, uni-directional teaching. They do not talk about a set of doctrines, but about a dialogue. This book, then, is an attempt to start such a dialogue.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

David McMahan wrote of Olcott that he ""allied Buddhism with scientific rationalism in implicit criticism of orthodox Christianity, but went well beyond the tenets of conventional science in extrapolating from the Romantic and Transcendentalist influenced 'occult sciences' of the nineteenth century.""

The question of whether Pius XII and the Vatican must bear blame for failing to act decisively in response to Hitler's Final Solution is as hotly debated today as in the years directly following World War II. INSIDE THE VATICAN OF PIUS XII presents for the first time the observations of an American diplomat who spent four years inside the Vatican.  This memoir of Harold H. Tittmann, Jr., describes his encounters with Pius XII and offers details that give a full picture of daily life in the Vatican. Writing of his own activities as a diplomat, Tittmann chronicles his role in assisting and hiding escaped prisoners of war and his experiences navigating the tensions with the representatives of enemy states, with whom he lived side by side.  Deftly conveying the beauty and solemnity of events that took place in the dramatic settings of St. Peter's, the Sistine Chapel, and the Pope's private chapel, Tittmann's work will be valued by historians and students of history for generations to come.

Florence Nightingale never questioned the day God called her into His service. But determining just what that service would be was another matter. ""Decent"" young women of the nineteenth century weren't expected to work -- especially not in the foul, disease-ridden medical camps of the British military. But that's where the ""Lady with the Lamp"" found her calling: comforting sick, wounded, and dying soldiers, and fighting for their rights within an apathetic establishment. From Scutari Hospital in the Crimean War, she turned the medical world upside down. Florence Nightingale's efforts revolutionized the care of hospital patients and elevated nursing to the noble rank it holds today. Most importantly, it clearly demonstrated Jesus' teaching of service ""unto the least of these my brethren."" - Back cover.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

They can be wicked, good, of dual nature, or non-existent. They announce, accompany, heal, injure, sway, charm, fight, tempt and judge. They can bring us closer to, or distract us from, God.  In this volume, the particular focus is on how angelic and demonic concepts are overtly expressed, or are more obliquely reflected, in different religions. Specific themes covered include spiritual warfare, spirit beings and the origin of evil, angelic and demonic roles, human suffering and spiritual powers, use of talismans, sacred texts, and the practical outworking of beliefs. The contributors – all Christian scholars – mostly write as detached observers of the religious traditions they are describing. Nevertheless, they do not shy away from taking a stand on controversial issues.  Here you will find a great diversity of thought, some striking thematic similarities, and a fascinating view of worlds far removed from our usual experience.  The contributors are Allen Anderson, Andy Bannister, Ruth Bradby, Keith Ferdinando, Theodore Gabriel, Chris Gnanakan, Willam Kay, Bill Musk, Martin Parsons, Chris Partridge, Peter Riddell, Nigel Scotland and Amy Summers-Minette.

În acest sens, memoria intervine ca trăsătură proprie obiectului arhitectural şi sunt discutate câteva instanţe ale acestei capacităţi memorializante a obiectului de arhitectură, mai cu seamă a celui religios.

Within its boundaries, there is an incomparable diversity of cultures, socio-economic standards and political structures. And all the world’s major religions—Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Christianity—have their origins in Asia. Little wonder that religion is always involved in the flash points that occur across the region.     Religious freedom and religious persecution know no boundaries and are alive and well in all their complexions from Korea in the north to Indonesia in the south, from the Philippines in the east to Pakistan in the west.     And UCAN has reporters and analysts across Asia’s full extent. We have brought our unique network to the task of examining and the evaluating the prospects for religious freedom and the causes of religious persecution in Asia.     As rational beings, we humans actualize our highest capacity when we make choices. For that exercise we need freedom. At the heart of all freedoms—political, economic and cultural especially—is the freedom to believe. Religious freedom is the fundamental freedom. Belief and its restriction attack the heart of freedom.     But the circumstances and conditions of religious freedom and the persecution of believers vary greatly across the continent. The range and reach of those circumstances and conditions across Asia are what this volume offers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Muslim law developed a clear legal cadre for dhimm?s, inferior but protected non-Muslim communities (in particular Jews and Christians) and Roman Canon law decreed a similar status for Jewish and Muslim communities in Europe. Yet the theoretical hierarchies between faithful and infidel were constantly brought into question in the daily interactions between men and women of different faiths in streets, markets, bath-houses, law courts, etc. The twelve essays in this volume explore these tensions and attempts to resolve them. These contributions show that law was used to try to erect boundaries between communities in order to regulate or restrict interaction between the faithful and the non-faithful?and at the same time how these boundaries were repeatedly transgressed and negotiated. These essays explore also the possibilities and the limits of the use of legal sources for the social historian.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A brief historical overview is followed by discussions of the oral and written origins of Hinduism that give context for the main emphasisocontemporary thought, practice, and key issues. Unique to this work is the consistent attention given to the practice of Hinduism for both men and women.What roles do caste and gender play in modern Hinduism? How are issues like ethics and the environment approached? What are the differences between urban and rural Hinduism, fundamental and secular Hinduism? To what countries has this religion spread, and how do the beliefs and practices of their people compare and contrast? Essays written by Indian and Western scholars answer these and other intriguing questions, introducing readers to the whole world of ""living Hinduism"" rather than the perspectives and traditions of a small elite.

Nirgendwo sonst finden wir in der antiken Welt ein so eindrückliches und vielschichtiges Zusammenspiel von Architektur, Dekoration und Raumfunktion wie hier; insbesondere gilt dies für die Kultbauten der Ptolemäer- und Römerzeit.0019 Beiträge widmen sich verschiedenen Aspekten dieser rituellen Räume, die aus Texten und Darstellungen konstruiert sind und sich auf dem steinernen Gebäude materialisieren. Im Fokus stehen dabei die Leitlinien in der Architektur der späten Tempel, die übergeordneten Muster in der Anbringung bestimmter Dekorationsinhalte an bestimmten Stellen des Gebäudes, die Hintergründe für die Vernetzung von Texten, die Wechselbeziehung zwischen ritueller Praxis und Ausgestaltung der Kultarchitektur sowie Fallstudien zu den Gestaltungsprinzipien spezieller Räume. Überdies beschäftigen sich die Beiträge mit den möglichen Interferenzen zwischen den grossen offiziellen Tempeln und der kultischen Praxis im ?privaten? rituellen Raum, der Einbindung von Elementen der 'sacred landscape' Ägyptens in die lokale Theologie und mit Aussagen über den Kultbau und seine Bestandteile aus Sicht der Ägypter.

Norman Geisler, along with Ronald Brooks, shows how Christians can greatly improve their thinking skills. ""To learn the rules of clear and correct thinking,"" the authors maintain, ""is more than an academic exercise. For the Christian, it is also a means of spiritual service"" since ""the principles of good reason flow from God's very nature."" - Back cover.

GENETICS AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS,CELIA DEANE-DRUMMOND,religion,First published in 2005,/works/OL13623463W,/authors/OL6480945A/CELIA_DEANE-DRUMMOND,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS|Language Undetermined,"In the immediate future we are likely to witness significant developments in human genetic science. It is therefore of critical importance that Christian ethics engages with the genetics debate, since it affects not just the way we perceive ourselves and the natural world, but also has wider implications for our society. This book considers ethical issues arising out of specific practices in human genetics, including genetic screening, gene patenting, gene therapy, genetic counselling as well as feminist concerns. Genetics and Christian Ethics argues for a particular theo-ethical approach that derives from a modified version of virtue ethics, drawing particularly on a Thomistic understanding of the virtues, especially prudence or practical wisdom and justice. The book demonstrates that a theological voice is highly relevant to contested ethical debates about genetics.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Not only have Christians always lived in Palestine, but more important, since the fourth century Christians gradually came to see Palestine as a Holy Land and Jerusalem as the Christian city. In this authoritative and accessible book, Robert L. Wilken discusses how Palestine became a Holy Land to Christians and how Christian ideas and feelings toward the land of the Bible evolved as they lived there and made it their own. Drawing on both primary texts and archaeological evidence, Wilken traces the Christian conception of a Holy Land from its origins in the Hebrew Bible to the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in the seventh century. - Jacket flap.

Is this acceptable to God? How is this ""good news""? Troubling questions -- so troubling that many have lost their faith because of them. Others only whisper the questions to themselves, fearing or being taught that they might lose their faith and their church if they ask them out loud. But what if these questions trouble us for good reason? What if the story of heaven and hell we have been taught is not, in fact, what the Bible teaches? What if what Jesus meant by heaven, hell, and salvation are very different from how we have come to understand them? What if it is God who wants us to face these questions? Author, pastor, and innovative teacher Rob Bell presents a deeply biblical vision for rediscovering a richer, grander, truer, and more spiritually satisfying way of understanding heaven, hell, God, Jesus, salvation, and repentance. The result is the discovery that the ""good news"" is much, much better than we ever imagined. Love wins. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|10 Have read

""In 1799, the papacy was at rock bottom: The Papal States had been swept away and Rome seized by the revolutionary French armies. With cardinals scattered across Europe and the next papal election uncertain, even if Catholicism survived, it seemed the papacy was finished.  In this gripping narrative of religious and political history, Paul Collins tells the improbable success story of the last 220 years of the papacy, from the unexalted death of Pope Pius VI in 1799 to the celebrity of Pope Francis today. In a strange contradiction, as the papacy has lost its physical power--its armies and states--and remained stubbornly opposed to the currents of social and scientific consensus, it has only increased its influence and political authority in the world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The three monotheistic faiths differ in demography, in the moment of their arrival on the continent and in the unequal relations they maintain with power: Christianity was chosen by a large number of inhabitants and became ? in spite of important differences according to place and time ?a religion of state. The organization of the continent into states and the divisions within Christianity often placed minorities in an unstable and at times painful situation. This partially explains the fight against ""heresies"", the wars of religions, the expulsion of Jews from several European kingdoms (as well as the expulsion of Muslims from Sicily and the Iberian peninsula), the ""Jewish question"" in the 19th century up until the Holocaust. Since the 20th century, the debates concerning Islam and concerning public expression of religion are shaped in part by this past. The 13 studies gathered in this volume explore the ways in which states have treated their religious minorities. We study various policies ? repression, supervision, integration, tolerance, secularization, indifference ? as well as the many ways in which minorities have accommodated the majority?s demands. The relation is by no means one-sided: on the contrary, state policies have created resistance, negotiation (on the legal, political, and cultural fronts) or compromise. Through these precise and original examples, we can see how the protagonists (states, religious institutions, the elite, the faithful) interact, try to convince or influence each other in order to transform practices, invent and implement common norms and grounds, all the while knowing the confessional dimension of ""religious"" majority and minority does not fully embrace the identity of each citizen in full.

Cuando un viento interminable de crisis debilita los pilares institucionales, la fe parece ser el mejor o el único punto de apoyo para muchas personas. Esto es lo que ha ocurrido desde finales del siglo pasado en casi todo México, donde ha surgido una buena cantidad de santos populares en los cuales miles de personas han depositado su esperanza de encontrar un manto protector. En esta investigación, José Gil Olmos --autor de Los brujos del poder-- se da a la tarea de rastrear a esas peculiares figuras religiosas para presentar una visión de conjunto de un complejo fenómeno social. Prólogo de Javier Sicilia  Popular saints of current times like the kid Fidencio, Jesus Malverde, and the terrible Saint Nazario, or even Emiliano Zapata are reborn in the mists of a national crisis where, thousands of people who feel lost, find a sense of refuge and hope in these saints. . When a never-ending wave of crisis weakens the institutional pillars, people's faiths seem to be the best, or the only, sense of strength and support for many people. This is what has happened in Mexico in the last part of the last century, there has been a wave of new popular saints arising on whom thousands of people have been placing their hopes for protection. In this investigative work, José Gil Olmos takes to the task of find these popular new saints and present them as part of a social phenomenon.

In fifteen clearly written and insightful essays, distinguished scholars of different faiths and divergent world views guide readers toward an informed understanding of the role of religion and the basic teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks on the United States. Acknowledging commonalities, these essays also shed light on the essential differences among the teachings of the Abrahamic traditions and raise pivotal questions regarding humanity's future: What prompted the carnage? What has changed since then? What remains to be achieved? Dispelling ignorance about the religious other is a necessary but only a first step toward achieving a durable and effective trialogue. In an increasingly perilous and interconnected world where the effects of globalization are yet to be fully recognized, interfaith trialogue holds out the hope of genuine movement toward a more peaceful coexistence.

The author tackles the question of why the great outlay of human and material resources over the centuries has not produced a greater receptivity to the gospel. He seeks answers in the theological categories of missio Dei, ecclesia Dei, and regnum Dei. Biblical, doctrinal, and theological considerations as well as church history and reformation history inform this study. Where does mission originate? What is God s intent for the church? As God comes into the world in love, what does his coming look like? Where does one find God s presence and how does one discern and build on that presence? These important questions for the articulation of mission are the foci of this book.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was mandated to go beyond truth-finding and to “promote national unity and reconciliation in a spirit of understanding which transcends the conflict and divisions of the past.” In contrast with other truth commissions, the TRC was led by clerics rather than lawyers and judge, and the TRC’s approach to reconciliation was shaped by and imbued with religious content. The TRC submitted its final report to the Mandela administration in October 1998.Over the next two years, the Rev. Bernard Spong, former communications director of the South African Council of Churches, conducted a series of in-depth interviews about the TRC with 33 key religious figures. In this volume, they discuss and evaluate the following issues:How should we understand the concept of national or political reconciliation and its requirements? What are the differences and similarities between religious and political approaches to reconciliation? Does national or political reconciliation require forgiveness between former victims and perpetrators? What is the appropriate role of religious representatives in a truth commission process? And is it recommended that other countries emulate the South African model? How do religious leaders assess the contributions and limitations of the TRC? What kind of initiatives are contemporary religious communities taking to promote reconciliation among their members and in the wider society? The conversations presented in this volume, and the essays interpreting them, seek to illuminate issues and questions raised by the TRC model, including how to conceptualize reconciliation and the differences between political and religious approaches.HighlightsProvides a key resource for policy makers, clergy, students, and lay people interested in forgiveness and reconciliation Originates from a multidisciplinary study with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society Includes interviews, extensive notes, and index   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The New Communitarians and the Crisis of Modern Liberalism,Bruce P. Frohnen,religion,First published in 1996,/works/OL2989202W?edition=ia%3Anewcommunitarian0000froh,/authors/OL457836A/Bruce_P._Frohnen,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL815868M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1996|Publisher  University Press of Kansas|Language English|Pages 271,"This book critiques and challenges the rise of communitarian thought in America. With a skeptical eye, Bruce Frohnen seeks to cut through the communitarians' rhetoric of community, commitment, and spirituality to reveal the egalitarian materialism at the core of their enterprise.  Frohnen argues that the ""new communitarians""—exemplified by political philosophers Charles Taylor and William Galston, as well as popularizers like Bill Clinton, Amitai Etzioni, Garry Wills, Mario Cuomo, and Robert Bellah—are actually old liberals trying to salvage political legitimacy by advocating allegiance to the ""sacred"" state rather than the traditions of family, church, and community.  Frohnen chastises the communitarians for confiscating the language of religion for purely political ends-a calculating attempt to rescue their thinly disguised liberalism from its own morally bankrupt decline. In effect, he criticizes what he perceives as the communitarians' misguided attempts to displace religion from the center of moral education and political life in the quest for an unachievable secular utopia. Their sacramental politics seek to harness awe and the impulse to worship in the service of the state. Frohnen, however, suggests that this effort has only served to further damage the relationship between tradition and belief on which our society is truly based.  Like the old liberals, the new communitarians continue to distort liberalism's original enterprise of freeing individuals from the constraints of tyrannical government. Instead, they advocate increasing government constraints to protect us from poverty and other material conditions that prevent us from leading our own version of the good life. Unfortunately, Frohnen contends, this attempt undermines the soul of self-reliance that provides the virtuous foundation of liberal economics, and, indeed, any good life lived in common.  Like Frohnen's first book, Virtue and the Promise of Conservatism, this volume is a tempered but resolute defense of traditional values and institutions confronting the rationalistic and materialistic excesses of a faithless age. In the dark night of the American soul, it flashes a warning to us that the ""bridge is out"" and we had better turn back or risk plunging into blackwater chaos.

C'est pourquoi les textes reunis ici ont ete juges aptes, à ouvrir une reflexion serieuse et methodique sur la religion et la culture en Afrique au seuil du 21eme siecle. Les contributions reunies dans ce volume s'ouvrent par une interrogation et, plutôt que de se fermer, elles se terminent par une ouverture sur des horizons de recherche. Il y a là de quoi ouvrir et alimenter les enquêtes que seuls ou en groupes structures les specialistes des sciences de l'homme sont invites à imaginer et conduire sur la religion et la culture de l'Afrique d'aujourd'hui. Claiming its culture, demanding its right to cultural diversity, or proclaiming its membership of a group of believers and taking possession of the flag of that belief in order to perpetrate actions that are then called ""holy"", to terrorize its fellows by imposing on them His vision of things and his law, are undoubtedly two of the most worrying features of the entry of our societies in the twenty-first century. For this reason, the texts gathered here have been deemed fit, to open a serious and methodical reflection on religion and culture in Africa at the threshold of the 21st century.""--Page 4 of cover.

The only serious issue about it is the missing pages (142 and 143 do not appear in my copy). This is quite frustrating, but it may be better than paying 100 € for an old edition...

Prostřednictvím rozboru nejdůležitějších textů evropské a americké provenience (Berger, Luckmann, Wilson, Martin, Bellah, Fenn, Dobbelaere, Bruce) autor sleduje ústřední otázku: Do jaké míry je sekularizace nevyhnutelným osudem moderního světa?

A téma aktualitását az adja, hogy a kulturális fordulatok jegyében zajló művészeti és vallási jelenségek értelmezése során egyre gyakrabban és a legkülönfélébb kontextusokban fordul elő a szent, a szakrális, a transzcendens fogalma.  Ez a jelenség az alapfogalmak újragondolására késztette azt a közel hatvan szerzőt (előadót), akiknek rövid bemutatását a kötet végén találhatja meg az olvasó. Az irodalom, zene, képzőművészet, film, színház, vallástudomány, kulturális antropológia, teológia, folklorisztika, esztétika, nyelv-, kommunikáció- és médiatudomány területén elért új kutatási eredmények bemutatásán kívül a különböző vallások és kultúrák megismeréséhez kapcsolódó metanyelven íródott tanulmányoknak is teret ad a kiadvány, amelynek színes képekkel illusztrált, bőséges jegyzetanyaggal kísért fejezeteit irodalomjegyzék egészíti ki.

It is the keystone of all Christian religions and yet continues to be shrouded in mystery. It has remained a paradox, an unsolvable conundrum...until now.  In this book the author parts the veil of mystery, and, perhaps for the first time, presents answers to the most profound questions concerning the atonement:   Why was the atonement of Christ necessary? Where did the atonement actually occur?   What exactly happened to Christ during the atonement? Why did Christ shed his blood?   How does the atonement actually work? How were people forgiven of their personal sins before the atonement occurred?   How is the law's demand for Justice and our need for Mercy resolved? How do we solve the paradox of faith and works? Is Christ's atonement enough, or must we, like Paul admonishes, work out our salvation with fear and trembling?    This book is not for the weak in faith. Be prepared to have your understanding of the atonement challenged and your knowledge of the truth expanded. In the end, you will be enriched, enlightened, and inspired to work even harder to increase your faith in God and Christ.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Enjoy her experiences and life enriching friendships with the  staff who worked for her family.  I have met the author and have spent time with her, and know there is much gleaned from actual people in her life intermingled with fiction. She is an excellent author, writing from her heart, not for a dollar, but to share a legacy for future family and others.  There is a rewritten version of this story that I worked on corrections and such. I think it has been put on a back burner and may never be printed. It continues the story and is heartbreaking but riveting. Audrey is a wonderful writer whose path through life has many detours, and some areas may not get revisited, due to time constraints. Enjoy this book and learn about the ""beechos"" and other treats she has shared with us.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We might think that consciousness and free will give us control over our lives but our minds are unpredictable places. We are susceptible to forces we don't understand. We are capable of inflicting immense cruelty on one another and yet we also have the capacity to be tender, to empathise, to feel. In his thought-provoking new book Richard Holloway holds a mirror up to the human condition. By drawing on a colourful and eclectic selection of writings from history, philosophy, science, poetry, theology and literature, Holloway shows us how we can stand up to the seductive power of the monster and draw closer to the fierce challenge of the saint.

As Westerman stands at its foot it poses both a physical and a religious challenge: where is the God from my children's bible? Who or what has taken his place? Can one free oneself of a religious upbringing?He meets geologists, priests, and, on the mountain's high slopes, an expedition in search of the Ark's remains. And also a Russian astronaut who observes that 'there is something between heaven and earth about which we humans know nothing'. Ararat is a dazzling, highly personal book about science, religion and all that lies between, by one of Europe's most celebrated young writers.

In addition it addresses topics of significant importance that similar books often ignore, including the argument for atheism from hiddenness, the coherence of the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation, and the relationship between religion and politics.

Open-mindedness in philosophy of religion,Gregory E.

Just what exactly is it, however, to keep an open-mind? How does open-mindedness function? How does it square with important personal commitments? These issues are particularly acute when it comes to matters of religious belief in which open-mindedness can sound to the pious a bit too much like doubt. Certainly, in a discipline whose discourse remains rational dialogue, effort should be spend discerning the contours of this viture, especially in light of its formal role in establishing responsiveness to new inquiries in matters philosophical and religious. This book provides a collection of essays serving to promote conversation about open mindedness, its virtue (or lack thereof), and its role and application in problems in the philosophy of religion in particular--back cover.

Mit Blick auf das Kerngeschäft der emanzipierten sozialen Felder 'Kunst' und 'Religion' lassen sich derartige Verhältnisbestimmungen heute theoretisch treffen. Wo aber Religionspraxis sich jenseits der Kirchen etabliert, wo die Grenzen von Kunstraum und Alltagswelt unscharf werden, wo sich in offenen Netzwerken Akteure und Akteurinnen mit differierendem Selbstverständnis verknüpfen, entstehen eigenwillige Resonanzen zwischen heterogenen symbolischen Ordnungen. Diese hybriden Formen geben den Beiträgen des Bandes Anlass, neu über gegenwärtige Relationen von Kunst, Kunsthandwerk und Religion nachzudenken.
