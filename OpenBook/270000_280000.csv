The goldwatcher,John Katz,finance,First published in 2008,/works/OL11914234W?edition=ia%3Agoldwatcherdemys0000katz,/authors/OL5113307A/John_Katz,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16754369M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Wiley|Language English,"Why did the price of gold hit record highs in 2008? Take a look at the headlines - government bailouts of failed banks, mortgage and credit crises, rising inflation, slowing growth and global insecurity. In order to protect themselves from treacherous financial markets and depreciated paper currencies investors worldwide are turning to gold.   Gold has long been used as money and as a store of wealth, but what's the source of its value? Why does that value sometimes rise so high and at other times fall so low? And what do we know about gold's complex and often tumultuous past that may yield clues about how it may behave in the future?   Gold is a side show on a world financial stage dominated by the dollar. The tail can't wag the dog -gold prices are affected by changes in prospects for the dollar and not vice versa. With uncertain outcomes for the American and global economies, gold's stateless money franchise makes this book compelling reading.   ""John Katz is a clear eyed independent strategist and analyst with an extraordinary ability to get to grips with subjects ranging from biotechnology via alternative energy to commodities and gold. Uniquely for a commentator on gold he has no dogmas. To assess the risks and rewards that come with owning gold he introduces opinions from an impressive range of commentators, examines different scenarios that may play out on the world economic stage and highlights situations when owning gold makes sense and when it doesn't. To complete the picture Frank Holmes's contribution to The Goldwatcher explains the risks and rewards. The Goldwatcher has been written for 21st century investors. It will be an indispensable resource for responsible people from institutional money managers to private savers - whether the gold price moves up, down, or sideways.""  --Patrick H. Spencer, Managing Director, Head of Institutional Sales, Robert W. Baird Limited, London   ""Frank Holmes's stellar track record as a resource portfolio manager is a clear reflection of his understanding of the business, the markets and the factors that affect them. His success is as much about unearthing value as it is about creating an investment process that is religiously followed. If you want to succeed in your resource investment,this book is a must. It's all the more enjoyable because the writing style is easy-going,clear and understandable.""  --Pierre Lassonde, Former chairman, World Gold Council, and past president, Newmont Mining Corp   This book is also supported by The Goldwatcher blog - http://wwwthegoldwatcher.com, which addresses news and developments affecting gold and the dollar, updates statistical information and links with sources for data and commentary.

Major new developments are taking place, driven partly by the need to analyze financial data. The five papers in this book describe those new developments from various viewpoints and are intended to be an introduction accessible to readers from a range of backgrounds. The book arises out of the second Seminaire European de Statistique (SEMSTAT) held in Oxford in December 1994. This brought together young statisticians from across Europe, and a series of introductory lectures were given on topics at the forefront of current research activity. The lectures form the basis for the five papers contained in the book. The papers by Shephard and Johansen deal respectively with time series models for volatility, i.e. variance heterogeneity, and with cointegration. Clements and Hendry analyze the nature of prediction errors. A complementary review paper by Laird gives a biometrical view of the analysis of short time series. Finally Astrup and Nielsen give a mathematical introduction to the study of option pricing. Whilst the book draws its primary motivation from financial series and from multivariate econometric modelling, the applications are potentially much broader.

Domestic institutions and the bypass effect of financial globalization,Jiandong Ju,finance,First published in 2007,/works/OL12042695W,/authors/OL5203712A/Jiandong_Ju,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English|Pages 41,"""This paper proposes a simple model to study the relationship between domestic institutions - financial system, corporate governance, and property rights protection - and patterns of international capital flows. It studies conditions under which financial globalization can be a substitute for reforms of domestic financial system. Inefficient financial system and poor corporate governance in a country may be completely bypassed by two-way capital flows in which domestic savings leave the country in the form of financial capital outflows but domestic investment takes place via inward foreign direct investment. While financial globalization always improves the welfare of a developed country with a good financial system, its effect is ambiguous for a developing country with an inefficient financial sector/poor corporate governance. However, the net effect for a developing country is more likely to be positive, the stronger its property rights protection. This is consistent with the observation that developed countries are often more enthusiastic about capital account liberalization around the world than many developing countries. A noteworthy feature of this theory is that financial and property rights institutions can have different effects on capital flows.""--abstract.

This was most vividly illustrated during the global food crisis of 2007?9 when price spikes occurred for key staple food commodities?such as wheat, rice, maize, and soybeans. Given the variety of reactions by governments of countries experiencing similar food price shocks, the 2007?9 crisis offered an excellent natural experiment for generating knowledge on responses to price volatility in particular and on the political economy of agricultural policy-making more generally. This book contains the wealth of collaborative research by a global team of experts on food price policy?the research was undertaken on a sizeable group of low- and middle-income countries that were highly affected by the 2007?9 food crisis. The central aim of the study is to uncover which political economy factors?ranging from the constellation of different interest groups to the nature of political institutions?explain variations in policy responses across countries. The research output proves valuable for at least three target audiences. First, it can inform international organizations and donors about which types of policy interventions can mitigate price volatility and whether they are feasible given a country?s political economy context. Second, it can help national policy makers better understand the trade-offs of certain policy interventions. Third, it generates much-needed further knowledge about the agricultural policy-making process in developing countries, which remains incredibly scarce despite the importance of agriculture to these countries? economies.

""Reviewing global financial crises since 1980, Wolf lays bare the links between the microeconomics of finance and the macroeconomics of the balance of payments, demonstrating how the subprime lending crisis in the United States fits into a pattern that includes the economic shocks of 1997, 1998, and early 1999 in Latin America, Russia, and Asia. He explains why the United States is now the ""borrower and spender of last resort,"" makes the case that this is an untenable arrangement, and argues that global economic security depends on the ability of emerging economies to develop robust financial systems based on domestic currencies."" ""Sharply and clearly argued, Wolf’s prescription for fixing global finance illustrates why he has been described as ""the world’s preeminent financial journalist.""""--BOOK JACKET.

There is, of course, an international context for these developments, but the Irish story – a story of extraordinary collusion between banks, regulators and the government – is perhaps unique in its tawdriness.This is the story Shane Ross – journalist, independent Senator, and long-time champion of citizens against misbehaving corporations – tells in The Bankers, going behind the scenes and the headlines to explain what happened, how it happened, and who made it happen. They're all here: Sean Fitzpatrick and the other bank bosses; Patrick Neary and the other members of Ireland's failed regulatory apparatus; the property developers, who dominated the banks' lending to a ruinous degree; and the politicians, who inflated the property bubble and haveallowed the banks to dictate the terms of their bailout to an astonishing degree. Shane Ross knows the stories of these people and what they got up to better than anyone, and in The Bankers he makes sense of a scandal that will haunt Ireland for years to come.

From the business's 19th Century beginnings in the jungles of Costa Rica, via the mass-marketing of the banana as the original fast food, United Fruit's involvement in bloody coups in Guatemala and El Salvador, the mid-1970s and the spectacular suicide on Park Avenue of the company's chairman, from its bullying business practices to its covert links to the US government, United Fruit blazed the trail of global capitalism through the 20th Century. Chapman weaves a dramatic tale of big business, lies and power to show how one company pioneered the growth of globalization and - in doing so - has helped farm the banana to the point of extinction.

A Blueprint for Better Banking,Niels Kroner,finance,First published in 2010,/works/OL15177914W,/authors/OL6815424A/Niels_Kroner,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24309734M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Harriman House|Language English,"'A Blueprint for Better Banking' takes a fresh look at the i¬?nancial crisis. It sets out to answer specifically what the mistakes were that banks made and how this could have been avoided. What is unique about this book is a detailed description of a large bank that operates very differently from its peers and that has, as a result, steered clear of the areas that have brought many other banks into trouble. This provides a number of insights into how a more resilient, post-credit crunch banking system should look.The first section begins with an overview of existing explanations of the crisis and why they remain partly unsatisfactory. It then sets out an alternative framework based around seven behavioural patterns of imprudent banking. These 'Seven Deadly Sins' have caused most banking crises, including the current one, and while they come in different shapes and forms they remain essentially the same. This book examines why they remain extremely tempting to bankers, often with the enthusiastic support of their shareholders and no meaningful objection by regulators.The second and main part of the book is a new and extensive description of the management practices at Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the top 25 banks in Europe. It not only survived the Swedish banking crisis in the 1990s without asking for support, but it has also remained stable during the latest crisis. Handelsbanken did not have to raise capital or ask for government support and its shares have been the best performing European bank stock by a wide margin.The bank has traditionally been run by management practices that are diametrically opposed to so-called 'best practice' in the industry. The book investigates how Handelsbanken operates without bonuses and examines their unique organisation, strategy discussion, risk management and capital markets communication. In effect, the book describes how Handelsbanken ensures that it does not fall for any of the Seven Deadly Sins. Niels Kroner has conducted over fifty interviews with Handelsbanken executives and competitors, and also draws on his inside experience of many other institutions to bring out the important differences between the 'Handelsbanken way' and common practices at other banks.The final part summarises what other banks and financial institutions can learn from Handelsbanken and how its model may offer a solution that other potential regulatory changes may not.

In a review of the literature Ryan (1997) discusses five motivations for relating accounting research to measures of systematic risk: (i) the development of more efficient ex post risk measures, (ii) the determination of actual risk determinants rather than just determining the level of risk, (iii) overcoming the problem that conventional ex-post measures cannot be used for non-listed entities,  initial public offering firms, or those that do not have sufficient trading history, (iv) as instrumental variables to reduce the noise found in traditional risk estimates that rely on historical security returns, and (v) the development of trading strategies and the construction of portfolios with the desired level of risk. Ubiquitous risk faces firms and intensifies in global economy. A success business not only centers on profit, but also on proper risk management. Risk and return go together and return maximization is constrained by risk. Firm risk has the systemic and unsystematic components. Portfolio theory suggests that unsystematic risk can be diversified away while systematic risk remains. How to control systematic risk through proper identification of its determinants thus becomes imperative for successful risk management and to investment decision. The finance literature suggests that systematic risk has external and internal factors. This e-book aims to advance the debate in this area and build on the existing literature.

The era of stochastic calculus is over and the time of Ito derivation is at an end. Today, quants need a broad modeling skillset - one that transcends mathematics to price and hedge financial products safely and effectively, but that also takes into account that we now live in a world of more frequent crises, fatter tail risk and the optimized search for alpha.  This book brings together proven and new methodologies from finance, physics and engineering, along with years of industry and academic experience to provide a cookbook of models for dealing with the challenges of today's markets. It begins by looking at approaches to vanilla and exotic options - including barrier, binary and American options. It then addresses the Black-Scholes conundrum - is it effective? The book then progresses to look at other pricing and valuation models commonly used in the industry, including Terminal Smile, stochastic volatility and more before confronting all the key challenges in model calibration and implementation.  Written for quantitative practitioners in banks and asset managers, Quantitative Finance provides a toolkit and robust methodology to confront new and unforeseen pricing and valuation challenges in the light of the new paradigm.

We use a heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with competitive financial intermediaries who can observe households' earnings, age and current asset holdings to evaluate several commonly offered explanations. We find that increased uncertainty (income shocks, expense uncertainty) cannot quantitatively account for the rise in bankruptcies. Instead, the rise in filings appears to mainly reflect changes in the credit market environment. We find that credit market innovations which cause a decrease in the transactions cost of lending and a decline in the cost of bankruptcy can largely accounting for the rise in consumer bankruptcy. We also argue that the abolition of usury laws and other legal changes are unimportant.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I establish a series of theoretical results describing the producer's behavior.  First, I find the conditions under which she prefers to set a plan for the price she charges, or instead prefers to set a plan for the quantity she sells.  Second, I show that the agent rationally chooses to be inattentive to news, only sporadically updating her information.  I solve for the optimal length of inattentiveness and characterize its determinants.  Third, I explicitly aggregate the behavior of many such producers.  I apply these results to a model of inflation.  I find that the model can fit the quantitative facts on post-war inflation remarkably well, that it is a good forecaster of future inflation, and that it survives the Lucas critique by fitting also the pre-war facts on inflation moderately well""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

No evidence suggests that larger firms are particularly innovative; in many specifications, there is a disproportionate representation of smaller firms among the innovators.  Less profitable firms and those with stronger academic ties also innovate more.  The elasticity of innovation with respect to size appears to have increased sharply since the State Street decision that greatly accelerated the rate of financial patenting.  I conclude by exploring how the origins of financial patents resemble or differ from those of innovations""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Fully-collateralized commodity futures have historically offered the same return and Sharpe ratio as equities.  While the risk premium on commodity futures is essentially the same as equities, commodity futures returns are negatively correlated with equity returns and bond returns.  The negative correlation between commodity futures and the other asset classes is due, in significant part, to different behavior over the business cycle.  In addition, commodity futures are positively correlated with inflation, unexpected inflation, and changes in expected inflation""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

A price equation is dervied from profit maximization and includes the wage expectations of the entrepreneurs. A wage equation is based on the Phillips function and includes the price expectations of labor. A price-wage equilibrium is defined as self-fulfilling expectations. The existence and the properties of such an equilibrium are examined. Policy conclusions are drawn. Finally, the paper determines the extent to which Wiksellian, Keynesian, and monetarist ideas may coexist in neoclassical growth.""

This term is inserted using a third degree polynomial distributed lag of four quarters that allows not only for some immediate impact on the consumer price index (e.g. through gasoline prices), but also for a delayed impact as crude oil prices affect production costs, wage rates, and eventually final goods prices.  Since increase in crude oil prices appear to be a continuing source of exogenous shocks on the system, simulations are presented that estimate the net effect of these increases; in this case of the 14.5% increase announced by OPEC for 1979 on the remaining quarters in 1979 and 1980. If OPEC policies, Iranian developments, or domestic U.S. policies should raise crude oil prices by an additional 10%, the net effect is estimated to raise the inflation rate by 0.9% above what it would otherwise be.""

The emergence of new consumers in China, India, Russia and the Middle East has added formidable competition to the natural resources that have been taken for granted in the developed world.   Everything we consume involves the use of metals, fossil fuels or agriculture. Our high tech 'lifestyles' depend on the secure supply of these raw materials which we take from planet earth and use to make our lives more comfortable, more productive or more manageable. The effect of this increasing global demand for commodities has pushed up prices of materials from oil and copper to corn and wheat; forcing consumers to pay more for the many 'necessities' of life, from a loaf of bread to electricity bills.   Since the commodity boom has unfolded, commodities have gone from the back page of the newspaper to the front; with more and more headlines about record food and oil prices, dire climate change warnings, energy security and China's demand for more raw materials.   This era of high oil and food prices is no passing phase: The supply of many key natural resources is stretched to the limit. But what is the real cost?   Living in a Material World makes the link between raw materials and the consumer, and shows how they are relevant to everybody, everyday - now more so than at any time since the last oil shock nearly three decades ago. A unique insight into this 'once in a generation' boom, the book shows how the increasing value of commodities is impacting on consumers and investors, in ways we are only just beginning to understand.   ""It was a great pleasure to read this book which provides an essential background to understanding commodities for anybody interested in understanding them more closely. It is so rare to see all the essential elements brought together in one book.""  --Chris Brodie, Krom River Partners LLP   ""Kevin Morrison set out to write a book about the daily relevance that raw materials have for the ordinary consumer. He has achieved his objective par excellence. The subject matter has been comprehensively researched and well documented - yet the writer has avoided using complicated technical language. The style of the book is more in tune with a novel and the main topics are treated with a special sense of humour. I would readily recommend this work to anyone interested in how global energy issues have a direct affect on us all.""  --Mehdi Varzi, President, Varzi Energy, London   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Fabozzi, Kolm, Pachamanova, and Focardi deserve high praise for producing a technically rigorous yet remarkably accessible guide to the latest advances in portfolio construction.""  --Mark Kritzman, President and CEO, Windham Capital Management, LLC    ""The topic of robust optimization (RO) has become 'hot' over the past several years, especially in real-world financial applications. This interest has been sparked, in part, by practitioners who implemented classical portfolio models for asset allocation without considering estimation and model robustness a part of their overall allocation methodology, and experienced poor performance. Anyone interested in these developments ought to own a copy of this book. The authors cover the recent developments of the RO area in an intuitive, easy-to-read manner, provide numerous examples, and discuss practical considerations. I highly recommend this book to finance professionals and students alike.""  --John M.

He has the extremely rare and enviable knack of making economics relevant, accessible and, most importantly of all, interesting. And Ross is a man on a mission. He wants to help us to understand just how the economy around us works, and more importantly, to help us take control of our lives, do less of what doesn't satisfy us and more of what does. Sound simple? Sound appealing? You bet.While the very word 'economics' strikes fear in the hearts of many, as the great English economist Alfred Marshall puts it, economics is the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life. And it's this ordinary business of life that Ross Gittins wants to explain to us: be it to do with work, leisure and the shortage of time; homes and housework; buying and saving; parents and their kids; kids and their education; not to mention our happiness and the things that may threaten it - crime, taxation, health and ageing. Economics is the stuff of life, our life, and we need to understand it. Written in his trademark friendly and accessible style, Gittinomics sums up all the things Ross wants to share with us after more than 30 years as an acclaimed economic journalist on The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Gittinomics is for everyone who's never really understood economics, but was too embarrassed to admit it. Go on, what have you got to lose?

The ""top down"" approach to behavioral finance focuses on the measurement of reduced form, aggregate sentiment and traces its effects to stock returns. It builds on the two broader and more irrefutable assumptions of behavioral finance -- sentiment and the limits to arbitrage -- to explain which stocks are likely to be most affected by sentiment. In particular, stocks of low capitalization, younger, unprofitable, high volatility, non-dividend paying, growth companies, or stocks of firms in financial distress, are likely to be disproportionately sensitive to broad waves of investor sentiment.

A. Hayek’s long-overlooked volume, was his most detailed work in economic theory. Originally published in 1941 when fashionable economic thought had shifted to John Maynard Keynes, Hayek’s manifesto of capital theory is now available again for today’s students and economists to discover.  With a new introduction by Hayek expert Lawrence H. White, who firmly situates the book not only in historical and theoretical context but within Hayek’s own life and his struggle to complete the manuscript, this edition commemorates the celebrated scholar’s last major work in economics. Offering a detailed account of the equilibrium relationships between inputs and outputs in an economy, Hayek’s stated objective was to make capital theory ""useful for the analysis of the monetary phenomena of the real world.” His ambitious goal was nothing less than to develop a capital theory that could be fully integrated into the business cycle theory.

With the narrative flair and talent for decoding financial ambiguities that readers have come to rely on, Lowenstein brilliantly chronicles three fascinating pension cases: the collapse of the over-obligated General Motors, the pension strike that halted New York City's subways and effectively shut down the city, and the scandalous bankrupting of the affluent corner of Southern California, the city of San Diego. Not only compelling historical sagas rich with detail and unforgettable characters, each story also acts as an object lesson. Lowenstein warns that these pension wars are only the beginning of the retirement and healthcare crisis we will face if we don't find ways to address this latest moral hazard. Governments and corporations across the country used pensions as a seemingly easy way to curry favor with unions (easy because the expense would be deferred until a later generation). But now, with cumulative retirement deficits approaching $1 trillion, the day of reckoning has arrived.Is there a way out? Lowenstein recognizes that fixing pensions will be difficult but securing retirement is a critical issue?especially in our rapidly aging country?and he proposes a cogent solution to the impending crisis. Masterfully written and convincingly argued, While America Aged is a timely and crucial wake-up call to a pension damaged America.

What is a home equity loan? What are some of the steps to establishing the right goals for investing? What is diversification? What types of risks could we see if we own individual stocks? When did mutual funds start? What is laddering?

The book assesses the context of public budgeting in these governments, especially the legal foundations for its practice and how the process and final budgets are impacted by governance structures, laws, various budget actors and different branches of government. The author presents focused attention on the influences on government budgets of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, the bureaucracy, the public and the media.

Chapters cover the constitutional and statutory provisions for budgeting in selected governments.

Budget mechanics--budget types, formats, timelines and reforms--are introduced and compared. Taxes and intergovernmental revenues are considered, with predominant tax choices at every level of government in the United States and those in a select, developing country represented. The book introduces an emerging method for investigating the outcomes of government spending--human rights budget analysis--and includes as an example the assessment of budget reform and results of public health spending in one selected government.Highlights of Public Budgeting in Context  Offers a comprehensive text for understanding public budgeting in governments of a variety of contexts and capacities and across different levels  Written by a noted expert in the field of public budgeting and financial management  Contains illustrative examples from industrialized and developing countries  Guides to innumerable datasets with information about governments and their budgets  Includes a companion website filled with templates for budget and fiscal analysis  Unravel the complex issues of modern public budgeting using this unique presentation of its practice in a variety of governments in the U.S. and a select sample from around the world""--  ""This book examines budgeting at all levels of U.S. government--federal, state, and local--and in a sample of governments around the world.

Disinflation and fiscal reform,Roberto Rigobón,finance,First published in 2002,/works/OL5812036W,/authors/OL1423834A/Roberto_Rigobón,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""During the last two decades, many Latin American countries engaged in disinflation programs based on both exchange rate management and fiscal reforms.  However, in most instances, part of the fiscal reform was delayed or not implemented completely, so the fiscal deficit increased and the program had to be abandoned.  The aftermath of these programs is not encouraging, since most of these policies turned out to be failures, lowering reserves and causing higher inflation rates.  Given this record, it is worth asking why governments start a disinflation program even though the fiscal equilibrium is not guaranteed.  In this paper we show that, if the reform process is uncertain and inflation has welfare costs, the optimal exchange rate policy implies the initiation of a disinflation program at the announcement of the fiscal reform.  Additionally, we show that even if there exists a possibility of a balance of payments crisis, it is still optimal to initiate a disinflation program.  This means that, in this set up, avoiding the crisis with probability one is suboptimal.  Finally, we show that it is optimal to engage in a sequence of stabilization programs until one of them is successful""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Structural estimates of the U.S. sacrifice ratio,Stephen G.

We derive estimates of the sacrifice ratio from three structural VAR models and then conduct Monte Carlo simulations to analyze their sampling distribution.  While the point estimates of the sacrifice ratio confirm the results reported in earlier studies, we find that the estimates are very imprecise and that the degree of imprecision increases with the complexity of the model used.  That is, increases in the number of structural shocks widen our confidence intervals.  We conclude that the estimates provide a very unreliable guide for assessing the output cost of a disinflation policy""--Federal Reserve Bank of New York web site.

Core inflation,Alan Mankikar,finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL5892106W,/authors/OL1453214A/Alan_Mankikar,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  Bank of England|Language English,"""The term 'core inflation' is widely used by academics and central bankers. But despite its prevalence, there is neither a commonly accepted theoretical definition nor an agreed method of measuring it. The range of conceptual bases is potentially confusing, and can make the large number of available measures of core inflation difficult to interpret, particularly when they display different trends. Nevertheless, measures of core inflation can be helpful if they increase the signal to noise ratio in measured inflation. This paper examines a range of measures of core inflation for the United Kingdom, both conceptually and empirically, setting out their motivation and highlighting their potential limitations. No single measure performs well across the board, but a compromise conclusion on the usefulness of measures of core inflation is that each one may provide a different insight into the inflation process. There can be value in looking at a range of measures, as long as one bears in mind what information each type of indicator is best at providing. When all measures are giving the same message then, in a sense, monetary policy makers can reasonably consider that these measures are providing a reliable guide to inflationary pressures. It is when the measures start to diverge that policymakers need to take a much closer look at the reasons for those divergences""--Bank of England web site.

Improving the rules and institutions governing these activities should be a major component, therefore, of any development approach. Given that strengthening Public Financial Management (PFM) is at the heart of the Millennium Development Goals, and good governance more generally, the Paris Declaration (2005) seeks to promote joint efforts in this area between donors and partner countries. This report takes stock of progress in strengthening public financial management systems and provides recommendations on how best to facilitate achieving the 2010 targets set out in the Paris Declaration. It sets out the benefits of and rationale for using country systems, assesses progress in meeting the Paris Declaration targets, reviews the landscape of PFM reforms in partner countries, looks at drivers of successful PFM reforms, examines the factors that influence decisions to use country PFM systems, focusing on the perceived risks and their assessment and management, and describes the PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability) assessment, which provides information on the quality of a country’s PFM system. This report shows that now, as perhaps never before, partner countries and donors must strive to build mutual trust and work together in a true partnership for results.

Over the period 1973 to 2003, we find that U.S.  innovations have a large effect on inflation in the other countries, although they are not always the dominant international factor.  Similarly, shocks to some other countries also have a statistically and economically significant influence on U.S. inflation.  Moreover, our evidence indicates that U.S. inflation has become less vulnerable to foreign shocks since the early 1990s, mainly because of the diminished influence from Germany and France""--Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis web site.

A first assessment of some measures of core inflation for the euro area,Juan Luis Vega,finance,First published in 2002,/works/OL3655949W,/authors/OL627496A/Juan_Luis_Vega,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2002|Publisher  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Language English,"""Core inflation plays an important role in the deliberations of monetary policymakers. In this paper we evaluate a number of measures of core inflation constructed using euro area data. In addition to the traditional exclusion-type core measures, we examine two newer ones, documenting their properties and evaluating their performance in terms of their ability to track underlying or trend inflation in real time. We focus on core measures derived from the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) as the European Central Bank has chosen to define its mandate for price stability in terms of this index, and because this is the only index of consumer prices that is compiled in an comparable manner across all members of the European Union. We document significant excess kurtosis in the cross-section distribution of price changes in the euro area, and show that several categories of prices are more volatile than those typically excluded from traditional measures of core inflation. Contrary to what one might expect, traditional measures of core inflation are not significantly less volatile than headline measures. We document the superior performance of alternative measures of core inflation in tracking trend inflation on average, but show that none of the various measures of core gave significant advance warning of the pickup in trend inflation at the beginning of 1999""--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas web site.

Sources for financing domestic capital,Joshua Aizenman,finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL5889943W,/authors/OL1452712A/Joshua_Aizenman,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper proposes a new method for measuring the degree to which the domestic capital stock is self-financed.  The main idea is to use the national accounts to construct a self-financing ratio, indicating what would have been the autarky stock of tangible capital supported by actual past domestic saving, relative to the actual stock of capital.  We use the constructed measure of self-financing to evaluate the impact of the growing global financial integration on the sources of financing domestic capital stocks in developing countries.  On average, 90% of the stock of capital in developing countries is self financed, and this fraction was surprisingly stable throughout the 1990s.  The greater integration of financial markets has not changed the dispersion of self-financing rates, and the correlation between changes in de-facto financial integration and changes in self-financing ratios is statistically insignificant.  There is no evidence of any growth bonus' associated with increasing the financing share of foreign savings.  In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite: throughout the 1990s, countries with higher self-financing ratios grew significantly faster than countries with low self-financing ratios.  This result persists even after controlling growth for the quality of institutions.  We also find that higher volatility of the self-financing ratios is associated with lower growth rates, and that better institutions are associated with lower volatility of the self-financing ratios.  These findings are consistent with the notion that financial integration may have facilitated diversification of assets and liabilities, but failed to offer new net sources of financing capital in developing countries""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

His book Strategic Stock Trading demystifies the stock market by explaining what truly makes the stock market and individual stocks move the way they do and shows you how you can take advantage of it.  This book is designed to be a fast read that you can finish in one sitting.  After you buy this book and read it among the things you will learn are:  THE MOST PROFITABLE STOCK PATTERN YOU CAN BUY - The best traders and investors are one trick ponies who develop a method or trading strategy that they use over and over again to profit in the market. Instead of flooding you with hundreds of different technical analysis indicators Swanson cuts to the chase and hands you the most profitable stock pattern that he has used again and again over the years.  HOW TO BUY TOMORROW'S BIG WINNERS TODAY - Imagine what would it be like to be able to find the next Apple or the next world changing stock market sector? Learn how to break the stock market down in investment sub sectors and be able to identify when one of them is positioning itself to begin a new bull market of its own and become the next big thing everyone is talking about a year from now.  UNDERSTAND INVESTMENT CROWD PSYCHOLOGY - Individual investors play in the stock market and tend to buy high and sell low while hedge funds and professional investors are now dominating the exchanges with computer programs and short-term trading. As an individual investor Swanson shares his knowledge of what really moves professional investors to help you understand how to navigate today's stock market and play like a shark and not swim like a minnow.  PROFIT DURING BEAR MARKETS THROUGH SHORT SELLING - Swanson made money in the 2008 stock market crash by recognizing it was coming ahead of time and then betting against the stock market. After you read this book you will know what type of storm clouds come before big bear markets and how to short sell stocks the right way if you want to try to profit from them.  BUY A STOCK USING THE TWO-FOLD FORMULA - Price patterns and technical analysis are key in stock trading entry and exit points, but fundamental analysis using valuation metrics are key to evaluating he true investment potential in a stock. These simple valuation metrics will enable you to do this at a quick glance.  THIS IS THE BOOK MANY CONSIDER TO BE IDEAL FOR BOTH NEWBIES AND EXPERTS - To quickly tell you why many people consider this to be an important book there are many stock market and stock trading investment books that describe different aspects of technical and fundamental analysis. This one puts them together and shows you have to really use them in a strategic way backed by real life experiences and examples. It also discusses the psychology of investors in the market and how hedge funds and institutional investors now influence the stock market more than ever before and what you must do in this type of market to succeed. It is a practical and refreshingly compact guide.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Fitting local volatility,Andrey Itkin,finance,First published in 2020,/works/OL32272587W,/authors/OL7932564A/Andrey_Itkin,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  World Scientific|Language English|Pages 204,"""The concept of local volatility as well as the local volatility model are one of the classical topics of mathematical finance. Although the existing literature is wide, there still exist various problems that have not drawn sufficient attention so far, for example: a) construction of analytical solutions of the Dupire equation for an arbitrary shape of the local volatility function; b) construction of parametric or non-parametric regression of the local volatility surface suitable for fast calibration; c) no-arbitrage interpolation and extrapolation of the local and implied volatility surfaces; d) extension of the local volatility concept beyond the Black-Scholes model, etc. Also, recent progresses in deep learning and artificial neural networks as applied to financial engineering have made it reasonable to look again at various classical problems of mathematical finance including that of building a no-arbitrage local/implied volatility surface and calibrating it to the option market data. This book was written with the purpose of presenting new results previously developed in a series of papers and explaining them consistently, starting from the general concept of Dupire, Derman and Kani and then concentrating on various extensions proposed by the author and his co-authors. This volume collects all the results in one place, and provides some typical examples of the problems that can be efficiently solved using the proposed methods. This also results in a faster calibration of the local and implied volatility surfaces as compared to standard approaches. The methods and solutions presented in this volume are new and recently published, and are accompanied by various additional comments and considerations. Since from the mathematical point of view, the level of details is closer to the applied rather than to the abstract or pure theoretical mathematics, the book could also be recommended to graduate students with majors in computational or quantitative finance, financial engineering or even applied mathematics. In particular, the author used to teach some topics of this book as a part of his special course on computational finance at the Tandon School of Engineering, New York University""--Publisher's website   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The joy of financial security,Donna Skeels Cygan,finance,First published in 2013,/works/OL19706696W,/authors/OL7519252A/Donna_Skeels_Cygan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Language English|Pages 394,"Early in her financial planning career, Cygan noticed that clients who had healthy relationships with their money were much happier overall. Being rich didn't automatically lead to happiness, and being happy didn,t automatically lead to becoming wealthy; the relationship was much more complex. She devoted many years to researching and pondering the relationship between money and happiness, eventually deciding to share her findings in this book. She concluded that money doesn't buy happiness, but it definitely impacts it. The dilemma was to determine just how money impacts our happiness. The Joy of Financial Security is grounded in research, but it also includes personal stories from Cygan's clients and from her own upbringing. These stories make the advice authentic, and help the reader understand how to implement the financial advice and the happiness strategies into their own lives. She shows that taking control of your finances is not rocket science, and that anyone can become a wise investor–simply by developing a financial plan and using discipline to follow the plan. Topics such as money messages from your childhood, managing your human capital, good debt vs. bad debt, and a sustainable withdrawal rate during retirement are practical for anyone wanting to take their finances to a higher level.

Fiscal responsibility legislation and fiscal adjustment,Luiz de Mello,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL23987947W,/authors/OL629768A/Luiz_de_Mello,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  World Bank|Language English,"""This paper discusses trends in fiscal adjustment in Brazil since the 1990s, with particular emphasis on the strengthening of institutions for fiscal policymaking, and its effect on local government finances and their ability to invest in infrastructure building and upgrading.  Although fiscal adjustment, which is ongoing, has taken a toll on the government's ability to finance much-needed infrastructure investment, it is not the only culprit.  A lack of budget flexibility, against a backdrop of increasing downward rigidities in current spending, also constrains the government's ability to invest.  The paper argues that regulatory uncertainty in many sectors, particularly water and sanitation, in which the municipalities play a leading role, has discouraged private sector investment and that the financing of infrastructure building and upgrading goes beyond the municipal level of government.  Higher-level jurisdictions are responsible for financing investment in energy and transport infrastructure, for example. ""--World Bank web site.

Today people have to be ready for anything - they have to be resilient. And this book, by the leaders of the pioneering investment firm Natural Investing, proposes to increase our individual and collective resilience through a total rethinking of what personal investing means. Using their Resilient Investing Matrix you'll be able to see your assets in the widest possible terms, not only financial, but also personal (time, energy) and tangible (the things you own). Then the authors help you sort through a range of strategies for managing each of these assets, ideally to contribute to the best possible future, but also to be prepared for any possible future. This book will help you develop a plan for your life, not just your money. You'll be able to stay abreast of the changing world and participate in constructive ways, wherever it goes: to be part of the breakthroughs to a sustainable future, to prosper in a world that's muddling through, and to have foundations for sustenance and happiness if things start to fall apart.

Yet John Quincy Adams, Monroe's successor, seemed not to share the commitment to debt freedom, resulting in the rise of opposition to his administration and his defeat for reelection in the bitter presidential campaign of 1828. The new president, Andrew Jackson, was thoroughly committed to debt freedom, and when it was achieved, it became the only time in American history when the country carried no national debt. Lane shows that the great and disparate issues that confronted Jackson, such as internal improvements, the ""war"" against the Second Bank of the United States, and the crisis surrounding South Carolina's refusal to pay federal tariffs, become unified when debt freedom is understood as a core element of Jacksonian Democracy.--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Mothers can have both financial and family success. ""As a Mom Thinketh"" addresses the thinking that prevents mothers from obtaining their financial goals and shows them how to dream big and live wealthy while enjoying their children. Mothers need to know that it is acceptable to provide for themselves without guilt. Unfortunately, many women stop investing in themselves after they have children. This leaves moms tired, stressed, and depressed, with very little left to give to their families. Women accept this self-sacrificing role because they do not think they deserve better. ""As a Mom Thinketh"" shows mothers how they can live their dreams and have both family and financial success by developing a wealth mentality. ""As a Mom thinketh"" is a radical way to look at motherhood. There are many books on wealth and personal finance, but few of them tap into the minds of mothers and challenge them to change their ways of thinking. ""As a Mom Thinketh"" empowers mothers to reenergize themselves by pursuing their passions. Readers will learn: Seven money skills of CEO's that mothers can use to create wealth; Four simple steps to making money doing what you love; Nine mommy-benefits that can be negotiated at work; Three rules moms must know to win at playing the money game; Four reasons why mothers are a high-risk for poverty. The primary thrust of ""As a Mom Thinketh"" is to help moms understand that what is in their minds actually forms their reality. Mothers are taught wealth-building in a style that is non-threatening and fun. They learn how successful people think and how to tap into the ""millionaire mindset."" This book offers every mother (single, married, widowed, or divorced) a choice to change her circumstances for the better.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I embrace risk."" -Turtle trader Curtis FaithRisk is scary, to be sure, but it's a fundamental aspect of the investing world. Without it, profit would not exist. The trick is to accept, anticipate, manage, and mitigate risk. In other words, master it.In Way of the Turtle, Curtis Faith revealed the extraordinarily successful trading system of the now-famous group of investors known as the Turtles. Now, in this highly anticipated follow up to that bestseller, Faith delves deeply into the risk-mastery strategies that made the Turtles the envy of the investing world. Inside the Mind of the Turtles provides expert insight into how great traders combat the natural but counterproductive response to risk. Faith begins by examining the nature of risk and the human being's natural response to it. Then he outlines proven techniques for seizing control of it. You will learn how to:Make decisions under changing conditions of uncertaintyOrganize for flexibility and quick response to changeSet your main focus on acquiring gains--not avoiding lossesPlace equal importance on assets already spent and those still on handJudge the quality of decisions based on their inception rather than their outcomeAvoid drawing conclusions using too little informationYou'll find valuable advice not only from Faith, but from some of the greatest financial minds on the scene today, including fellow Turtle Jerry Parker, venture capitalist Simon Olson, and Howard Lindzon, founder of the popular Web site WallStrip. Use their collective advice, and you'll find yourself approaching risk in ways you never dreamed possible. In today's economy, controlling your aversion to risk is not just prudent--it's an absolute necessity. Economic turbulence more often than not leads to poor investment decisions.

The optimal way involves three elements: (1) an explicit central-bank commitment to a higher future price level; (2) a concrete action that demonstrates the central bank's commitment, induces expectations of a higher future price level and jump-starts the economy; and (3) an exit strategy that specifies when and how to get back to normal.  A currency depreciation is a direct consequence of expectations of a higher future price level and hence an excellent indicator of those expectations.  Furthermore, an intentional currency depreciation and a crawling peg, as in the Foolproof Way, can implement the optimal way and, in particular, induce the desired expectations of a higher future price level.  I conclude that the Foolproof Way is likely to work well for Japan, which is in a liquidity trap now, as well as for the euro area and the United States, in case either would fall into a liquidity trap in the future""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Reducing the risk of investment-based social security reform,"Feldstein, Martin S.",finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL2798795W,/authors/OL414856A/Feldstein_Martin_S.,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""This paper describes the risks implied by a mixed system of Social Security pension benefits with different combinations of pay-as-you-go taxes and personal retirement account (PRA) saving.  The analysis shows how these risks can be reduced by using alternative private market guarantee strategies.  The first such strategy uses a blend of equities and TIPS to guarantee at least a positive real rate or return on each year's PRA saving.  The second is an explicit zero-cost collar that guarantees an annual rate of return by giving up all returns above a certain level.  One variant of these guarantees uses a two stage procedure: a guaranteed return to age 66 and then a separate guarantee on the implicit return in the annuity phase.  An alternative strategy provides a combined guarantee on the return during both the accumulation and the annuity phase.Simulations are presented of the probability distributions of retirement incomes relative to the ""benchmark"" benefits specified in current law.  Calculations of expected utility show that these risk reduction techniques can raise expected utility relative to the plans with no guarantees.  The ability to do so depends on the individual%u2019s risk aversion level.  This underlines the idea that different individuals would rationally prefer different investment strategies and risk reduction options""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We discuss  how to implement the optimal policy with minimal information requirement and  evaluate the robustness of these simple rules when the central bank may not  know the exact sources of shocks or nominal rigidities.  A main finding is that  a simple hybrid rule under which the short-term interest rate responds to CPI  inflation and PPI inflation results in a welfare level close to the optimum,  whereas policy rules that ignore PPI inflation or PPI sector shocks can result  in significant welfare losses""--Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia web site.

Optimal inflation targeting under alternative fiscal regimes,Pierpaolo Benigno,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL5812084W,/authors/OL1423849A/Pierpaolo_Benigno,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""Standard discussions of flexible inflation targeting as an optimal monetary policy abstract completely from the consequences of monetary policy for the government budget.  But at least some of the countries now adopting inflation targeting have substantial difficulty in controlling fiscal imbalances, so that the additional strains resulting from strict control of inflation are of substantial concern, and some (notably Sims 2005) have argued that inflation targeting can even be counterproductive under some fiscal regimes.  Here, therefore, we analyze welfare-maximizing monetary policy taking explicit account of the consequences of monetary policy for the government budget, and under a variety of assumptions about the nature of the fiscal regime.  The paper contrasts the optimal monetary policies under three alternative assumptions about fiscal policy: (i) the case in which little distortion is required to raise additional government revenue, and the fiscal authority can be relied upon to ensure intertemporal government solvency [the implicit assumption in standard analyses]; (ii) the case in which only distorting sources of revenue exist, but distorting taxes are adjusted optimally; and (iii) the case in which tax rates cannot be expected to change in response to a change in monetary policy [the problematic case emphasized by Sims].  In both of cases (ii) and (iii), it is optimal for monetary policy to allow the inflation rate to respond to fiscal developments (and the optimal responses to other shocks are somewhat different than in the classic analysis, which assumes case (I)).  Nonetheless, optimal monetary policy can still be implemented through a form of flexible inflation targeting, and it remains critical, even in the most pessimistic case (case (iii)), that inflation expectations (beyond some very short horizon) not be allowed to vary in response to shocks""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

We use a fully articulated model to assess the relative contributions of deflation/monetary shocks, which are the most commonly cited shocks for the Depression, and productivity shocks.We find that productivity is the dominant shock, accounting for about 2/3 of the Depression, with the monetary shock accounting for about 1/3.The main reason deflation doesn't account for more of the Depression is because there is no systematic relationship between deflation and output during this period.Our finding that a persistent productivity shock is the key factor stands in contrast to the conventional view that a continuing sequence of unexpected deflation shocks was the major cause of the Depression.We also explore what factors might be causing the productivity shocks.We find some evidence that they are largely related to industrial activity, rather than agricultural activity, and that they are correlated with real exchange rates and non-deflationary shocks to the financial sector""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site.

The risk-adjusted cost of financial distress,Heitor Almeida,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5893127W,/authors/OL1453575A/Heitor_Almeida,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""In this paper we argue that risk-adjustment matters for the valuation of financial distress costs, since financial distress is more likely to happen in bad times.  Systematic distress risk implies that the risk-adjusted probability of financial distress is larger than the historical probability.  Alternatively, the correct valuation of distress costs should use a discount rate that is lower than the risk free rate.  We derive a formula for the valuation of distress costs, and propose two strategies to implement it.  The first strategy uses corporate bond spreads to derive risk-adjusted probabilities of financial distress.  The second strategy estimates the risk adjustment directly from historical data on distress probabilities, using several established asset pricing models.  In both cases, we find that exposure to systematic risk increases the NPV of financial distress costs.  In addition, the magnitude of the risk-adjustment can be very large, suggesting that a valuation of distress costs that ignores systematic risk significantly underestimates their true present value.  Finally, we show that marginal distress costs computed using our new formula can be large enough to balance the marginal tax benefits of debt derived by Graham (2000), and we conclude that systematic distress risk can help explain why firms appear rather conservative in their use of debt""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Youth tend to have small incomes and limited wants, with the result that many students spend the bulk of their income on only a few items.  Fast food, clothing and entertainment make up the majority of products purchased by teenagers.  The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that changes in the prices of the other goods commonly bought by teenagers will affect budget allocations and thereby affect the demand for substances.  We estimate own and cross price effects using the prices of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and other consumer products including gasoline, clothing, entertainment, and fast food.  Income effects are also estimated and show that teens with higher incomes and allowances are more likely to use substances.  The policy implications of the results are discussed""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These interest rates were accommodative by historical standards.  Nonetheless, inflation remained low.  How did the Fed succeed in sustaining rapid economic growth without fueling inflation and inflationary expectations? In retrospect, it is evident that the productive capacity of the economy increased.  Yet as events unfolded, there was uncertainty about the expansion of the capacity of the economy and therefore about the sustainability of the Fed's policy.  This paper provides an explanation for the success of the Fed in accommodating growth with stable inflation in the late 1990s.  It shows that if the central bank is committed to reverse policy errors it makes because of unwarranted optimism, inflation can remain in check even if the central bank keeps interest rates low because of this optimism.  In particular, a price level target which is a simple way to model a commitment to offset errors can serve to anchor inflation even if the public does not share the central bank's optimism about shifts in potential output.  The paper shows that price level targeting is superior to inflation targeting in a wide range of situations.  The paper also provides econometric evidence that, in contrast to earlier periods, the Fed has recently put substantial weight on the price level in setting interest rates.  Moreover, it shows that CPI announcement surprises lead to reversion in the price level.  Finally, it provides textual evidence that Alan Greenspan puts relatively more weight on the price level than inflation"" National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Just as the warriors of old rode out to battle with the confidence and knowledge to conquer new lands and foes, so do the warriors of the market who thrive on the battleground of the trading floor.   In Warrior Trading, Clifford Bennett, one of today's leading currency forecasters, outlines a path to trading success by highlighting the characteristics, the knowledge and skills, and the psychological state of mind required to be a true warrior trader. You'll be introduced to some fresh and unique perspectives regarding the markets, by looking at fundamental and technical analysis, as well as discovering how best to trade within the markets as an individual. Most importantly, you'll learn how to take advantage of those moments when the perceptions of most traders (the herd) are at odds with the underlying reality-moments when fear, greed, and other emotions wreak havoc on the ordinary trader's ability to operate objectively.   Divided into three comprehensive parts, Warrior Trading will show you how to develop the focus, attitude, and mental discipline of a top trader so that you can make the most out of your time in the markets.

Fiscal hedging and the yield curve,Hanno Lustig,finance,First published in 2005,/works/OL5889152W,/authors/OL1452592A/Hanno_Lustig,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""We identify a novel, fiscal hedging motive that helps to explain why governments issue more expensive, long-term debt.  We analyze optimal fiscal policy in an economy with distortionary labor income taxes, nominal rigidities and nominal debt of various maturities.  The government in our model can smooth labor tax rates by changing the real return it pays on its outstanding liabilities.  These changes require state contingent inflation or adjustments in the nominal term structure.  In the presence of nominal pricing rigidities and a cash in advance constraint, these changes are themselves distortionary.  We show that long term nominal debt can help a government hedge fiscal shocks by spreading out and delaying the distortions associated with increases in nominal interest rates over the maturity of the outstanding long-term debt.  After a positive spending shock, the government raises the yield curve and steepens it""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

The reason may be absence of commitment in monetary policy.  In a standard model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps, even without trigger strategies.  In these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions, which then make accommodating those expectations the optimal monetary policy.  Under commitment, the equilibrium is unique and the inflation rate is low on average.  This analysis suggests that institutions which promote commitment can prevent high inflation episodes from recurring""--Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis web site.

"Constitutions, corporations, and corruption",John Joseph Wallis,finance,First published in 2004,/works/OL5889805W,/authors/OL1452701A/John_Joseph_Wallis,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2004|Publisher  National Bureau of Economic Research|Language English,"""During the 1840s, twelve American states adopted new constitutions.  Eleven of the twelve states adopted new procedures for issuing government debt and for chartering corporations through general incorporation acts.  These institutional innovations were American inventions, and today hard budget constraints and transparent corporate forms with secure stockholder rights are important institutional determinants of successful economies.  This paper investigates how and why these two important institutional reforms occurred at precisely the same time.  The link is the public finance implications of chartering corporations and investing in large infrastructure projects in finance and transportation.  States borrowed almost $200 million between 1820 and 1840 to invest in canals, railroads, and banks.  Electoral pressure to provide these important government investments was counter-balanced by the difficulty of providing geographically specific projects and paying for them with geographically widespread taxation.  States responded with several innovative schemes for financing canals and banks in the 1820s and 1830s.  Some schemes involved taxless finance: construction of canals and banks used borrowed funds and privileges for private corporations so that current taxes did not rise, but required a contingent commitment by taxpayers to service bonds in case of the project's failure.  Other schemes involved benefit taxation: coordinating the tax costs of projects with the geographic benefits of canal and bank construction through the property tax.  When a fiscal crisis hit states in the early 1840s, they responded by changing their constitutions, and thereby economic institutions, to eliminate the possibility of taxless finance in the future""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Our standard for assessing optimality comes from a life-cycle model that incorporates uncertain lifetimes, uninsurable earnings and medical expenses, progressive taxation, government transfers, and pension and social security benefit functions derived from rich household data.  We solve every household''s decision problem from death to starting age and then use the decision rules in conjunction with earnings histories to make predictions about wealth in 1992.  Ours is the first study to compare, household by household, wealth predictions that arise from a life-cycle model that incorporates earnings histories for a nationally representative sample.  The results, based on data from the Health and Retirement Study, are striking we find that the model is capable of accounting for more than 80 percent of the 1992 cross-sectional variation in wealth.  Fewer than 20 percent of households have less wealth than their optimal targets, and the wealth deficit of those who are undersaving is generally small""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Interest rates and coupon bonds in quantum finance,B. E. Baaquie,finance,First published in 2010,/works/OL18579280W,/authors/OL3229959A/B._E._Baaquie,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 490,"""The economic crisis of 2008 has shown that the capital markets need new theoretical and mathematical concepts to describe and price financial instruments. Focusing almost exclusively on interest rates and coupon bonds, this book does not employ stochastic calculus - the bedrock of the present day mathematical finance - for any of the derivations. Instead, it analyzes interest rates and coupon bonds using quantum finance. The Heath-Jarrow-Morton and the Libor Market Model are generalized by realizing the forward and Libor interest rates as an imperfectly correlated quantum field. Theoretical models have been calibrated and tested using bond and interest rates market data.     Building on the principles formulated in the author's previous book (Quantum Finance, Cambridge University Press, 2004) this ground-breaking book brings together a diverse collection of theoretical and mathematical interest rate models. It will interest physicists and mathematicians researching in finance, and professionals working in the finance industry""--Provided by publisher.

Durch die transparente Aufbereitung der volkswirtschaftlichen Verflechtungen in den Konzepten der inländischen Input-Output-Tabelle können neben den direkten volkswirtschaftlichen Wirkungen eines Unternehmens auch dessen indirekte und induzierte Ausstrahleffekte auf die deutsche Volkswirtschaft quantifiziert werden.

Minimum wages and firm profitability,Mirko Draca,finance,First published in 2006,/works/OL23987967W,/authors/OL6500469A/Mirko_Draca,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2006|Publisher  Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics and Political Science|Language English","Although there is a large literature on the economic effects of minimum wages on labour market outcomes (especially employment), there is hardly any evidence on their impact on firm performance. This is surprising: minimum wages appear to have a significant impact on wages, but only a limited impact on jobs, so it is natural to imagine there must be a stronger impact on other aspects of firm behaviour. In this paper we consider the impact of minimum wages on firm profitability by exploiting the introduction of a minimum wage to the UK labour market in 1999. We use pre-policy information on the distribution of wages to construct treatment and comparison groups and implement a difference in differences approach. We show evidence that firm profitability was significantly reduced (and wages significantly raised) by the minimum wage introduction. This emerges from separate analyses of two distinct types of firm level panel data (one on firms in a very low wage sector, UK residentialcare homes, and a second on firms across all sectors). Interestingly, we find no evidence that the profitability reductions resulted in increases in firm exit, so our findings may be consistent with redistribution of quasi-rents towards low wage employees.

Social cost-benefit analysis in Australia and New Zealand. The state of current practice and what needs to be done,Leo Dobes,finance,First published in 2016,/works/OL20932174W,/authors/OL7209876A/Leo_Dobes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  ANU Press|Language English,"All is not well with the evaluation of government programs and projects. Resources available to any society are limited. If governments are to increase the well-being of their citizens, they must be able to select and implement the socially most beneficial projects and policies.  But many government agencies lack the expertise to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, or even to commission one. Commercial consultants, on the other hand, often have some analytical expertise, but are not immune from adopting approaches that accommodate the proclivities of their client agencies.  In order to increase analytical rigour and methodological consistency, this publication urges the adoption of a ?belts and braces? set of protocols for use in project evaluation.

Banking for a Better World,Nanno Kleiterp,finance,First published in 2017,/works/OL20931796W,/authors/OL6145475A/Nanno_Kleiterp,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Amsterdam University Press|Language Undetermined,"When we look at all the challenges facing the world, including inequality, population migration, and climate change, we can see a role for development banking in nearly all of them. But will that role be played for good or ill? This book brings together two people who collectively draw on their forty-five years of experience in that world to argue that development banking can-and must-play a constructive role.  We only need to read the news to find public outrage at tales of short-sighted greed in the financial world. But what happens when banks invest in long-term sustainability? Readers will find a fascinating example in the journey of the Dutch development bank FMO. At times global in perspective, at other moments intimately personal, Banking for a Better World interweaves candid anecdotes with development history, as well as banking lessons with client interviews, to deliver a powerful argument for a business model that generates profit through impact, and impact through profit.     This is an important and accessible must-read for anyone involved in banking, business, policy making, and civil society as a whole. Banking for a Better World challenges us to start finding overlaps between our own lives and global issues and to bridge the distance between our personal needs and those of our planet.
