Sillamy|Language French,"Nous voulons rappeler ici, l'un de nos premiers livres constitué de cinq fascicules : I, II, III, A et B intitulé : ""Essai de reconstitution de la musique de la Bible"". Cet ouvrage a été le fruit de notre première interrogation sur de petits signes placés au-dessus et au-dessous des textes bibliques : les TAAMIM, qui viennent ponctuer ces textes et constituent en même temps un système de notation musicale grâce auquel les Israélites peuvent chanter les livres de la Bible.    il y a près de 60 ans, alors que nous étions, avec quelques rares étudiants, les premiers élèves du professeur Jacques Chailley à la Sorbonne , nous nous sommes fixés pour but l'étude des musiques religieuses orales, en particulier d'origine orientale (sefarade), menacées d'assimilation par l'influence de la musique occidentale, voire de disparition. Aussi, nous avons décidé de  les recueillir et de les fixer sur des bandes magnétiques. Armé d'un magnétophone, nous nous sommes mis à visiter de nombreuses communautés en voie de diparition et de les enregistrer. Ces bandes ont été déposées à la Phonothèque Nationale de Paris où on peut encore les consulter ainsi qu'à la Phonothèque Nationale de Jérusalem et à la Radio d'Israel.

(Also originally included with the set was a life-sized, paper fold-out piano keyboard).  From the Preface:          ""Prelude to Musicianship is a basic, comprehensive textbook for a college-level course in Music Fundamentals.  It is designed for a one-quarter or one-semester course, median four hours a week. For instructors with fewer available class hours, its construction indicates basic areas of study and options for reducing nonessential materials, as well as offering opportunities for the introduction of supplementary activities for the instructor's choice.   Students taking such a course generally have little or no prior musical training and would like to satisfy a personal desire to read and understand the basic concepts of music; others lack an adequate preparation for advanced musical training.  This book addresses itself not only to these students, but also to those whose musical experience has been limited to private vocal or instrumental instruction and to the do-it-yourself person who learns outside the school curriculum.  For music majors at four-year institutions, or for private vocal and instrumental teachers, Prelude to Musicianship may prove useful as a supplementary text because of its drills and exercises.""

Consisting of a single string which could be divided at measured points by means of movable bridges, it was used to demonstrate theorems about the arithmetical relationships between pitched sounds in music. This book traces the history of the monochord and its multiple uses down to Ptolemy, bringing together all the relevant evidence in one comprehensive study. By comparing the monochord with a number of other ancient scientific instruments and their uses, David Creese shows how the investigation of music in ancient Greece not only shares in the patterns of demonstrative and argumentative instrument use common to other sciences, but also goes beyond them in offering the possibility of a rigorous empiricism unparalleled in Greek science""--Provided by publisher.

No es un método de Audioperceptiva o Entrenamiento Auditivo (ear training o aural training), ya que, como se verá, las ideas vertidas aquí no buscan orientar una acción cronológicamente organizada ni pretenden imponer una didáctica basada en una secuencia de contenidos y actividades determinadas. Por el contrario, se presentan las bases teóricas y metodológicas para un abordaje flexible y situado de los problemas que atañen al desarrollo de las habilidades de audición. Además, tanto el marco teórico de la Audioperceptiva, que prescribe cómo se escucha la música, como el paradigma psicológico que fundamenta las prácticas del Entrenamiento Auditivo serán aquí objeto de una profunda crítica. Comprender la particularidad de esta propuesta, entonces, requiere conocer el alcance del trabajo de la cátedra mencionada y sus necesidades específicas derivadas de las características de sus destinatarios inmediatos, los estudiantes del Ciclo de Formación Básica en música de la Facultad de Bellas Artes (UNLP), y orientadas a los perfiles de las carreras allí ofrecidas.

Jahrhundert wird gemeinhin als Inkubationszeit betrachtet, als eine Ära wichtiger Umbrüche und Innovationen, die vor 1500 eintraten, ihre Wirkung allerdings erst im folgenden Jahrhundert zur vollen Entfaltung brachten. Dabei ist dieses Jahrhundert nicht primär 'gerade noch' ('Herbst des Mittelalters') oder 'noch nicht' (Vor-Reformation), sondern eine auf vielen Feldern vitale Zeit von selbstständigem Rang, die es perspektivenreich zu sichten und zuerötern gilt. Der vorliegende Band illustriert aus einem fachübergreifenden Blickwinkel das reiche und vielfältige geistig-kulturelle Leben des Jahrhunderts für sich, losgelöst von möglichenfalls später aus ihm hervorgegangenen Phänomenen der Religions-, Meidien=, Globalisierungs- und Wissen(schafts)geschichte. Dieses Leben bietet Ansatzpunkte und Forschungsgebiete für viele Disziplinen, die in diesem Tagungsband versammelt sind. --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Situated in the still evolving field of artistic research, this book investigates a fundamental quality of this process. Building on the lessons of deconstruction, artistic research invents new modes of epistemic relationships that include aesthetic dimensions.  Under the heading transposition, seventeen artists, musicians, and theorists explain how one thing may turn into another in a spatio-temporal play of identity and difference that has the power to expand into the unknown. By connecting materially concrete positions in a way familiar to artists, this book shows how moves can be made between established positions and completely new ground. In doing so, research changes from a process that expands knowledge to one that creatively reinvents it.

Så kunde man uttrycka sig i svensk kulturdebatt för femtio år sedan. Därmed anslås ett ledmotiv i denna essä: växelspelet mellan modernitet och modernism och dess konsekvenser för musikens vidkommande. Vi får följa denna utveckling från mitten av 1800-talet till slutet av 1960-talet med personer som Wagner, Baudelaire och Nietzsche, Schönberg, Stravinskij och Adorno, de italienska futuristerna och fransmännen kring den konkreta musiken i blickpunkten. Vi möter reflexioner kring avantgardism och dess svenska varianter i symbios med folkhemmet och det hela utmynnar i ett sammanflöde av modernism och modernitet med Luciano Berios berömda Sinfonia i centrum.

He is also the guardian of two striking nieces who share his Fifth Avenue mansion. Mary, her uncle's favorite, is to inherit his fortune at his death. As this mystery opens, that lamentable event has just occurred. Leavenworth has been shot to death and circumstances point to one of his young wards.  Circumstantial evidence points in one direction; but is that the trail to follow? Not to give anything away, but Yale University used this book in its law school to demonstrate the fallability of such evidence.      First published in 1878, nine years before the debut of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, this atmospheric and suspenseful mystery well deserves a modern audience. When someone shoots Horatio Leavenworth, a wealthy retired merchant, through the head in his library late one night, the evidence at the inquest indicates that no one could have left the victim's locked Manhattan mansion before the discovery of the body the next morning. Suspicion thus falls on members of the household, specifically the dead man's nieces, Mary and Eleanore, only one of whom stands to benefit from their uncle's death. Everett Raymond, a junior partner in a New York law firm that had Leavenworth as a client, teams with unassuming official investigator Ebenezer Gryce to seek the truth. Green (1846-1935), whose smooth prose remains fresh, makes Gryce an interesting enough character to leave fans of traditional whodunits eager to see more of the detective in reissues of his further exploits.

Pathologist John Berry strips away the secrecy and hypocrisy that surround abortion when his best friend, Dr. Arthur Lee, is accused of performing the ""scrape"" that led to the death of Karen Randall, teen-age daughter of a prominent Boston surgeon.  Art Lee, iconoclastic, troubled gynecologist, performs abortions because he feels a moral obligation to do so, and the entire medical community is aware of this. Dr. John Berry is certain that Lee is not responsible for Karen's death, and he is determined to prove it.  His search for the truth leads him through hospital labs, mansions, college dorms, addicts' pads. He rattles skeletons and high-class closets as he uncovers tawdry sexual secrets among the medical elite. He incurs the enmity of Boston society, the wrath of the police, and the revenge of the underworld-all of whom are interested in obscuring the facts that surround Karen Randall's tragic death.  This tautly strung novel leads inevitably to a climax of violence and to a sobering revelation that goes to the heart of a sick society. Here, in language peppered with the irreverent abbreviations doctors use to reduce their life-and-death responsibilities to manageable dimensions, the author deals with the American attitude toward abortion and its effect on all of society. The story covers six suspenseful days that expose far more than the short, unhappy life of Karen Randall.   Read more Read less",96 Want to read|5 Currently reading|10 Have read

Dutton & Company|Language English|Pages 277,"This is probably one of the top classics of ""golden age"" detective fiction. Anyone who's read any mystery novels at all will be familiar with the tropes -- an English country house in the first half of the twentieth century, a locked room, a dead body, an amateur sleuth, a helpful sidekick, and all the rest.  It's a clever story, ingenious enough in its way, and an iconic example of Agatha Christie / Dorothy Sayers -type murder mysteries. If you've read more than a few of those kinds of books, you might find this one a little predictable, but it's fun despite that.  It's particularly of note, however, because Raymond Chandler wrote about it extensively in his essay ""The Simple Art of Murder."" After praising it as ""an agreeable book, light, amusing in the Punch style, written with a deceptive smoothness that is not as easy as it looks,"" he proceeds to take it sharply to task for its essential lack of realism. This book -- which Chandler admired to an extent -- was what he saw as the iconic example of what was wrong with the detective fiction of his day, and to which novels like ""The Big Sleep"" or ""The Long Goodbye"", with their hard-boiled, hard-hitting gumshoes and gritty realism, were a direct response.  So this book's worth reading not just because it's ""an agreeable book, light, [and] amusing in the Punch style"", but also because reading it will give a deepened appreciation for the later, more realistic detective fiction of writers like Hammett and Chandler.

When Ernest Fletcher is found bludgeoned to death in his study, everyone is shocked and mystified: Ernest was well liked and respected, so who would have a motive for killing him? Inspectors of Scotland Yard felt it was an unlikely crime for the London suburbs: a perfectly respectable chap at home with his head bashed in. It seems the real Fletcher was far from the gentleman he pretended to be. There is, in fact, no shortage of people who wanted him dead.  Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant Hemingway, with consummate skill, uncover one dirty little secret after another, and with them, a host of people who all have reasons for wanting Fletcher dead. Who tiptoed into the study to do the deed? The rather nefarious nephew Neville? A neighbor's wandering wife? A fat man in a bowler hat?  The mystery's key was a blunt instrument--a weapon that the police could not find... and that the murderer can to use once more. Then, a second murder is committed, with striking similarities to the first, giving a grotesque twist to a very unusual case, and the inspectors realize they are up against a killer on a mission....

For the next eight years Dr Beck re-lived the horror of what happened that day every day of his life. Then one afternoon, he receives an anonymous e-mail telling him to log on to a certain web-site at a certain time, using a code that only he and his wife knew. The screen opens on to a web cam - and it is Elizabeth's image he sees. Is it a practical joke? But as Beck tries to find out if Elizabeth is truly alive, and what really happened the night she disappeared, the FBI are trying to pin Elizabeth's murder on him. And everyone he turns to seems to end up dead?  From the author's website:    TELL NO ONE is a story of loss and redemption. It begins innocently enough. Dr. David Beck and his beloved wife, Elizabeth, are celebrating the anniversary of their first kiss in the quiet of Lake Charmaine. They grew up together, first kissed at age twelve, and now, twenty-five years old and married less than a year, they return for an idyllic weekend away.  Tragedy shatters their solitude. Elizabeth is abducted and murdered, her body found in a ditch. Her killer is caught and brought to justice. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. Eight years pass. He never gets over Elizabeth’s murder. He loses himself in his work as an inner city pediatrician.  But everything changes on the eighth anniversary of Elizabeth’s death. Two unidentified bodies are found at Lake Charmaine, unearthed years after their deaths. But even more disturbing, Beck gets a bizarre email that mentions a specific phrase – a phrase known only to him and Elizabeth. The email also tells him to click a hyperlink the next day at a specific hour – “kiss time” – 6:15PM.   Read more Read less",55 Want to read|4 Currently reading|13 Have read

Interests clash and a whiff of a scandalous blackmail letter hangs in the air. Unfortunately, it seems that on this occasion, the marksmen's quarry is destined to be human.  Tragedy befalls the Carter family when Wally was killed. No one cared that Wally Carter was dead. Pity. But someone had cared enough to shoot him through the chest. Who the devil could it be?  The superlatively analytical Inspector Hemingway is confronted by a murder that seems impossible -- no one was near the murder weapon at the time the shot was fired. But everyone on the scene seems to have a motive, not to mention the wherewithal to commit murder, and alibis that simply don't hold up. The inspector is sorely tried by a wide variety of suspects, including the neglected rich widow, Ermyntrude, the neighbor who's in love with her, her resentful daughter, and a patently phony Russian prince preying on the widow's emotional vulnerability and social aspirations. And then there's the blackmail plot that may -- or may not -- be at the heart of the case...

A town house owned by an Internet millionaire is immediately engulfed in flames, and when Lindsay plunges inside to search for survivors, she finds three people dead. An infant who lived in the house cannot be found - and a mysterious message at the scene leaves Lindsay and the San Francisco Police Department completely baffled. Then a prominent businessman is found murdered under bizarre circumstances, with another mysterious message left behind by the killer. Lindsay asks her friends Claire Washburn of the medical examiner's office, Assistant D.A. Jill Bernhardt, and Chronicle reporter Cindy Thomas to help her figure out who is committing these murders-and why they are intent on killing someone every three days. Even more terrifying, the killer has targeted one of the four friends who call themselves the Women's Murder Club. Which one will it be? While the investigation rages furiously, Lindsay works very closely with a federal officer assigned to the case.

Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier's son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army's brightest stars. But in every cop's life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.New Year's Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down.  The world is changing.  And in a North Carolina ""hot-sheets"" motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can't be controlled. Within hours the general's wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.Two Special Forces soldiers--the toughest of the tough--are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher--an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit--is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.But Reacher won't quit. He's fighting a new kind of war. And he's taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn't know he had. With his French-born mother dying--and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret--Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed...about his family, his career, his loyalties--and himself. Because this soldier's son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death--and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.From the Hardcover edition.

Only her compulsive chatter hinted at the nervousness beneath her cool surface. It was a nervousness out of all proportion to the problem she placed before Kinsey Millhone.  Still business was slow, and even a private investigator has bills to pay. Millhone took the job. It looked routine.  Elaine Boldt's wrappings were a good deal flashier than her sister's, but they signaled the same thing: The lady had money. According to the manager of her California building, the wealthy widow was last seen draped in her $12,000 lynx coat heading for Boca Raton. According to the manager of her Florida building, she never got there. But someone else had, and she was camping out illegally in Mrs. Boldt's apartment. The job was beginning to seem a bit less routine.  It turned tricky when Beverly Danziger ordered Millhone to drop the case, and it took on an ominous quality when Aubrey Danziger surfaced, making all kinds of wild accusations about his wife. But it only became sinister when Millhone learned that just days before Elaine Boldt went missing, her next-door neighbor and bridge partner had been murdered, and the killer was still at large.  As Millhone digs deeper into the case, she finds herself in a nightmarish hall of mirrors in which reality is distorted by illusion and nothing--except danger--is quite what it seems.

Ma poco prima di andare in stampa, un triplice omicidio fa sospendere la pubblicazione, mentre si scatena una vera e propria caccia all'uomo: l'attenzione di polizia e media nazionali si concentra su Lisbeth Salander, la giovane hacker, ""così impeccabilmente competente e al tempo stesso così socialmente irrecuperabile"", ora principale sospettata. Blomkvist, incurante di quanto tutti sembrano credere, dà il via a un'indagine per accertare le responsabilità di Lisbeth, ""la donna che odia gli uomini che odiano le donne"". È lei la vera protagonista di questo nuovo episodio della Millennium Trilogy, un thriller serrato che all'intrigo diabolico unisce un'acuta descrizione della società moderna, con le sue contraddizioni e deviazioni, consegnandoci con Lisbeth Salander un personaggio femminile unico, commovente e indimenticabile.

They're sixty-five years old, or will be when their dates come around. They're family men, stable; civil servants mostly; men of minor authority.  ""Their deaths are the final step in an operation to which I and the leaders of the Organization have devoted many years, enormous effort, and a large part of the Organization's fortune.

P. Putnam's Sons|Language English,"A Eve Dallas Investigation In Death  New York Lieutenant Eve Dallas doesn't like to see innocent people murdered. And the death of Craig Foster is clearly a murder. He was seemingly ordinary history teacher, but uncovers some extraordinary surprises. Foster's death devastated his young wife, who'd sent him to work that day with a lovingly packed lunch. It shocked his colleagues at the private school, too, and as for the ten-year-old girls who found him in his classroom in a pool of bodily fluids-they may have been traumatized for life.  Eve soon determines that Foster's homemade lunch was tainted with deadly ricin, and that Mr. Foster's colleagues have some startling secrets of their own. It's Eve's job to sort it out- and discover why someone would have done this to a man who seemed so inoffensive, so pleasant... so innocent.  Now Magdalena Percell... there's someone Eve can picture as a murder victim. Possibly at Eve's own hands. The slinky blonde-an old flame of her billionaire husband, Roarke-has arrived in New York, and she's anything but innocent. Roarke seems blind to Magdalena's manipulation, and he insists that the occasional lunch or business meeting with her is nothing to worry about... and none of Eve's business. Consumed by her jealousy--and Roarke's indifference to it, she is unnerved by the situation that she finds it hard to focus on her case. Still, she'll have to put aside her feelings, for a while at least-because another man has just turned up dead.  Eve knows all too well that innocence can be a facade. Keeping that in mind may help her solve this case at last. But it may also tear apart her marriage.   Read more Read less",23 Want to read|2 Currently reading|13 Have read

Lieutenant Eve Dallas has a grisly double homicide to solve when two young lovers-both employees of the same prestigious accounting firm-are brutally killed on the same night. It doesn't leave Eve a lot of leftover time to put together a baby shower for her buddy Mavis Freestone, but that's supposedly what friends are for.  Now Mavis needs another favor. Tandy Willowby, one of the moms-to-be in Mavis's birthing class, didn't show up for the shower. A recent emigrant from London, Tandy has few friends in New York, and no family-and she was really looking forward to the party. And when Eve enters Tandy's apartment and finds a gift for Mavis's shower wrapped and ready on the table-and a packed bag for the hospital still on the floor next to it-tingling runs up and down her spine.  Normally, such a case would be turned over to Missing Persons. But Mavis wants no one else on the job but Eve-and Eve can't say no. She'll have to track Tandy down while simultaneously unearthing the deals and double-crosses hidden in the files of some of the city's richest and most secretive citizens, in a race against this particularly vicious killer. Luckily, her multimillionaire husband Roarke's expertise comes in handy with the number crunching. But as he mines the crucial data that will break the case wide open, Eve faces an all too real danger in the world of flesh and blood.

So begins this scintillating collection of long and short stories by Ruth Rendell. It was clear to both Wexford and Burden that Tom Peterlee was not killed for £360, but various people would have liked them to think he was… It is a case which reminds the Chief Inspector that there is only a thin line dividing the cop from the criminal. The criminal impulse may be present in the most routine or intimate situation. In this second story, Browning’s poem, ‘Porphyria’s Lover’, is the inspiration for the murderous passion. In Shreds and Shivers the accidental discovery of Amanita phalloides (a poisonous mushroom) leads to a game of Russian Roulette in a supermarket. With unerring insight and deceptive economy of style, Ruth Rendell probes behind the passions of everyday life to pinpoint the frailties, the desires and deceptions, the guilty secret of human beings.The book ends with The Strawberry Tree, a disturbingly evocative novella-length tale of lost innocence set on the island of Majorca. It is a triumphant conclusion to a collection of stories that will linger in the mind.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Then the Feds announce a full-out investigation into local police corruption, and everything goes haywire.  Klein's been hung out as bait, """"a bad cop to draw the heat,"""" and the heat's coming from all sides: from local politicians, from LAPD brass, from racketeers and drug kingpins-all of them hell-bent on keeping their own secrets hidden. For Klein, """"forty-two and going on dead,"""" it's dues time.  Klein tells his own story-his voice clipped, sharp, often as brutal as the events he's describing-taking us with him on a journey through a world shaped by monstrous ambition, avarice, and perversion.

Mason was a highly skilled and unscrupulous lawyer who used the law to defeat the ends of justice. Of the stories in the collection, ""The Corpus Delecti"" is probably the most powerful as well as the most gruesome — and by far the most famous. When this story first appeared it had such a profound effect on the public that it resulted in widespread reforms of the old law of corpus delecti — it is no longer necessary to have to produce an actual corpse to prove that murder has been done. With this, his first book, Post firmly established his position as one of the great detective short story writers of all time. Generally, in these stories he showed the villain how to circumvent the law — but, at the same time, as he said, he also warned the friends of law and order.

Now the hard-edged and coolheaded detective fights for truth and justice, but she still has one very human weakness-enigmatic Irish billionaire, Roarke. And when a trusted employee of Roarke Enterprises is a suspect in a double-homicide, Roarke comes to Eve for help.  Killing was too good for him. She wanted him to beg and plead like the gutter rat he was she wanted him to bleed and screamonly then the bastard could die. A slow, withering, agonizing death. Nobody, cheated on Reva Ewing. Reva was a former member of the Secret Service, and now a security specialist for Roarke Enterprises-until she was found standing over the dead bodies of her husband, renowned artist Blair Bissel, and her best friend. She is the prime suspect in a double homicide - accused of killing her adulterous husband and his lover - the woman Reva thought was her best friend.  But despite having every reason for wanting both of them dead, Reva protests her innocence and Lieutenant Eve Dallas believes her. Eve believes there was more to the killing than jealous rage, at the time of the murders all of Bissel's computer files were deliberately corrupted. At the time of the murders, Reva's husband's computer system was also sabotaged. To Roarke, it's the computer attack that poses the real threat. Roarke Industries have been working on a top secret government contract to develop a program that would shield against a new breed of hackers. The Doomsday Group are techno-terrorists who attack systems, steal data, and corrupt computer units on a large scale - and they kill anyone who gets too close.

But the murder, bloody and brutal, of an entire family in their own home, in there own beds, was a different form of evil.  No affairs. No criminal connections. No DNA. No clues. Eve Dallas may be the best cop in the city--not to mention having the lavish resources of her husband, Roarke, at her disposal--but the Swisher case has her baffled. On the surface Keelie and Grant Swisher seem unlikely targets for an assassin; an average couple living in a nice neighbourhood and working hard to raise their two kids. But when Eve Dallas is called to a multiple homicide at the Swisher family home, she discovers a blood-bath. There are five dead - including two children - in what seems to be a professional hit. The killers breached an elaborate state-of-the-art security system, and the killers used night-vision equipment to find their way through the cozy, middle-class house. With brutal, military precision, they slashed the throat of each victim while they slept in their beds; and were in and out of the house in less than ten minutes. Clearly, Eve is dealing with pros. In fact they made only one mistake... they left a survivor. They overlooked the nine-year-old girl cowering in the darkened kitchen. Nixie Swisher's sudden urge for a midnight snack may just have saved her life. While her parents, brother and best-friend lay in their beds, oblivious to the threat, Nixie was downstairs in the kitchen getting a soda... and she saw far too much.  Kids are not Dallas's strong suit. But Now Nixie Swisher is an orphan-and the sole eyewitness to a seemingly inexplicable crime, and Dallas needs to solve this case. Eve knows that her priority is to keep her safe. Offering her a temporary refuge is easy, but dealing with the emotional needs of a nine-year-old girl who has lost everything isn't. Not only for the cause of justice. With her partner, Peabody, back on the job-and her husband, Roarke, providing the kind of help that only he can give-Lieutenant Eve Dallas is running after shadows, and dead-set on finding out who's behind them. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories--and deepest fears. But she's chasing professionals who don't like leaving loose ends. And leaving Nixie Swisher alive is one loose end too many....   Read more Read less",13 Want to read|1 Currently reading|9 Have read

Fall, with its cooler temperatures was coming. Maybe people wouldn't be as inclined to kill each other. But she doubted it.'  In 2059 New York City, technology and humanity collide, Detective Eve Dallas searches the darkest corners of Manhattan for an elusive killer with a passion for collecting souls...  On one of the city's hottest nights, New York Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas is sent to Central Park-and into a hellish new investigation. Her latest homicide case is a particularly vicious case. The victim, Elisa Maplewood, a young mother, is found on the rocks, just above the still, dark water of the lake. Raped and strangled in the park, her body naked but for what appears to be a single red ribbon tied around her neck. Her hands are posed, as if in prayer. But it is the eyes-removed with such precision, as if done with the careful hands of a surgeon-that have Dallas most alarmed.  Eve starts investigating Elisa's friends and relations, and as more bodies turn up, each with the same defining scars, Eve is frantic for answers. An offer of help comes from an unlikely source. The only reason Eve agrees to meet with psychic Celina Sanchez is that she is a friend of a friend. But Celina claims to have experienced visions of the killer and can recite precise details of the case - details that the police have kept to themselves. She is also no glory-hunter - she doesn't want her name released to the media. Haunted by the visions of death that she sees, all she wants to do is help Eve catch the criminal so that she is left in peace. Though Eve remains sceptical of Celina's abilities, against her instincts, she serves the greater good, and she will use all the resources she can to track down the killer before he strikes again...  The psychic who offers one vision after another-each with shockingly accurate details of the murders. And when partner and friend Peabody is badly injured after escaping an attack, the stakes are raised. Are the eyes a symbol? A twisted religious ritual? A souvenir? With help from her husband, Roarke, Dallas must uncover the killer's motivation before another vision becomes another nightmare....

Eve Dallas is one tough cop. She's got no problem dealing with a holiday reveler in a red suit who plunges thirty-seven stories and gives new meaning to the term ""sidewalk Santa."" But when she gets back to the station and Trudy Lombard shows up, it's all Eve can do to hold it together. Instantly, she's thrown back into the past, to the days when she was a vulnerable, traumatized girl-trapped in foster care with the twisted woman who now sits in front of her, smiling.  Trudy claims she just wanted to see how Eve was doing. But Eve's fiercely protective husband, Roarke, suspects otherwise-and his suspicions prove correct when Trudy arrives at his office, demanding money in exchange for keeping the ugly details of his wife's childhood a secret. Barely restraining himself, Roarke shows her the door-and makes it clear that she'd be wise to get out of New York and never bother him or his wife again.  Eve and Roarke just want the woman out of their lives, but someone else wants her dead. Just a few days later, Trudy's found on the floor of her hotel room, a mess of bruises and blood. A cop to the core, Eve is determined to solve the case, if only for the sake of Trudy's bereaved son. Unfortunately, Eve is not the only one to have suffered at this woman's hands, and she and Roarke will follow a circuitous, dangerous path to find out who turned this victimizer into a victim.

Two cousins, Derek and Nigel Burtell, have agreed to a canoeing voyage up the Thames, the object being to restore Derek's failing health. As it happens, Derek is shortly to inherit £50,000 from his grand father. In view of the young man's deteriorating physical condition, however, the Indescribable Insurance Company (Knox's nod to the ""Lord, what fun!"" school of detective fiction) has insured his life, in the event he does not reach his 25th birthday, the scheduled date of his windfall.  The journey upstream goes without a hitch: however, the return trip is destined to be less than idyllic. Nigel leaves the canoe at Shipcote Lock to take an exam at Oxford. Before he can rejoin his brother, the canoe is discovered adrift below the lock, empty and with a jagged gash in the bottom. Derek is nowhere to be found.  Suspecting foul play, the Indescribable sends Miles Bredon, the firm's premier investigator, to look into the case. Can the pastoral reaches of the upper Thames be harboring a murderer? Has Derek met with an accident? Will the company have to pay up? To complicate matters, Nigel Burtell has also vanished.  Thus begins an urbane and literate mystery, delightfully tongue-in-cheek in tone, that offers mystery buffs ample opportunity to match wits with the imperturbable Bredon and to puzzle over a cluster of clues--a set of strange photographs, a baffling cipher, a trail of naked footprints in the mud near the lock. The author's poetic evocation of the river and the countryside through which it flows provides a peaceful counterpoint to the dubious deeds under investigation.

McBain piles on the action and absurdity at a furious pace as Barnes sinks deeper and deeper into the worst New York has to offer. McBain has always been adept at infusing his hard-boiled fiction with a sardonic humor that borders on the ludicrous. In ""Downtown,"" he proves he can still walk that tightrope as he balances the hilarity of Barnes' situation with a lean, hard-hitting narrative style.  In fact, McBain's humor is so deliberately distracting, you don't realize it when he turns deadly serious. Michael Barnes may be bounced from one jam to another, but he too has a dark side, like most McBain characters. When pushed enough, he too becomes as deadly as his foes and as hard-boiled as any Raymond Chandler creation. ""Downtown"" is another example of Ed McBain at his best. Highly recommended.

When the tabloids got hold of the story, they immediately called the killer 'The Rottweiler', and the name stuck. The latest body was discovered very near Inez Ferry's antique shop in Marylebone. Someone spotted a shadowy figure running away past the station, but couldn't say for sure if it was a man or a woman. There were only two other clues. The murderer seemed to have a preference for strangling his victims and then removing something personal - like a cigarette lighter or a necklace... Since her actor husband died, too early into their marriage, Inez supplemented her modest income by taking in tenants above the shop. The unpredictably obsessive activities of 'The Rottweiler' would exert a profound influence on this heterogeneous little community, especially when the suspicion began to emerge that one of them might be a homicidal maniac.

In the suffocating stillness of an airless trailer, a woman is lying dead, a bullet hole in her chest. Why someone would murder a harmless loner with a soft spot for stray dogs is only one of the questions  nagging at the local police; another is why the killer used an eighty-five-year-old bullet, fired from the same weapon that slaughtered two other women who were discovered bound, naked, and gruesomely posed on the remote edge of a rancher's land.The slayings are as oppressive as the blistering heat for Sheriff Joanna Brady, who must shoulder the added double burden of a brutal reelection campaign and major developments on the home front. With suddenly more on her plate than many big-city law officers have to contend with, Joanna must put marital distractions and an opponent's dirty tricks in the background and deal with the terrifying reality that now threatens everyone in her jurisdiction: a serial killer in their midst.A twisted and lethal drama is unfolding in this small corner of the southwestern desert as fear, hatred, and the evil at the core of one family's history come to a rapid boil beneath a merciless Arizona sun. Pressure mounts for Sheriff Brady personally and professionally while she pursues a sadistic murderer into the shadows of the past to get to the roots of a monstrous obsession ... and expose the permanent wounds of a crime far worse than homicide.The incomparable J.

It was, of course, the small village of St. Mary Mead that served as Miss Marple's training ground in the finer points of criminal behavior, and this, according to the former commissioner of Scotland Yard, Sir Henry Clithering, was clearly a matter of ""natural genius cultivated in a suitable soil."" While others are mulling over seemingly unfathomable situations, Miss Marple uses her principles to sort out facts and ""go straight to the truth like a homing pigeon.""

When former tennis star Suzze T and her rock star husband, Lex, encounter an anonymous Facebook post questioning the paternity of their unborn child, Lex runs off, and Suzze – at eight months pregnant – asks Myron to save her marriage, and perhaps her husband’s life. But when he finds Lex, he also finds someone he wasn’t looking for: his sister-in-law, Kitty, who along with Myron’s brother abandoned the Bolitar family long ago.  As Myron races to locate his missing brother while their father clings to life, he must face the lies that led to the estrangement – including the ones told by Myron himself.

This story is a great intertwining of two very strong and emotional storylines. The author does a fantastic job of moving between the two without disrupting the flow of the other. The stories are tied together by the main character Detective Steve Carella. One story is very personal, dealing with the brutal murder of his father and the highly visible trial of the accused murderer. During this same time, Carella is working on a police investigation of the attempted murder of a wealthy and beautiful woman. This story is filled with murder, hired killers, marital betrayel, and the dark side of the legal system. Keeps the attention of the listener. Only negative I felt was that the language could have been tempered without losing the momentum. All in all, a very enjoyable experience.

Three hundred years ago, when Cromwell's raiders swept through a village in this valley, not a living creature was to be found on its fog-shrouded streets. The entire population had taken refuge in Keldale Abbey. But then, as the legend goes, an infant began to cry-and the villages knew they had escaped Cromwell's ravages only to be betrayed by a babe. So they smothered the child to silence it.  To this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale's lush green valleys.  Now, into this pastoral web of old houses and older secrets comes New Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley. Accompanied by Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, Lynley has been sent to solve a particularly savage murder which has stunned the peaceful countryside.  Fat, unlovely Roberta Teys has been found, clad in her best silk dress, seated in the great stone barn beside her father's decapitated corpse. Her first and only words were: ""I did it. I'm not sorry."" She has refused to speak since. The priest who found young Roberta insists the girl is innocent. The villagers, who have known the girl all of her life, concur. The local police, however, maintain that she's guilty of the brutal slaying of one of the region's most respected citizens.  As Lynley and Havers wind their way through Keldale's dark labyrinth of scandals, they uncover a series of revelations that will reverberate through this tranquil English valley-and in their own lives as well.  In A Great Deliverance Elizabeth George probes the delicate motivations of the heart against a backdrop of buried scandals, unresolved antagonisms and dizzying ambiguities. It was her debut novel, the winner of the Agatha and Anthony Awards for best first novel as well as France's Grand Prix de Litterature Policiere. It was nominated for both a Macavity and an Edgar. It has been optioned for television by the BBC.   Read more Read less",25 Want to read|1 Currently reading|9 Have read

At least, that's what everyone in Angel's Gap thinks. They have no idea that she used to be Elaine O'Hara, daughter of the notorious con man Big Jack O'Hara. Or that she grew up moving from place to place, one step ahead of the law . . .  Laine's past has just caught up with her, though-in a very dramatic way. Her long-lost uncle suddenly turned up in her shop, leaving only a cryptic warning before dying in the street, run down by a car. Soon afterward, her home is ransacked. Now it's up to Laine, and a sexy stranger named Max Gannon, to find out who's chasing her, and why.  The answer lies in a hidden fortune-a fortune that will change not only Laine's life but also the lives of future generations. And danger and death will surround that fortune for years to come. Until New York City detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas gets on the case.  A thrill-ride of a novel that blends present-day romance and futuristic suspense, Remember When is a tale of deceit and secrets, of strong women and fascinating men-a brilliant combination of the incomparable talents of the two sides of Nora Roberts.

La vida del inspector Kurt Wallander ha cambiado ligeramente: no sólo ha hecho realidad su sueño de tener una casa en el campo, sino que, además, su hija Linda lo ha convertido en abuelo. Sin embargo, su tranquilidad se ve perturbada poco después, un día de invierno de 2008, cuando el suegro de Linda, un oficial de alto rango de la Marina sueca llamado Håkan von Enke, desaparece en un bosque cerca de Estocolmo. Aunque la investigación la dirige la policía de Estocolmo, Wallander no puede evitar implicarse, sobre todo cuando una segunda persona desaparece en misteriosas circunstancias. Algunas pistas apuntan a grupos de extrema derecha en el seno de la Marina sueca y a la época de la Guerra Fría, en particular a la década de los ochenta, cuando varios submarinos soviéticos fueron acusados de violar territorio sueco.

Taschenbuch-Verl.|Language German|Pages 379,"La vida del célebre poeta sueco Jesper Humlin puede ser tan regalada como vacua, tocada por el desasosiego de la sociedad de la abundancia, sumida en una inanidad apenas salpimentada por las trifulcas con su pareja, las envidias de sus colegas o los apremios de sus editores. Sin embargo, parecería que Jesper conserva un resto de dignidad cuando rechaza la propuesta de su editor de que escriba novelas policíacas, que venden cincuenta veces más que la poesía (¡si hasta su anciana madre se ha puesto a escribir una!). Y quizá sea ese vestigio de decencia lo que desencadene su interés por las historias de unas inmigrantes que conoce durante una lectura poética de su obra. Entre ellas está una joven africana, Tea-Bag, el relato de cuya huida de su aldea, el atroz viaje hacia el norte –con obligada «escala» en las costas españolas– y su llegada a Suecia, donde sigue siendo ilegal, acabará por descolocar, y redimir, al fatuo Jesper. Porque son las conmovedoras historias de las inmigrantes –personas de carne y hueso– las que dan cuerpo a esta novela que abre los ojos a una cruda realidad con la que convivimos pero que pocas veces nos atrevemos a mirar de frente. Y Henning Mankell, en un ejercicio comprometido no exento de humor e ironía –«No me gustan las novelas policiacas. Me aburren», afirma Jesper Humlin–, no sólo da voz a esas personas tantas veces silenciadas sino que esboza una turbadora intuición: la de que sólo a través de ellas podemos ya desembarazarnos del peso de nuestro cinismo.

The stunningly wide-ranging coverage included appearances on The Rosie ODonnell Show, MTVs Real World, and The Early Show, print features in everything from USA Today to The Advocate, and a website deluged with e-mails from fans. One of the most original writers of a new generation was launched. His new novel, The Snow Garden, is a story of murder and sexual menace on a snowbound university campus. When a respected professors wife drives to her death in an icy river, an illicit relationship between a student and his teacher threatens to come to light, and within days Atherton University is the scene of escalating speculation and intrigue. Another death emerges from the shadows, and the connections between the two accidents begin to look uncomfortably close.  As in A Density of Souls, Christopher Rice explores the dynamic within a tightly knit group of young people haunted by sexual memories and fears and driven by obscure desires. The Snow Garden casts this web of friendship and passion against the backdrop of a threat that grows darker as the novel proceeds. The result is a stunning new novel from an arresting talent.

She is apparently the daughter of the aristocratic Mountfort family of Charleston, South Carolina, kidnapped as an infant from their ancestral home - and has an identical twin sister.  Travelling to Charleston, Molly meets her delicately lovely long-lost twin; her mother's stern cousin, now the family patriarch, doubtful of Molly's identity and suspicious of her motives; and his tiny, enigmatic wife, a psychic who channels the spirit of a man who died mysteriously on the Mountfort estate a generation before.  As Molly searches for the truth of her own origins, she comes to realize that the secrets of her troubled family's past have a strange and powerful hold on the present. Her reappearance in the lives of the Mountfort clan sets in motion events that threaten the family's very existence - as well as her own.

Like his creation Sherlock Holmes, Doyle had ""a horror of destroying documents,"" and until his death in 1930, they accumulated to vast amount throughout his house at Windlesham. They provide many of the words incorporated by Carr in this lively portrayal of Doyle's forays into politics, his infatuation with spiritualism, his literary ambitions, and dinner-table conversations with friends like H. G. Wells and King Edward VII. Carr, then, in a sense collaborates with his subject to unfold a colorful narrative that takes Doyle from his school days at Stonyhurst to Edinburgh University and a medical practice at Southsea, where he conceived the idea of wedding scientific study to criminal investigation in the fictive person of Sherlock Holmes. It also explores the private tragedy of Doyle's first marriage and long-delayed second as it follows him into the arena of public activity, propaganda, and literary output that would win him not only celebrity but also knighthood. 8 pages of black-and-white photographs are featured.

How Frank and Joe find the missing deed and the other Ramapan treasures, how they prevent the phony leather-goods salesman from carrying out a ruthless scheme, and how they help their father solve the top-secret case he is working on for the U.S. government makes exciting reading for all fans of the Hardy boys. - Flyleaf.

Daniel Graham MacCormick--Mac for short--seems to have a pretty good life. At age thirty-five he's living in Key West, owner of a forty-two-foot charter fishing boat, The Maine. Mac served five years in the Army as an infantry officer with two tours in Afghanistan. He returned with the Silver Star, two Purple Hearts, scars that don't tan, and a boat with a big bank loan. Truth be told, Mac's finances are more than a little shaky. One day, Mac is sitting in the famous Green Parrot Bar in Key West, contemplating his life, and waiting for Carlos, a hotshot Miami lawyer heavily involved with anti-Castro groups. Carlos wants to hire Mac and The Maine for a ten-day fishing tournament to Cuba at the standard rate, but Mac suspects there is more to this and turns it down. The price then goes up to two million dollars, and Mac agrees to hear the deal, and meet Carlos's clients--a beautiful Cuban-American woman named Sara Ortega, and a mysterious older Cuban exile, Eduardo Valazquez. What Mac learns is that there is sixty million American dollars hidden in Cuba by Sara's grandfather when he fled Castro's revolution. With the ""Cuban Thaw"" underway between Havana and Washington, Carlos, Eduardo, and Sara know it's only a matter of time before someone finds the stash--by accident or on purpose.

Cilia McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother -- a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago.  Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilia's almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilia steels herself against Ford's quirky charm, though she can't help indulging in a little fantasy.  But it's reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilia. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother's life -- and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilia and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother. be cut down in the prime of her life.

Responding to a gunshot, the LAPD has found an injured man in an alleyway.  He has told the officer on the scene that he is looking for his son, Elvis Cole.  Minutes later, the man is dead.Haunted throughout his life by a lack of knowledge about his father, Elvis turns to the one person who can help him navigate the minefield of his past-- his longtime partner and confidant, Joe Pike.  Together with hard-edged LAPD detective, Carol Starkey, they launch a feverish search for the dead man's identity--even as Elvis struggles between wanting to believe he's found his father at last and allowing his suspicions to hold him back.  With each long-buried clue they unearth, a frightening picture begins to emerge about who the dead man might have been and the terrible secret he's been guarding.At the same time, Elvis has no way of knowing he has awakened a sleeping monster.  The further he goes in his investigation, the closer he draws to a merciless killer who is violently connected to the unidentified man's past.  This psychopath believes Cole is hunting him, and he goes on the attack to find Elvis before Elvis can find him.Summoning all the powerful elements that have made Robert Crais one of the preeminent crime writers today, The Forgotten Man is a spectacular tour-de-force of suspense and intrigue.From the Hardcover edition.

The great and famous collection assembled by Mrs. Gardner around the turn of the century includes Raphaels, Rembrandts, Botticellis, a Vermeer, a Rubens and one of the most famous Renaissance paintings in the United States, Titian's magnificent The Rape of Europa. Homer, as he listens to the trustees, realizes why the safety of these works of art is in jeopardy. Mrs. Gardner's will stipulates that everything in the museum must stay exactly as it has always been, or the collection will be dismantled.  Homer and security chief Charlie Tibby struggle to bring things to rights, with the help of Titus Moon and his new assistants Polly Swallow and Aurora O'Doyle. And, as their efforts fail, as the problems accelerate, the trustees bring to a vote again and again an apocalyptic question: ""Should the museum be dismantled and its contents sold at auction, in accordance with the stringent terms of Mrs. Gardner's will?""

The 87th Precinct gets a visit from one of the city's most accomplished criminals -- a thief known as the Deaf Man. Because he might be deaf. Or he might not. So little is known about the man who is harassing Detective Steve Carella with puzzling messages that it is hard to tell. But as soon as a pattern emerges, the detectives of the 87th are forced to hit the books and brush up on their Shakespeare -- because each new clue contains a line from one of his works. Unless they can crack the complicated riddles and beat the Deaf Man at his own cat-and-mouse game, someone is going to end up hurt, or something will be stolen -- or both. It's always so hard to tell with the Deaf Man. Ed McBain brings his most intelligent and devious criminal back to the 87th Precinct with a richly plotted and literary crime.

And a series of murders follows, each with a distinct signature, alerting Bennett to the presence of a professional killer with a flair for disguise. Bennett taps his best investigators and sources, and they fan out across the five boroughs. But the leads they're chasing turn out to be phantoms.

Michael Bennett can't tell what's driving the assassin. But he can tell it's personal, and that it's part of something huge. Through twist after twist, he fights to understand exactly how he fits into the killer's plan, before he becomes the ultimate victim"" -- Provided by publisher.

Detectives: book 2  Some virtues are negotiable....  The steamy summer streets of Washington are no match for the phone lines of Fantasy, Inc., where every man's dreams come true. The ""hotline"" works perfectly for its anonymous clients and the teachers and housewives who moonlight as call girls... until a brilliant madman plugs in with twisted passion.  Superstar mystery novelist Grace McCabe needs to unwind after a grueling book tour, and visiting her sister, whom she hasn't seen in months, seems the perfect solution. But Grace is surprised to find the fastidious Kathleen living in a grungy Washington, D.C., neighborhood. Kathleen, reeling from a bitter divorce and the loss of her son, is saving every penny of her teacher's salary to hire a hotshot lawyer for a custody battle. Then Grace discovers that Kathleen is boosting her income with an unlikely profession: as an at-home phone-sex operator. Known as Desiree to the clients of Fantasy, Inc., Kathleen is living life on the edge. Yet how dangerous could it really be? With the ironclad anonymity the agency guarantees its employees, could anyone ever track her down?  Grace finds out one cherry-blossom-scented night when she comes home to find her sister dead, strangled with the cord of her ""special"" phone. Suddenly Grace's life turns into a scene from one of her own books -- the horror, the tight-lipped police, the shattered survivor. Only this time the survivor is Grace herself. But she isn't waiting around for the police to catch up with the killer. Instead she creates a daring trap to lure the killer to her. She  is determined to trap her sister's killer, to bait him with the same seductive voice that triggered his murderous lust...  Her plan goes against every coolheaded instinct of Detective Ed Jackson, the handsome lead investigator on the case. He's read all of Grace's books and might have been the perfect consultant for the one she's working on. They had passion for justice, revenge... and each other. Though in this real-life murder, she's the last complication he needs. He has finally found the love of his life, and lost his professional cool. He's determined to keep Grace out of harm's way, but it's too late. Her trap has already worked. She has aroused the attention of a brilliant madman, and now nothing may be able to protect her from the murderous lust that drives this killer down a path of ecstasy laced with death.  Somewhere in the darkness someone is waiting, listening for the voice that will bring him back to the scene of the crime for one last thrill, promising ecstasy -- and death.

On a chilly February night, during a screening of Psycho in midtown, someone sunk an ice pick into the back of Chanel Rylan's neck, then disappeared quietly into the crowds of drunks and tourists in Times Square. To Chanel's best friend, who had just slipped out of the theater for a moment to take a call, it felt as unreal as the ancient black-and-white movie up on the screen. But Chanel's blood ran red, and her death was anything but fictional. Then, as Eve Dallas puzzles over a homicide that seems carefully planned and yet oddly personal, she receives a tip from an unexpected source: an author of police thrillers who recognizes the crime--from the pages of her own book. Dallas doesn't think it's coincidence, since a recent strangulation of a sex worker resembles a scene from her writing as well. Cops look for patterns of behavior: similar weapons, similar MOs. But this killer seems to find inspiration in someone else's imagination, and if the theory holds, this may be only the second of a long-running series. The good news is that Eve and her billionaire husband Roarke have an excuse to curl up in front of the fireplace with their cat, Galahad, reading mystery stories for research. The bad news is that time is running out before the next victim plays an unwitting role in a murderer's deranged private drama -- and only Eve can put a stop to a creative impulse gone horribly, destructively wrong.""--   Read more Read less",32 Want to read|1 Currently reading|2 Have read

Now nine years after his release from prison, his innocence long forgotten, he’s an ex-con who takes nothing for granted. With his wife Olivia pregnant and the two of them closing on a house in his home town, things are looking up. Until the day Matt gets a shocking, inexplicable video call from Olivia’s phone. And in an instant, the unraveling begins.  A mysterious man who begins tailing Matt turns up dead. A beloved nun is murdered. And local and federal authorities–including homicide investigator, Loren Muse, a childhood schoolmate of Matt’s with a troubled past of her own–see all signs pointing to a former criminal with one murder already under his belt… Matt Hunter. Unwilling to lose everything for a second time, Matt and Olivia are forced outside the law in a desperate attempt to save their future together.

On an island of glitz, in a season of ambition, Philip Randall is getting what everyone wants. A rising career in a big New York law firm. A rich and beautiful wife. A cavernous downtown loft. And enough disposable income to turn Manhattan into a movable feast. So why is Philip testing fate by sleeping with his best friend's wife? And who is the man watching every move Philip makes-and waiting to make a move of his own?It's not that Philip is oblivious to risk-far from it. With his father-in-law's money feathering his nest, with his taste buds accustomed to the best of everything, he knows how far and how fast he could fall. But the thrills he gets from dancing on the edge are too delicious to pass up.Of course, Philip and his lover are always discreet. They use an out-of-the-way hotel, enter separately, and leave apart. Yet for all his caution, Philip doesn't expect this new development: A man from his past, with a massive ax to grind, has come to settle a score-with blackmail.For Philip Randall it's decision time. He can let his sociopathic former pal dismantle a life that has been one big, gluttonous party. Or take out the bastard--and maybe lose the last chance to regain his soul.As witty as it is fiercely suspenseful, this morality tale for our time is a masterful portrait of narcissism veering out of control. And it shows how far some of us will go to leave innocence behind.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team are confronted with a puzzle of impenetrable complexity. A murder has taken place in the offices of the Peverell Press, a venerable London publishing house located in a dramatic mock-Venetian palace on the Thames. The victim is Gerard Etienne, the brilliant but ruthless new managing director, who had vowed to restore the firm's fortunes. Etienne was clearly a man with enemies—a discarded mistress, a rejected and humiliated author, and rebellious colleagues, one of who apparently killed herself a short time earlier. Yet Etienne's death, which occurred under bizarre circumstances, is for Dalgliesh only the beginning of the mystery, as he desperately pursues the search for a killer prepared to strike and strike again.

The smart, saucy sleuth featured in all of Carol Higgins Clark's bestselling novels was last seen in Deck the Halls, the holiday thriller Carol wrote with her mother, Mary Higgins Clark.  Now Regan is in New York to attend a crime conference organized by her celebrity-author mother. A friend, Thomas Pilsner -- the frenetic president of the Settlers' Club on Gramercy Park -- calls Regan, desperately pleading for help. Thomas is distraught over the sudden suspicious deaths of two members of the Settlers' Club. The men had promised to donate a cache of valuable diamonds to save the Club. But now the diamonds are gone, the men are dead, and Thomas is a mess. He fears the police will suspect he is at the heart of both mysteries, and worse yet, he'll lose his job.     Enter Regan. Who better than the star of Decked, Snagged, Iced, and Twanged to solve the mystery of the missing diamonds and suspicious deaths? Who better to contend with the quirky characters around the Club, such as Lydia Sevatura, the self-styled ""Princess of Love,"" who operates a dating service, and her butler, Maldwin Feckles, who has just opened the first school of butlering in New York City? And who better than Carol Higgins Clark, with her sparkling, canny prose, to keep the readers guessing to the end ""who done it""?  Published to coincide with the paperback of Deck the Halls, Fleeced is a witty portrait of modern urban life.

In Salvation Boulevard, P.I. Carl Van Wagener has found a case that tests them all, and then goes on to test his soul. A professor is dead and a suspect-who has confessed-is in custody. But nothing is what it seems. After all, the dead man is an atheist professor, the accused an Islamic foreign student, the defense attorney a Jew, and the detective a Born Again Christian. As Carl gets deeper and deeper into the investigation of the death of professor Nathaniel MacLeod, his most basic beliefs and relationships are tried and his world is turned upside down. The mega-church, the pastor, and his new wife who have redeemed Carl from a life of grim debauchery insist on his dropping the case. But he can't stop searching for the real killer and the truth-no matter what the personal cost. Salvation Boulevard is a page-turning thriller in the tradition of John Grisham and Richard Condon that grapples with the ecstatic and entropic nature of religious faith in contemporary America.

They have been on tour since September, but hopes of a West End transfer have been abandoned and they are all looking forward to the end of the run the following Saturday.Flood is visited that night by his estranged wife, Jenny, now living with wealthy entrepreneur Roger Colborn. Jenny runs a shop in the Lanes and is worried about a strange man who is hanging around outside. Roger has dismissed her concerns but Jenny persuades Toby, for old times' sake, to do something. The next day Flood trails the man and confronts him. Derek Oswin is an unemployed loner who blames Roger Colborn for his father's death from cancer on account of dangerous practices at the now-closed plastics factory run by Roger and his late father, Sir Walter Colborn. However, Oswin is a fan of Flood's and eventually he agrees to lay off. Then, Colborn gets wind of Flood's contact with Jenny and tries to buy him off, but Flood sees only a longed-for opportunity to win Jenny back, and presses for answers to a host of questions surrounding the death of Sir Walter seven years earlier.Before he fully understands the risks he is running, Flood finds himself entangled in the mysterious -- and dangerous -- relationship between the Oswins and the Colborns. The prospects of him surviving until the close of the play suddenly start to look far from good.From the Trade Paperback edition.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For V.I., the journey begins with a national conference in downtown Chicago, where angry protesters are calling for the recovery of Holocaust assets. Replayed on the evening news is the scene of a slight man who has stood up at the conference to tell an astonishing story of a childhood shattered by the Holocaust — a story that has devastating consequences for V.I.’s cherished friend and mentor, Lotty Herschel.  Lotty was a girl of nine when she emigrated from Austria to England, one of a group of children wrenched from their parents and saved from the Nazi terror just before the war broke out. Now stunningly — impossibly — it appears that someone from that long-lost past may have returned.  With the help of a recovered-memory therapist, Paul Radbuka has recently learned his true identity. But is he who he claims to be? Or is he a cunning impostor who has usurped someone else’s history ... a history Lotty has tried to forget for over fifty years?  As a frightened V.I. watches her friend unravel, she sets out to help in the only way she can: by investigating Radbuka’s past. Already working on a difficult case for a poor family cheated of their life insurance, she tries to balance Lotty’s needs with her client’s, only to find that both are spiraling into a whirlpool of international crime that stretches from Switzerland and Germany to Chicago’s South Side.  As the atrocities of the past reach out to engulf the living, V.I. struggles to decide whose memories of a terrible war she can trust, and moves closer to a chilling realization of the truth — a truth that almost destroys her oldest friend.  With fierce emotional power, Sara Paretsky has woven a gripping and morally complex novel of crime and punishment, memory and illusion. Destined to become a suspense classic, Total Recall proves once again the daring and compelling genius of Sara Paretsky.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

FBI Agent Bernadette Saint Clare's gift of sight allows her to see things others can't. But some things are better left unseen.Not always easy to work with, Agent Bernadette Saint Clare has been assigned and reassigned to FBI offices all over the country. Not long after she's placed at a desk in the basement of the off-site St. Paul office, she's called on to do what she does best: use personal effects found at a crime scene to see through a killer's eyes. In some cases her sight has been astoundingly accurate; in others it has been less than perfect. The agent in charge of this case, Tony Garcia, aware of Bernadette's spotty record, is unsure if he should follow her lead, and the tension between them makes for an uneasy alliance. To make things more complicated, she becomes involved with her new upstairs neighbor. But there's something about him she can't quite put her finger on--especially when he offers her a key clue to the killer's identity.A complex novel filled with quirky characters on the right and wrong sides of the law, Blind Spot reminds us that life is filled with leaps of faith both great and small.

His murder in the study of his country house poses a dilemma for the Home Secretary. In the hours before his death, Lord Comstock’s visitors included the government Chief Whip, an Archbishop, and the Assistant Commissioner for Scotland Yard. Suspicion falls upon them all and threatens the impartiality of any police investigation. Abandoning protocol, the Home Secretary invites four famous detectives to solve the case: Mrs Adela Bradley, Sir John Saumarez, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Mr Roger Sheringham. All are different, all are plausible, all are on their own – and none of them can ask a policeman...  To produce this classic whodunit, the Detection Club adopted a completely new approach: Milward Kennedy proposed the title, John Rhode plotted the murder and provided the suspects, and four of their contemporaries were asked to lend their well-known detectives to the task of providing solutions to the crime. But there was to be another twist: the authors would swap detectives and use the characters in their sections of the book. Thus Gladys Mitchell and Helen Simpson swapped Mrs Bradley and Sir John Saumarez, and Dorothy Sayers and Anthony Berkeley swapped Lord Peter Wimsey and Roger Sheringham, enabling the authors to indulge in skilful and sly parodies of each other.  The contributors are: John Rhode, Helen Simpson, Gladys Mitchell, Anthony Berkeley, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Milward Kennedy.   Read more Read less",16 Want to read|0 Currently reading|5 Have read

Now in Kellerman's most compelling and powerful novel yet, L.A. psychologist-detective Alex Delaware confronts a long-unsolved murder of unspeakable brutality--an ice-cold case whose resolution threatens his survival, and that of longtime friend, homicide detective, Milo Sturgis.The nightmare begins when Alex receives a strange package in the mail with no return address. Inside is an ornate album filled with gruesome crime scene photos--a homicide scrapbook entitled The Murder Book. Alex can find no reason for anyone to send him this compendium of death, but when Milo views the book, he is immediately shaken by one of the images: a young woman, tortured, strangled, and dumped near a freeway ramp.This was one of Milo's first cases as a rookie homicide cop: a vicious killing that he failed to solve, because just as he and his training partner began to make headway, the department closed them down. Being forced to abandon the young victim tormented Milo. But his fears prevented him from pursuing the truth, and over the years he managed to forget. Or so he thought.Now, two decades later, someone has chosen to stir up the past. As Alex and Milo set out to uncover what really happened twenty years ago, their every move is followed and their lives are placed in jeopardy. The relentless investigation reaches deep into L.A.'s nerve-centers of power and wealth--past and present. While peeling back layer after layer of ugly secrets, they discover that the murder of one forgotten girl has chilling ramifications that extend far beyond the tragic loss of a single life.A classic story of good and evil, sacrifice and sin, The Murder Book is a gripping page-turner that illuminates the darkest corridors of the human mind.

A burnt-out chair, a peculiar pattern of soot on the walls, an asphyxiated corpse, two footprints, and a collection of discarded cigarette butts bring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers out of their London territory and into conflict with the local investigator whose turf they are invading. Treading carefully, they begin investigating the ripples of shock spreading outward from the crime: from Gabriella Pattern's husband, who knows of his wife's faithlessness and declares himself completely indifferent, to the estranged wife of a member of the national cricket team whose hopes for a reconciliation with her husband have been permanently smashed; from a former lover of Gabriella who has sworn her off to save his marriage, to an angry teenage boy whose holiday with his father was canceled at the crook of a mistress's finger; from a wealthy older widow whose influence has allowed a much younger man to live his dream of playing cricket, to a former prostitute faced with a devastating choice in the wake of a murder whose victim she has never met and yet whose presence has long shadowed her life.  As all of England, as well and the magnetic world of national cricket, discovers itself reeling from the shock of this particular crime, Lynley and Havers find themselves working on the most frustrating case of their careers: the perfect crime. When in an act of desperation Lynley breaks department rules to flush out the killer, he risks being pulled from the case and jeopardizes his career with New Scotland Yard.  In Playing for the Ashes, a deft study of human nature and a crime with too much evidence result in a powerful work of fiction that pulls the reader into a fully created world to explore the dark side of passion and self-delusion.

Twenty-six detective stories by the great Edmund Crispin—a splendid hoard, if sadly posthumous. Most of them feature his don-detective, Gervase Fen, and/or his almost equally sharp-witted friend and (unofficial) colleague, Inspector Humbleby of Scotland Yard. And all of the stories are as taut as a highly strung bow, and score a remarkable series of bull's-eyes. They turn upon a fine assortment of clues—dandelions and hearing aids, Sunday pub closing in Wales, a bloodstained cat, a Leonardo drawing. There are devices and tricks of extraordinary ingenuity—murder by letter, a circular literary forgery. And cleverest of all, perhaps, there are the many variations on faked alibis and switched victims—the alibied corpse that gives the killer an alibi, or the faked alibi that breaks an alibi. There seems no limit to the intricacy of Edmund Crispin's invention or the sparkle of his wit. And certainly none to the sheer delight that his puzzles provide.

And always there was Vermilion whispering in Lindsay's ear:  ""Go!  You must go to Arizona.  Everything you want is waiting for you there.""  Lindsay hadn't listened to Vermilion for years, but now she couldn't shut out her voice.  She knew very well what waited for her in the country of the red rocks.  Her father's murderer was there, as well as the dragon cane.   And Rick lived there too.  Rick, with whom she'd been in love at seventeen, and who had married her older half sister, Sybil.  Nothing but risk awaited her in the Southwest - and possible forbidden love -  but this time she musn't listen to Vermilion.  In Sedona there is an immediate clash with her sister, and Lindsay must try to understand Rick's unhappiness and the trap in which they are both caught.  But first the dark questions must be answered.  About her own mysterious heritage; about her father's death.  She must discover which of her new acquaintances moves behind a mask, and she must find answers that may be concealed in the awful place of the red cliffs.  What she does not expect is that Vermilion will be there too, trying to take over her life, even saving her from harm on occasion - yet always to be feared until the final reckoning.

For many Americans, Ireland is still most closely associated with the movies of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald, the warblings of John McCormack and Carmel Quinn, and a host of other sentimental images--from St. Patrick's Day parades to bawdy limericks and buoyant blessings and ballads.

It is clearly the random work of someone looking for money to buy drugs. But as Davenport looks more closely, he begins to wonder whether the items are actually so small and the victims so random-if there might not be some invisible agenda at work here. Gradually, a pattern begins to emerge, and it leads him to . . . certainly nothing he ever expected.

But he's never forgotten the two children she left behind ... When Aisling Conroy's boyfriend Jack is found in the freezing black waters of the river Corrib, the police tell her it was suicide. A surgical resident, she throws herself into study and work, trying to forget--until Jack's sister Maude shows up. Maude suspects foul play, and she is determined to prove it.

Its cryptic instructions are to deliver ""the valuable Aztec warrior to the rightful owner, a descendant of an Aztec warrior."" What is the valuable object and where is it? What is the name of the owner and where is he? Frank and Joe Hardy have only one slim clue to work with: the name of a complete stranger who can help find the answers. Despite the harassments, the threats, and the attacks made upon them by an unknown, sinister gang, Frank and Joe unravel clue after clue in their adventure-packed search for the living descendant of the mighty Aztec nation which once ruled Mexico. The hunt leads to a marketplace in Mexico City, to the pyramids at Teotihuacan, to the tombs of Oaxaca -- where Chet Morton, the Hardys' pal, is nearly buried alive by foul play. It takes as much high courage as clever deduction for the young detectives to defeat their ruthless foes and to decipher the fascinating secrets of the strange and mysterious will. - Flyleaf.

Evelyn's estranged husband, Steven, a shady owner of a seedy bar, is not at all happy. Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, so Stephanie follows the trail left by Annie and Evelyn-and finds a lot more than she bargained for.  Hard Risk    Steven Soder is somehow linked with a very scary Eddie Abruzzi. Trenton cop and on-again, off-again fiancé Joe Morelli and Stephanie's mentor and tormentor, Ranger, warn Stephanie about Abruzzi, but it's Abruzzi's eyes and mannerisms that frighten Stephanie most. Stephanie needs Ranger's savvy and expertise, and she's willing to accept his help to find Annie even though it might mean getting too involved with Ranger. Stephanie, Ranger, Lula (who's not going to miss riding with Ranger), and Evelyn's lawyer/Laundromat manager set out to find Annie. The search turns out to be a race among Stephanie's posse, the True Blue Bonds' agent-a Rangerette known as Jeanne Ellen Burrows-and the Abruzzi crew. Plus, there's a killer rabbit on the loose!

But that is what Mrs. Gentrie finds in her basement - and even though she tries to dismiss it, it seems to be important for her sister in law.  Meanwhile a man is killed in the house next door (or so it looks - no body is recovered) and another neighbor calls Mason for something that he does not want to disclose. Perry is intrigued so he goes there - and hears a story of old partnership and China, a missing heir and a cranky old man. The client is absolutely annoying - both for the lawyer and for the reader. And something in the story sounds fishy. The code that is found in the empty tin does not help clarify things.  Then a call comes. And Perry Mason ends up finding a body (but decides to leave Drake to report it - which the detective is not very happy about). Before long, Della and Mason will find another body and a link to arms smuggling in the Far East (with WWII already started outside of the US, that has long repercussions for the situation in the world). Add a love story (or 2), some innocent love and some not so innocent one, a heiress that resurfaces and dead men coming back from life complete the story of the mystery.  Tragg and Mason work together to some extent but because of where Perry shows up and mainly when, they both play their own games. And that almost makes the problem unsolvable.  At the end, the truth end up being in front of everyone's eyes - it comes down to one wrong assumption. It is a nicely constructed story - and I want to see where the stories will go when the war really starts.   Read more Read less",14 Want to read|1 Currently reading|5 Have read

The Palm Beach elite go to great lengths to protect their own—and their own no longer includes Elena Estes. Once upon a time a child of wealth and privilege, Elena turned her back on that life. Betrayed and disillusioned by those closest to her, she chose the life of an undercover cop, the hunt for justice her own personal passion. Then a tragic, haunting mistake ended her career. Now Elena exists on the fringes of her old life, training horses for a living. But a shocking event is about to draw her back into the painful vortex she's fought so hard to leave behind.   First she finds the body—a young woman used, murdered, and dumped in a canal. Not just a victim, but a friend. As Elena delves into her dead friend's secret life, she discovers ties not only to the Russian mob but also to a group of powerful and wealthy Palm Beach bad boys known for giving each other alibis to cover a multitude of sins. A group that includes a man Elena once knew very well—her former fiancÃ©, Bennett Walker, a man she knows has already escaped justice at least once in his life.   Finding her friend's killer will put Elena at odds with her old life, with her new lover, and with herself. But she is determined to reveal the truth—a truth that will shock Palm Beach society to its core, and could very well get her killed.

Hay aquí, claro está, historias de vampiros y de fantasmas, como hay historias de alucinados y de inocentes que matan. E historias de niños perversos y de adultos adánicos no menos perversos… La gran virtud de estos cuentos radica en que al final no sabemos quién es más temible, si el vampiro con toda su tradición cultural y libresca, o el inocente que mata precisamente porque quiere ser bondadoso.

In The Murders in the Rue Morgue, Monsieur Dupin is attracted by the strange circumstances of a more than ordinarily horrible murder to which there appears to be no clue. The Parisian police are at a loss, but Dupin, after some quiet investigation of his own, arrives at the solution, ingenious and correct.  The Purloined Letter presents a differ- ent sort of problem, but again Monsieur Dupin, drawing on his deep knowledge of human nature, finds the answer. Rick Schreiter's sensitive illustrations illuminate Poe's provocative stories and make this a volume to cherish.    --front flap   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Born to missionary parents in lawless central Africa, Munroe took up with an infamous gunrunner and his mercenary crew when she was just fourteen. As his protégé, she earned the respect of the jungle's most dangerous men, cultivating her own reputation for years until something sent her running. After almost a decade building a new life and lucrative career from her home base in Dallas, she's never looked back.  Until now.  A Texas oil billionaire has hired her to find his daughter who vanished in Africa four years ago. It’s not her usual line of work, but she can’t resist the challenge. Pulled deep into the mystery of the missing girl, Munroe finds herself back in the lands of her childhood, betrayed, cut off from civilization, and left for dead. If she has any hope of escaping the jungle and the demons that drive her, she must come face-to-face with the past that she’s tried for so long to forget.

His stint in the Army didn't do anything to dissuade him from his belief that justice doesn't come cheap, especially for men like him. ""I thought there might be some justice for a black man if he had money to grease it,"" Easy says. Fired from his job on the line at an aircraft plant, he's in danger of losing his home, symbol of his tenuous hold on middle class status. That's a good enough reason to accept a white man's offer to pay him for finding a beautiful, mysterious Frenchwoman named Daphne Monet, last seen in the company of a well-known gangster. Easy's search takes the reader to an L.A. few writers have shown us before--the mean streets of South Central, the after-hours joints in dirty basement clubs, the cheap hotels and furnished rooms, the places people go when they don't want to be found. Evocative of a past time, and told in a style that's reminiscent of Hammet and Chandler, yet uniquely his own, Mosley's depiction of an inherently decent man in a violent world of intrigue and corruption rang up big sales when it was published in 1990 (although the movie version, with Denzel Washington as Easy, never found the audience it deserved). The minor characters are deftly and brilliantly developed, especially Mouse, who saves Easy's life even as he draws him deeper into the mystery of Daphne Monet. Like many of Mosley's characters, Mouse makes a return appearance in the succeeding Easy Rawlins mysteries, such as A Red Death, Black Betty, and White Butterfly, every one of which is as good as Devil in a Blue Dress, his first. --Jane Adams --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Divided into twelve chapters; the first three chapters serve as an introduction to the basic concepts of digital information processing, its development, limitations and finally introduces some alternative concepts for prospective technologies. Chapters four and five discuss traditional low-dimensional metals and semiconductors and carbon nanostructures respectively, while further chapters discuss Photoelectrochemical photocurrent switching and related phenomena and self-organization and self-assembly. Chapters eight, nine and ten discuss information processing at the molecular level, and eleven describes information processing in natural systems. The book concludes with a discussion of the future prospects for the field.  Further topics: Traditional electronic device development is rapidly approaching a limit, so molecular scale information processing is critical in order to meet increasing demand for high computational power Characterizes chemical systems not according to their chemical nature, but according to their role as prospective information technology elements Covers the application of molecular species and nanostructures as molecular scale logic gates, switches, memories, and complex computing devices   This book will be of particular interest to researchers in nanoelectronics, organic electronics, optoelectronics, chemistry and materials science.

It’s a chilling Christmas greeting for Boston medical examiner Maura Isles and Detective Jane Rizzoli, who swiftly link the victim to controversial celebrity psychiatrist Joyce O’Donnell–Jane’s professional nemesis and member of a sinister cabal called the Mephisto Club.  On top of Beacon Hill, the club’s acolytes devote themselves to the analysis of evil: Can it be explained by science? Does it have a physical presence? Do demons walk the earth? Drawing on a wealth of dark historical data and mysterious religious symbolism, the Mephisto scholars aim to prove a startling theory: that Satan himself exists among us.  With the grisly appearance of a corpse on their doorstep, it’s clear that someone–or something–is indeed prowling the city. The members of the club begin to fear the very subject of their study. Could this maniacal killer be one of their own–or have they inadvertently summoned an evil entity from the darkness?  Delving deep into the most baffling and unusual case of their careers, Maura and Jane embark on a terrifying journey to the very heart of evil, where they encounter a malevolent foe more dangerous than any they have ever faced . . . one whose work is only just beginning.

When she arrives, however, Scarpetta finds that nothing is as she expected: her former lab is in the final stages of demolition; the inept chief isn't the one who requested her after all; her old assistant chief has developed personal problems that he won't reveal; and a glamorous FBI agent, whom Marino dislikes instantly, meddles with the case.Deprived of assistance from colleagues Benton and Lucy, who are embroiled in what first appears to be an unrelated attempted rape by a stalker, Scarpetta is faced with investigating the death of a fourteen-year-old girl, working with the smallest pieces of evidence-traces that only the most thorough hunters can identify.

To clear his name, and clear up the mystery, Van asks friend-in-need Travis McGee to find out what really happened. What McGee finds is that Timber Bay is a tough town to get a break in when you're a stranger asking questions. But what he also finds is that, dead or alive, Hub Lawless is worth a lot of money. Some are eager to get a piece of that action--and some are willing to take more than a piece out of anyone who gets in the way…”  From Goodreads   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|2 Have read

The case fell to the Santa Teresa County Sheriff's Department, but the detectives had little to go on. The woman was young, her hands were bound with a length of wire, there were multiple stab wounds, and her throat had been slashed. After months of investigation, the murder remained unsolved.  That was eighteen years ago. Now the two men who found the body, both nearing the end of long careers in law enforcement, want one last shot at the case. Old and ill, they need someone to help with their legwork and they turn to Kinsey Millhone. They will, they tell her, find closure if they can just identify the victim. Kinsey is intrigued and agrees to the job.  But revisiting the past can be a dangerous business, and what begins with the pursuit of Jane Doe's real identity ends in a high-risk hunt for her killer.  ""Q"" is for Quarry is based on an unsolved homicide that occurred in 1969, and Grafton's interest in the case has generated renewed police efforts. During the past year, the body was exhumed and a nationally known forensic artist did the facial reconstruction that appears in the closing pages of ""Q"" is for Quarry. Both Grafton and the dedicated members of the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department are hoping the photograph will trigger memories that may lead to a positive identification.  On the day Jane Doe was reburied, many officers were at the gravesite. ""It's eerie,"" Grafton writes, ""to think about the power this woman still has. Here we are, thirty-three years later, and she still wants to go home.""   Read more Read less",7 Want to read|1 Currently reading|10 Have read

Her Uncle Harold's bizarre will provides her with a handsome income if she successfully runs his Foundation for Righting Wrongs and pleases its crusty old board of directors. Through Calvin Mason, the young attorney who befriends her, she finds a new ¿hopeless case.  A real hopeless case.  Kevin Shea is a teenage drug addict convicted of holding up a pharmacy and killing the druggist's wife.  Kevin is such a low-life even his mother is convinced he's guilty and glad he's behind bars. Now it appears there was a witness to the murders, a young woman whose prescription was being filled at the time of the murder.  The witness might be able to prove that Kevin is innocent of the murder.  Jane learns that four women with the same name all live in remote areas of Vancouver Island, one of them the missing witness.  There's someone else who wants to find the missing witness too, someone who isn't afraid to turn to murder when Jane gets too close for comfort.  Jane's breath-taking and dangerous romp through the northern wilderness leads her to the Tip Top Club, a stripper bar, where she faces down the clever killer¿and wraps up a satisfactory hopeless case,  proving that everyone deserves justice.

This book addresses the aspects involved in both producing and listening to music from the point of view of cognitive science. Arguments that might appear hard for non-specialists to understand are addressed in a clear and accessible language. An enthralling itinerary through the various aspects of the human relationship with music that underscores how the long path from the first sounds that man has produced and identified in nature through to the most modern compositions are the result of a process of rationalisation gravitating around the multiform relationship between man, the environment and musical creation.

The Field of Musical Improvisation,Marcel Cobussen,music_theory,,/works/OL20931248W,/authors/OL8012005A/Marcel_Cobussen,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Leiden University Press|Language Undetermined,"The central aim of this book is to present a new approach to ?the field of musical improvisation? (FMI), a theory which understands improvisation as a nonlinear dynamic and complex system. The study provocatively argues that during an improvisation more actants are ?at work? than musicians alone: space, acoustics, instruments, audience, technicians, musical and socio-cultural backgrounds, technology, and the like all play a significant role. However, not all of these actants determine every improvisation to the same extent; some are more prominent and active than others in certain situations (periods, styles, cultures, as well as more singular circumstances). Therefore, the FMI theory will prove to be more than a theory dealing with improvisation ?in general?. Rather, FMI emphasizes singularity: each improvisation thus yields a different network of actants and interactions, a unique configuration or assembly.

Soundscapes of the Urban Past,,music_theory,,/works/OL20931537W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  transcript Verlag|Language English,"We cannot simply listen to our urban past. Yet we encounter a rich cultural heritage of city sounds presented in text, radio and film. How can such 'staged sounds' express the changing identities of cities? This volume presents a collection of studies on the staging of Amsterdam,  Berlin and London soundscapes in historical documents, radio plays and films, and offers insights into themes such as film sound theory and museum audio guides. In doing so, this book puts contemporary controversies on urban sound in historical perspective, and contextualises iconic  presentations of cities. It addresses academics, students, and museum workers alike. With contributions by Jasper Aalbers, Karin Bijsterveld, Carolyn Birdsall, Ross Brown, Andrew Crisell, Andreas Fickers, Annelies Jacobs, Evi Karathanasopoulou, Patricia Pisters, Holger Schulze, Mark M.

Noise Thinks the Anthropocene,Aaron Zwintscher,music_theory,,/works/OL20928043W,/authors/OL8010887A/Aaron_Zwintscher,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  punctum books|Language English|Pages 162,"In an increasingly technologized and connected world, it seems as if noise must be increasing. Noise, however, is a complicated term with a complicated history. Noise can be traced through structures of power, theories of knowledge, communication, and scientific practice, as well as through questions of art, sound, and music. Thus, rather than assume that it must be increasing, this work has focused on better understanding the various ways that noise is defined, what that noise can do, and how we can use noise as a strategically political tactic. Noise Thinks the Anthropocene is a textual experiment in noise poetics that uses the growing body of research into noise as source material. It is an experiment in that it results from indeterminate means, alternative grammar, and experimental thinking. The outcome was not predetermined. It uses noise to explain, elucidate, and evoke (akin to other poetic forms) within the textual milieu in a manner that seeks to be less determinate and more improvisational than conventional writing. Noise Thinks the Anthropocene argues that noise poetics is a necessary form for addressing political inequality, coexistence with the (nonhuman) other, the ecological crisis, and sustainability because it approaches these issues as a system of interconnected fragments and excesses and thus has the potential to reach or envision solutions in novel ways.

Therefore, different viewpoints are brought together, the focus lies, besides traditional source analysis, on methods and approaches of historical performance practice und historically informed music theory. What were the different esthetical viewpoints on pianistic improvisation? What were the standard models and conventional designs of improvised piano music of that time? How was improvisation taught? How can the conflict between generic approaches and the ideal of unmistakable individuality of the performer be described? Therefore, a variety of sources is examined by the contributors to this volume: italian partimenti, composed music that is guided by improvisational thinking (like Fantasia and Capriccio) textbooks, teaching documents, concert reports etc.. Besides the outstanding significance of Beethoven as improviser (already noted and admired by his contemporaries), this anthology tries to give a fuller picture by sheding light on then well-known figures like Ciacomo Tritto, Carl Czerny, Joseph Preindl, Joseph Lipavsky, Justin Heinrich Knecht and others.

Beneath all the enormously different styles of modern electronic music lie certain fundamentals of the musical language that are exactly the same no matter what kind of music you write. It is very important to acquire an understanding of these fundamentals if you are to develop as a musician and music producer. Put simply, you need to know what you are doing with regard to the music that you are writing. Music Theory for Computer Musicians explains these music theory fundamentals in the most simple and accessible way possible. Concepts are taught using the MIDI keyboard environment and todayÂ’s computer composing and recording software. By reading this book and following the exercises contained within it, you, the aspiring music producer/computer musician, will find yourself making great progress toward understanding and using these fundamentals of the music language. The result will be a great improvement in your ability to write and produce your own original music!  ABOUT THE AUTHOR    Dr. michael hewitt was born in South Wales in the United Kingdom. He earned his bachelor of music degree at London University and a masterÂ’s degree and doctorate at the University of North Wales, Bangor, where he specialized in musical composition. He is a classically trained musician, composer, lecturer, and author on musical subjects. He also writes classical scores as well as soundtracks for various television productions both at home and abroad. He is currently working as a music technology tutor at Coleg Harlech in North Wales.   Read more Read less",12 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

La musique au coeur des enjeux de la société française (1896-1956),Michèle Alten,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL32763528W,/authors/OL4933945A/Michèle_Alten,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  L'Harmattan|Language French|Pages 139,"""Le développement de l'industrie culturelle à la fin du XXe siècle conduit aujourd'hui au triomphe d'une consommation musicale éclectique et éphémère, fondée sur la fabrication d'événements sans cesse renouvelés. Ce processus privilégie le divertissement et entraîne la promotion d'artistes peu enclins à considérer les activités musicales comme porteuses de sens et de valeurs. À l'inverse, dans la France de la fin du XIXe siècle et du premier XXe siècle, plusieurs musiciens et intellectuels se sont mobilisés pour impliquer directement la musique dans les enjeux de société. À travers six études de cas, cet ouvrage se propose de faire revivre ces expériences musicales passées et de mettre en lumière les différentes modalités d'articulation entre vie musicale et vie sociale. Ces études sont regroupées autour des trois grands types d'engagement sociétal majeurs de la période : ce peut être une volonté protestataire, qui choisit la musique pour exprimer la révolte et le désir d'une société plus juste Chansons rouges de Maurice Boukay ; parti communiste et vie musicale après-guerre ; c'est aussi la défense des valeurs spirituelles chrétiennes, qui peut générer des dynamiques musicales importantes Schola Cantorum ; À Coeur Joie ; c'est enfin l'attachement à un civisme éducatif, garant de la transmission des savoirs musicaux ? inspection générale de l'enseignement primaire dans les années 1930 ; Conservatoire de Paris sous l'Occupation. Dans tous les cas, éthique de conviction et éthique de responsabilité, fondées sur la détermination des hommes, sont à l'oeuvre pour donner à la musique une portée sociale. Malgré la diversité de leurs positionnements et de leurs actions, une même volonté de faire et de faire face anime ces hommes et dessine un horizon qui exclut la soumission à l'ordre établi et aspire à une humanité réconciliée dans la musique.""--Page 4 of cover.
