When things didn't go his way, he always looked for someone to blame. After Germany was defeated in World War I, Hitler became determined to rebuild it into the most feared power on Earth. At the heart of Hitler's determination was an evil plan to destroy those he blamed for Germany's loss--the Jewish people. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Japanese armies swept through China and the Pacific, taking over lands and terrorizing citizens of the conquered countries. Before long, Japan and Germany joined forces, believing that nothing could bring them down. However, those who believed in freedom and justice also joined forces. Soon the world was in a war of unimaginable death and destruction. In the end, the evil would be defeated.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is instead an introductory survey of American film history, dealing in general terms with the film pioneers, the great film landmarks, the technological changes through the years, and the different trends and cycles the movies have undergone.    Those interested in film history and/or film art today have a great advantage over those seeking information only ten years ago. Today there is a renewed invest in, and availability of, films of the past. Almost all of the films of the thirties are to be seen again, either in the theater or on television. Even many of the great silents have been revived. Most of the pictures mentioned in this book can be seen again today; not always easily it's true; but they are there.    However, be forewarned. Television can offer a distorted view of films of the past. Many are so badly cut to fit into preplanned time slots that they are hardly representative of their original versions. Too, television is a great leveller—the good films seem much less good, and the bad films often seem much better than they are. A very talkative, static stage adaptation may seem good just because it is by its very nature well suited to the television screen. And a cheaply made film can have its cheapness hidden by the small screen. Conversely, the merits of a huge spectacle film, or one noted for its camera work, may be almost lost when the small television screen distorts and changes the original image. Certain comedies which depend on the steadily building laughter of a large audience and are paced to allow time for that laughter, seem curiously flat and unfunny on television. Participating audience reaction is often quite as important an ingredient as a key performance or outstanding photography.    So, if you study films on television, form your own opinions, but if a much praised film disappoints you, be prepared to withhold a final judgment until you can see it on a movie screen.
