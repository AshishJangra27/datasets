In addition, this lengthy and complex work contains a vast amount of information on other topics, including the journey of Alexander the Great, cultic history, the history of the eastern Mediterranean in the first century BC, and women's history. Modern knowledge of seminal geographical authors such as Eratosthenes and Hipparchos relies almost totally on Strabo's use of them. This is the first complete English translation in nearly a century, and the first to make use of recent scholarship on the Greek text itself and on the history of geography. The translation is supplemented by a detailed discussion of Strabo's life and his purpose in writing the Geography, as well as the sources that he used.

Because liquid crystals form large-scale and regular patterns under the influence of a variety of applied fields they are fruitful materials to study the spontaneous formation and evolution of ordered and disordered patterns. The chapters, each by a noted researcher in the field, briefly summarize the fundamental work done in the 1960s but concentrate on reviewing results from the recent resurgence of interest in the field as well as indicating the direction of current work.

Experts in their respective fields provide in ten contributions detailed surveys of our understanding of different astrophysical environments and their connection to nuclear processes. Special emphasis is given to the interdisciplinar nature of the field: astronomy, nuclear physics, astrophysics and elementary particle physics are equally involved. The topics of the book range from the collection of observational facts with astronomical methods to experimental work and theoretical models to describe the nuclear processes involved in different astrophysical scenarios. Astrophysical models and calculations simulate how nuclear processes contribute to driving the evolution of stars, interstellar matter, and the whole universe.

The first part of the book, Analysis, is devoted to disentangling the substructure of matter. This part shows that experiments designed to uncover the substructures of nuclei and nucleons have a similar conceptual basis, and lead to the present picture of all matter being built out of a small number of elementary building blocks and a small number of fundamental interactions. The second part, Synthesis, shows how the elementary particles may be combined to build hadrons and nuclei. The fundamental interactions which are responsible for the forces in all systems become less and less evident in increasing complex syystems. Such systems are in fact dominated by many-body phenomena. This concise text is based on lectures held at the University of Heidelberg and is well suited for undergraduate courses. It includes numerous exercises with worked answers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Simulating physics helps cutting-edge games distinguish themselves by making virtual objects behave as we expect them to in the real world. Physics engines are the software programs that run these simulations. Building an engine is difficult, however. There are a large number of new developers (and hobbyists) coming into this market who need help through this complex process. Current introductory books are inadequate; they don't bring enough real-world programming experience to the task. There is a need for an introductory book on game physics with solid coding guidance but which limits the math content. Ian Millington brings his extensive professional programming experience to this problem. He has developed games since 1987, has studied AI and mathematics at the PhD level, and founded Mindlathe Ltd., a company that designed and built commercial physics engines. Physics Engine Development carefully describes each step in the creation of a robust, usable physics engine. It introduces the mathematical concepts in a clear and simple manner, keeping to high school level topics and building a physics code library as it goes. Each new concept is explained in diagrams and code to make sure that even the most novice of game programmers understands. The companion CD-ROM includes the source code for a complete physics engine of commercial quality. This book will serve as a introduction to more mathematically advanced books on game physics, such as Dave Eberly's Game Physics.Note: CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included.

On the rostrum, surrounded by jostling physicists and media, was the particle’s retiring namesake—the only person in history to have an existing single particle named for them. Why Peter Higgs? Drawing on years of conversations with Higgs and others, Close illuminates how an unprolific man became one of the world’s most famous scientists. Close finds that scientific competition between people, institutions, and states played as much of a role in making Higgs famous as Higgs’s work did.  A revelatory study of both a scientist and his era, Elusive will remake our understanding of modern physics.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

La lectura exige una formación de bachillerato aproximadamente y —pese a la brevedad del librito— no poca paciencia y voluntad por parte del lector. El autor ha puesto todo su empeño en resaltar con la máxima claridad y sencillez las ideas principales, respetando por lo general el orden y el contexto en que realmente surgieron. En aras de la claridad me pareció inevitable repetirme a menudo, sin reparar lo más mínimo en la elegancia expositiva; me atuve obstinadamente al precepto del genial teórico L. Boltzmann, de dejar la elegancia para los sastres y zapateros. Las dificultades que radican en la teoría propiamente dicha creo no habérselas ocultado al lector, mientras que las bases físicas empíricas de la teoría las he tratado deliberadamente con cierta negligencia, para que al lector alejado de la física no le ocurra lo que al caminante, a quien los árboles no le dejan ver el bosque. Espero que el librito depare a más de uno algunas horas de alegre entretenimiento.  —Albert Einstein, diciembre de 1916 (prólogo).

In Black Bodies and Quantum Cats, science writer Jennifer Ouellette traces key developments in the field, setting descriptions of the fundamentals of physics in their historical context as well as against a broad cultural backdrop. Newton's laws are illustrated via the film Addams Family Values, while Back to the Future demonstrates the finer points of special relativity. Poe's ""The Purloined Letter"" serves to illuminate the mysterious nature of neutrinos, and Jeanette Winterson's novel Gut Symmetries provides an elegant metaphorical framework for string theory.An enchanting and edifying read, Black Bodies and Quantum Cats shows that physics is not an arcane field of study but a profoundly human endeavor—and a fundamental part of our everyday world.

So what does a guy like this do when he wants to face the ultimate test of endurance? He runs 50 marathons in 50 states-in 50 consecutive days.With little more than a road map and a caravan packed with fellow runners and a dedicated crew, Dean set off on a tour that took him through a volcanic canyon in Maui in high humidity and 88-degree heat; to an elevation gain of almost 4,000 feet at the Tecumseh Trail Marathon in Bloomington, Indiana; to a severed moose leg found alongside an Anchorage, Alaska, trail that compelled him to sprint for safety.Now in this heart-pounding book, Dean reveals how he pulled off this unfathomable feat with a determination that defied all physical limitations. But Dean goes beyond the story of the Endurance 50 marathons to share his invaluable secrets and advice for athletes of all levels. These are the tips that kept Dean going during the 1,310 miles he covered and 160,000 calories he burned-while averaging sub-four-hour marathons and often sleeping fewer than four hours each night. Learn how to: ·  Recover more quickly·  Adapt to extreme conditions·  Prevent muscle cramps and overheating·  Pace yourself when you ""hit the wall""·  Stay motivated.  Packed with practical advice and including training regimens, 50/50 will inspire you no matter what your fitness goal is, whether it's simply walking around the block, running a 10K, or completing yet another Ironman.

Read it thoroughly, let it soak into your experience—your body will thank you.""—Thomas Myers, author of Anatomy Trains""Few things are as overlooked and yet absolutely critical to our health and well-being as our posture. Mary Bond offers information, stories, and tools for learning how to stand and move with ease and elegance.""—Judith Hanson Lasater, Ph.D., PT, author of 30 Essential Yoga PosesMany people cause their own back and body pain through their everyday bad postural and movement habits. Many sense that their poor posture is probably the root of the problem, but they are unable to change long-standing habits.In The New Rules of Posture, Mary Bond approaches postural changes from the inside out. She explains that healthy posture comes from a new sense we can learn to feel, not by training our muscles into an ideal shape. Drawing from thirty-five years of helping people improve their bodies, she shows how habitual movement patterns and emotional factors lead to unhealthy posture. She contends that posture is the physical action we take to orient ourselves in relation to situations, emotions, and people; in order to improve our posture, we need to examine both our physical postural traits and the self-expression that underlies the way we sit, stand, and move. The way we walk, she says, is our body's signature.Bond identifies the key anatomical features that impact alignment, particularly in light of our modern sedentary lives, and proposes six zones that help create postural changes: the pelvic floor, the breathing muscles, the abdomen, the hands, the feet, and the head. She offers self-help exercises that enable healthy function in each zone as well as information on basic ergonomics and case histories to inspire us to think about our own habitual movements. This book also is a resource for Pilates, yoga, and dance instructors as well as healthcare professionals in educating people about postural self-care so they can relieve chronic pain and enjoy all life activities with greater ease.MARY BOND has a Master's degree in dance from UCLA and trained with Dr. Ida P. Rolf as a Structural Integration practitioner. She is a movement instructor at the Rolf Institute and teaches movement workshops nationally. The author of Balancing Your Body, she has also published articles in numerous health and fitness magazines. She lives in California.

Last seen in Death of a Minor Character, now the endearingly mischievous and charming Felix Freer once again joins forces with his no-nonsense ex-wife Virginia to tackle their most puzzling and entertaining mystery yet.  It all begins when Virginia's amiable, wealthy neighbor Ann Brightwell--in spite of the decided reluctance of her husband Hubert--invites her young cousin for a stay. The seventeen-year-old Holly Noble has just lost her mother, a famous actress, and Ann's heart goes out to the poor child. With the help of Virginia and Clyde Crendon, the famous mystery writer, Ann does her best to make Holly feel welcome.  At first glance, the girl seems grateful for the invitation and anxious to fit in. But there is something unsettling about Holly's behavior, particularly regarding Felix, who is staying with Virginia while recuperating from a broken leg. But what connection could there possibly be? Of course there was that business of the girl's having been arrested for drug possession, and Felix has certainly been known to keep company with some rather shady characters. But that's all in the past, isn't it?  Then, shortly after her arrival, Holly disappears, the apparent victim of a kidnapping--news which seems particularly distressing to Clyde Crendon. Odd that he should be so concerned. After all, he hardly knew the girl.  As the plot deliciously thickens--including the unfortunate discovery of a body--it becomes clear to Virginia that Felix may be withholding some vital information. But, as usual, Felix isn't talking...just yet.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Macroscopic quantum effects of practical relevance, for example superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect, are also described. Looking to the future, the author discusses the exciting prospects for quantum computing. Physical, rather than formal, explanations are given, and mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum so readers can understand the concepts more easily. Theoretical discussions are combined with a description of the corresponding experimental results. This book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students in quantum theory and quantum optics.

The most common field of application is in microscopy, both of man-made materials (metals, ceramics, composites, etc.) and of biological tissue samples. This book covers the applications and terminology of both fields. Recent emphasis in stereology is concerned with sampling strategies to avoid bias due to directionality and non-uniformity, and these methods are fully covered. So are the classic techniques that measure size distributions, surface curvature, etc., which are widely useful but not discussed in other recent texts. Finally, most stereology is taught as manual procedures using counting and grids, but this text also covers the use of modern desktop computers for image analysis and processing to obtain and interpret the stereological data.

MBE is a high-vacuum technology characterized by relatively low growth temperature, ability to cease or initiate growth abruptly, smoothing of grown surfaces and interfaces on an atomic scale, and the unique facility for in situ analysis of the structural parameters of the growing film. The excellent exploitation parameters of such MBE-produced devices as quantum-well lasers, high electron mobility transistors, and superlattice avalanche photodiodes have caused this technology to be intensively developed. The main text of the book is divided into three parts. The first presents and discusses the more important problems concerning MBE equipment. The second discusses the physico-chemical aspects of the crystallization processes of different materials (mainly semiconductors) and device structures. The third part describes the characterization methods which link the physical properties of the grown film or structures with the technological parameters of the crystallization procedure. Latest achievements in the field are emphasized, such as solid source MBE, including silicon MBE, gas source MBE, especially metalorganic MBE, phase-locked epitaxy and atomic-layer epitaxy, photoassisted molecular layer epitaxy and migration enhanced epitaxy.

Information is given on the cutting of metals and non metals on a wide range of levels from practical advice and processing parameters to explanations of the physical and chemical reactions which take place in the cut zone. In an effort to make the book as readable and informative as possible the subject is treated in a descriptive rather than a mathematical way. The benefit of CO2 Laser Cutting is twofold as it gives practical advice to the operator and technical advice to the researchers or scientist.

Is space-time continuous or broken up like a string of beads? Over the past two millennia, many of our greatest minds—including Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and other current theoreticians—have been gripped by the mystery this puzzle represents.Joseph Mazur, acclaimed author of Euclid in the Rainforest, shows how historic breakthroughs in our understanding of motion shed light on Zeno’s paradox. The orbits of the planets were explained, the laws of motion were revealed, the theory of relativity was discovered—but the basic structure of time and space remained elusive.In the tradition of Fermat’s Enigma and Zero, The Motion Paradox is a lively history of this apparently simple puzzle whose solution—if indeed it can be solved—will reveal nothing less than the fundamental nature of reality.

E.g. coupled visual and acoustic interactions make fireflies flash, crickets chirp, and an audience clap in unison. On the other hand, in distributed systems and networks, it is often necessary for some or all of the nodes to calculate some function of certain parameters, e.g. sink nodes in sensor networks being tasked with calculating the average measurement value of all the sensors or multi-agent systems in which all agents are required to coordinate their speed and direction. When all nodes calculate the same function of the initial values in the system, they are said to reach consensus.^ Such concepts - sometimes also called state agreement, rendezvous, and observer design in control theory - have recently received considerable attention in the computational science and engineering communities. Quite generally, consensus formation among a small group of expert models of an objective process is challenging because the separate models have already been optimized in their own parameter spaces.  The mathematical framework for describing synchronization and consensus in natural and technical sciences is similar and the aim of this book is to provide the first comprehensive work in which synchronization and consensus are presented jointly, thereby allowing the reader to learn about the similarities and differences of the two concepts in both a systematic and application-oriented fashion.^ The ten chapters have been carefully selected so as to reflect the current state-of-the-art of synchronization and consensus in networked systems; in particular two chapters dealing with a novel application of synchronization concepts in machine learning have been included.  The book is aimed at all scientists and engineers, graduate students and practitioners, working in the fields of synchronization and related phenomena.

Tensor Network Contractions,Shi-Ju Ran,physics,First published in 2020,/works/OL23499040W,/authors/OL8908400A/Shi-Ju_Ran,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Springer Nature|Pages 150,"Tensor network is a fundamental mathematical tool with a huge range of applications in physics, such as condensed matter physics, statistic physics, high energy physics, and quantum information sciences. This open access book aims to explain the tensor network contraction approaches in a systematic way, from the basic definitions to the important applications. This book is also useful to those who apply tensor networks in areas beyond physics, such as machine learning and the big-data analysis. Tensor network originates from the numerical renormalization group approach proposed by K. G. Wilson in 1975. Through a rapid development in the last two decades, tensor network has become a powerful numerical tool that can efficiently simulate a wide range of scientific problems, with particular success in quantum many-body physics. Varieties of tensor network algorithms have been proposed for different problems. However, the connections among different algorithms are not well discussed or reviewed. To fill this gap, this book explains the fundamental concepts and basic ideas that connect and/or unify different strategies of the tensor network contraction algorithms. In addition, some of the recent progresses in dealing with tensor decomposition techniques and quantum simulations are also represented in this book to help the readers to better understand tensor network. This open access book is intended for graduated students, but can also be used as a professional book for researchers in the related fields. To understand most of the contents in the book, only basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and linear algebra is required. In order to fully understand some advanced parts, the reader will need to be familiar with notion of condensed matter physics and quantum information, that however are not necessary to understand the main parts of the book. This book is a good source for non-specialists on quantum physics to understand tensor network algorithms and the related mathematics.

Throughout, the emphasis is on the geometric structure of spacetime, rather than the traditional coordinate-dependent approach. Topics covered include flat spacetime (special relativity), Maxwell fields, the energy-momentum tensor, spacetime curvature and gravity, Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, black holes and singularities, and cosmology. All physical assumptions are clearly spelled out and the necessary mathematics is developed along with the physics. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter and key ideas are illustrated with worked examples. Solutions and hints to selected problems are provided at the end of the book. This textbook will enable the student to develop a sound understanding of the theory of general relativity.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To accomplish this goal, the IACs bring together scientists from a wide spectrum of materials science including experiment, theory, modeling, and computation, incorporating a broad range of materials properties. This volume of proceedings contains the papers presented at IAC-2, that took place in Davos, Switzerland, on August 8-13, 1999. The papers in the volume were assembled into the following categories: Microstructural Properties: Ordering, Kinetics and Diffusion; Magnetic Properties and Elastic Properties. The editors have juxtaposed apparently disparate approaches to similar physical processes, in the hope of revealing the dynamic character of the processes under consideration. The hope is to invigorate new kinds of discussion and reveal challenges and new avenues to the description and prediction of properties of materials in the solid state and the conditions that produce them.

The application of an in situ TEM approach in the above-mentioned research provides not only real-time observation but also monitored machining and structural evolvement at the atomic level. In this thesis, the author introduces a CNT tubular nano furnace that can be operated under TEM for investigation of the CNT nucleation mechanism. By studying the nucleation process of CNTs in the presence of various catalysts, including iron-based metallic catalysts and silicon oxide-based non-metallic catalysts, the physical states of the catalysts as well as the nucleation and growth process of CNTs are revealed. Based on the understanding of the nucleation mechanism, the author proposes a hetero-epitaxial growth strategy of CNTs from boron nitride, which provides a new route for the controllable growth of CNTs. In addition, the author presents an electron beam-assisted nanomachining technique and the fabrication of a CNT-clamped MAC prototype device based on this technique. The formation process of CNT-clamped Fe atomic chains (ACs) can be monitored with atomic resolution. The demonstrated quantized conductance and uninfluenced half-metallic properties of Fe ACs indicate that CNTs can be promising nanoscale electrodes or interconnectors for the linking and assembly of nano and subnano structures.

Olympic Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn wants women to stop thinking about ""losing weight fast,"" and instead focus on loving their bodies for what they are and what they can do. Lindsey is a small-town Minnesota girl at heart turned world-champion skier, but that didn't come without hard work. In Strong Is the New Beautiful, Lindsey lays out the never-before-seen training routines and her overall philosophy that have helped her become the best female skier in the world--tailored for women of all shapes and sizes. Lindsey backs up her fitness program with advice on what to eat and how to work out, and kicks readers into high-gear, helping bolster their self-confidence and build a better body image, with the tips and tricks she's learned as a pro.  This is Lindsey's regimen, and she encourages people to take from it what will work for them. She bounced back from injury not by doing every single thing a trainer said, but instead, by thinking about the fitness plan that would work for her, and eating the right foods that would make her feel and get healthy. In Strong Is the New Beautiful, she interweaves her training and diet regimen with compelling stories of her life growing up in the heartland, her love of skiing, the challenges she's faced--including injuries, illness, and depression--and her secrets to wellness, fitness, and recovery,""--Amazon.com.

A short path it may be, but a complicated one, despite the fact that its author presents the formulas with unwonted crystal clarity, relative to such profound mysteries  ... The Lion Path is fathoms deep, although it will be easily comprehended by the already illuminated, especially those who are educated in the studies of astronomy, astrology and mythology. To them, it will be sheer delight, as they discover its never-before-revealed Egyptian secrets of regeneration and immortality. ... Metaphysical beginners, however, may have some difficulty in comprehending this fine work, prepared by one of the world's true Masters and Meta-Magicians.  If you're among these, you needn't trouble yourself with such strict disciplines as the book details. They're not necessary to become immortal. You would be wise to add The Lion Path to your library now for the day when ""the student is ready,"" but you needn't immediately involve yourself with its prismatic pathways until that time comes --- and when it does, you'll know it.  ...

A mathematical framework is established that enables the multiplicative complexity of many common bilinear systems to be determined. Semilinear systems are introduced as a means of determining the multiplicative complexity of the discrete Fourier transform. Complexity results are derived for other discrete transforms such as the cosine and Hartley transforms. Complete proofs of all the major results are included - the book is essentially self-contained. Many examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the theory.   Read more Read less,0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Here, as in similar systems like positronium, muonium and possibly helium, the accuracy of theoretical predictions is comparable to that of experimental measurements. Hence exciting confrontations are possible. This together with expected large experimental improvements explains the strong interest in the symposium held in Pisa in June-July 1988. The resulting book completely covers the precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and hydrogen-like systems, and also discusses aspects of QED and the influence of strong fields.

Originally, the simplest controls were purely mechanical feedback systems; more complex systems required human intervention. At present, most controls are provided by purely electromechanical systems, but there are also many situations in which one needs sophisticated measurements for later analysis. Developments in electronic information processing have over the past few decades far outpaced the developments in the sensors and actuators that provide the input and output of the control systems; as a result, the transducers account for the major part of the expense, mass, and failure points of many modern machines. Improvements in control systems thus depend on a clear and thorough understanding of the principles of transducers. It is the aim of this book to help meet that need. Unlike other treatments of sensors or actuators, this book approaches the devices from the point of view of the fundamental coupling mechanism between the electrical and mechanical behavior. Thus, for example, a solenoid can b used either to detect horizontal motion and position (i.e. as a sensor), or to impose a motion on a piston (i.e. as an actuator); the principles of operation of the solenoid are the same in both cases, and this book thus treats them together. The book begins with a discussion of systems analysis as a tool for modeling transducers. It then turns to a detailed discussion of transduction mechanisms (electric and magnetic fields, piezo- and pyro -electric effects, electromagnetic induction, and so forth). The book concludes with an input/output analysis of transducers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The area has been growing very rapidly since quantum effects in silicon field-effect transistors have become of practical interest. Since the discovery of the quantum Hall effect by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980, this subject has grown exponentially. The book contains 42 invited papers and 37 contributed papers which were presented at the 7th of the traditional Würzburg conferences. For the area of high magnetic fields applied in semiconductor physics recent results are discussed, and the state-of-the-art is reviewed. More than 50% of the papers concern two-dimensional electronic systems. Other subjects of current interest are magneto-optics and magneto transport in three-dimensional semiconductors. Special attention has been paid to the rapidly growing field of semimagnetic semiconductors.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Each of the three days was devoted to a specific topic of some controversy which was highlighted by invited speakers representing opposing views. The comments of the session chairman summarize the intense discussions and point out directions for further research. More specifically, the first day's discussion centered on ""Adsorption-Desorption Kinetics: Dynamics versus Thermodynamics"", with invited contributions by D. Menzel and W. Brenig, and a summary by H.J. Kreuzer. The second day was devoted to ""Precursors: Myth or Reality?"", with major papers by W.H. Weinberg and D. Auerbach. The active discussions were summarized by T. Engel. On the third day, we tried to map out a strategy to study ""Kinetics of Phase Transitions at Surfaces"", with main contributions by K. Heinz and J.D. Gunton, summarized by P.H. Kleban. An overview and outlook was given on the last day by P. Estrup. In all, the proceedings contain 6 invited lectures, summaries and a dozen contributed papers.

This modern and fascinating branch of condensed matter physics is presented from three complementary viewpoints. The first section, written by experimentalists, emphasises the observation of basic phenomena (by light scattering, for example). The second section, written by theoreticians, focuses on the necessary theoretical tools (density functional theory, path integrals, free energy expansions). The third section is devoted to the results of modern simulation techniques (Gibbs ensemble, free energy calculations, configurational bias Monte Carlo). The interplay between the disciplines is clearly illustrated. For all those interested in modern research in equilibrium statistical mechanics.

The book first develops a fundamental understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms before addressing a diversity of practical applications. Wherever possible, theories and types of experimental measurements are discussed and compared for corroboration and to further understanding. In addition, the book incorporates ample experimental data, relevant properties of materials and surfaces, making the book more useful to engineers and scientists working in the field. It is intended for graduate students of tribology and mechanics research workers, and the practicing engineer who needs to solve quickly a tribological or reliability problem. Many of the theories presented are very general and applicable outside magnetic-storage systems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In particular, the recent detections of high-redshift cluster candidates, only possible with the current high-technology instrumentation, add a new dimension to the problem. Along with the ever increasing computing power and sophisticated algorithms to model clusters of galaxies, it may help us to understand the origins of today's groups and clusters, as well as of their member galaxies. These workshop proceedings provide a snapshot of the current research in this subject, covering the observations, theory and numerical simulations relevant to galaxy evolution in groups and clusters. In this book, intended primarily to researchers in the field, particular emphasis is given to the recent impressive progress in the field, on important new results, and on the future prospects and open questions to be tackled.

Response functions and two-photon scattering in trapped atomic Bose gases,David L. Luxat,physics,First published in 2005,/works/OL12796550W,/authors/OL5754656A/David_L._Luxat,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2005|Language English|Pages 184,"In the first half of the thesis, we study the linear response of a trapped 3D Bose-condensed gas to a two-photon Raman scattering probe, in a manner analogous to the tunneling of electrons in metals. The tunneling current is given in terms of the normal and anomalous Green's functions describing atoms. We calculate these normal and anomalous Green's functions within the Bogoliubov-Popov approximation. Our analysis generalizes the work of Burnett and coworkers. We emphasize that ""outcoupled"" atoms from a Bose-condensed gas can be associated with the excitation (as well as the destruction) of a Bogoliubov excitation. We present a detailed numerical calculation of the different components of the tunneling current as a function of the photon energy, for various temperatures. We use the local density approximation (LDA) to treat the trapped gas.In the second half of the thesis, we extend the discussion of response functions to other trapped boson systems. We first study a 1D trapped Bose gas with quasi-long-range order, associated with a quasicondensate. With a Raman outcoupling experiment, we propose that the frequency dependence of the single-particle Green's function can be studied experimentally. This frequency dependent correlation function for the 1D quasicondensate exhibits the expected power law decay at long wavelengths and low energies, modified by the presence of the harmonic trapping potential. In all previous work on 1D trapped Bose gases, only the static (or zero frequency) correlation functions were studied. We next study single-particle and two-particle response functions of a Bose gas with two atomic hyperfine states in an optical lattice and show that these response functions are accessible using a Raman probe. Such a two species interacting Bose gas trapped in a periodic potential has been studied extensively in recent years, but only the thermodynamic properties were considered. Our work is done within a mean-field approximation but this is expected to capture the essential physics. The presence of a nonzero intercomponent order parameter, which is analogous to the XY-ferromagnetic order parameter in spin systems, is shown to exhibit new collective modes that are not present in the usual Mott insulator phase of such a two-component Bose gas. This new order parameter renormalizes the spectrum of the single-particle excitations. We discuss the signatures in the Raman scattering response from these new features of both the single-particle excitations and the two-particle collective modes.

These materials can be used successfully in such applications as electronic devices, optical films, anti-wear and anti-corrosion coatings, thermal barrier coatings and biomaterials. The materials are fabricated with the use of nanoparticles, leading to greatly improved performance. Nanoparticle technology is not straightforward, however, demanding a modification of methods for processing and characterization. This book provides graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, engineers and senior scientists with an in-depth review of aspects of the field, ranging from synthetic methods to a variety of applications. The different approaches to material synthesis are described, giving the reader a better understanding of the complex phenomena involved. Characterization and the evaluation of properties are also discussed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This question gained renewed interest with the discovery in 1964 of CP violation in the decay of the K0 meson. Experimental searches for EDMs have severely constrained the possible theories that describe the CP-violation. The fundamental physical theories put forward to describe the K0 system are described, and application to the calculation of EDMs of the electron, the neutron, atoms, and molecules is thoroughly reviewed. The theoretical description is embellished by a comprehensive review of the experimental seraches for EDMs, along with an overview of likely future experimental trends. The book represents the first complete and simultaneous description of both theoretical and experimental techniques related to the issues of EDMs. It is intended for advanced graduate students who want a solid introduction to the theoretical and experimental issues, and for workers in the field who want a comprehensive review and overview of current work.

One can now compile catalogs of tens or hundreds of millions of stars or galaxies and databases from satellite-based observations are reaching terabit proportions. This wealth of data gives rise to statistical challenges not previously encountered in astronomy. This book is the result of a workshop held at Pennsylvania State University in August 1991 that brought together leading astronomers and statisticians to consider statistical challenges encountered in modern astronomical research. The chapters have all been thoroughly revised in the light of the discussions at the conference, and some of the lively discussion is recorded here as well.

Prelas,physics,First published in 1995,/works/OL19911148W?edition=ia%3Awidebandgapelect00popo,/authors/OL2871009A/Mark_A._Prelas,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27095815M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1995|Publisher  Springer Netherlands|Language English|Pages 531,"Wide Band Gap Electronic Materials covers topics including electronic doping of diamond, n-type diamond, negative electron affinity of diamond, applications of aluminum nitride, the doping of boron nitride, wide band gap electronic applications, and nanophase diamond. One of the highlights is the description of an energy sub-band due to defects in the diamond lattice, responsible for a diamond LED which can emit red, green and blue light. Revolutionary nanostructure devices are also described, such as nanostructure transistors. It is also shown how aluminum nitride can be used in acoustic, piezo and electroluminescent devices. Nanophase diamond particles having a narrow size distribution around 4 nm can be created by an explosive shock wave, and these can be used as seeds for growing smooth diamond films, as additives in composite materials, for nanophase electronic devices, and as the basis for superior lubricants. Other problems covered include the heteroepitaxy of diamond films, doping of aluminum nitride, and the growth of large crystals of boron nitride.

In his newest volume, he takes on a fundamental concept of modern physics: nothing. The physics of stuff--protons, neutrons, electrons, and even quarks and gluons--is at least somewhat familiar to most of us. But what about the physics of nothing? Isaac Newton thought of empty space as nothingness extended in all directions, a kind of theater in which physics could unfold. But both quantum theory and relativity tell us that Newton's picture can't be right. Nothing, it turns out, is an awful lot like something, with a structure and properties every bit as complex and mysterious as matter. In his signature lively prose, Weatherall explores the very nature of empty space--and solidifies his reputation as a science writer to watch.

Cellular Automata and Modeling of Complex Physical Systems,Paul Manneville,physics,First published in 1989,/works/OL19833630W?edition=ia%3Acellularautomata1989mann,/authors/OL3045666A/Paul_Manneville,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27023506M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1989|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Language English|Pages 319,"Cellular automata are fully discrete dynamical systems with dynamical variables defined at the nodes of a lattice and taking values in a finite set. Application of a local transition rule at each lattice site generates the dynamics. The interpretation of systems with a large number of degrees of freedom in terms of lattice gases has received considerable attention recently due to the many applications of this approach, e.g. for simulating fluid flows under nearly realistic conditions, for modeling complex microscopic natural phenomena such as diffusion-reaction or catalysis, and for analysis of pattern-forming systems. The discussion in this book covers aspects of cellular automata theory related to general problems of information theory and statistical physics, lattice gas theory, direct applications, problems arising in the modeling of microscopic physical processes, complex macroscopic behavior (mostly in connection with turbulence), and the design of special-purpose computers.

These intermediate-scale structures often arise from competing interactions operating on different length scales within the material. Our understanding of such phenomena has increased substantially with the identification and theoretical description of solid-state materials with incommensurate and long-period modulated phases, such as ferroelectrics, charge-density-wave compounds, epitaxial layers and polytypes. Experimental diagnosis of inhomogeneous ground states and metastable phases has advanced so far that these are now well-accepted phenomena. These proceedings bring together the work of physicists and materials scientists to review developments in this area and to examine possible future directions, such as how the microscopic understanding emerging in bench-top solid-state systems can be applied in materials science.

As all schools are now obliged to undertake risk management, this book addresses a very real need. Safety and Risk in Primary Physical Education gives a comprehensive coverage of all aspects of safety in PE in primary schools, including· the school's and teachers' legal responsibilities· policies on good practice and risk· pupil readiness· equipment and the environment· each subject area included in the National Curriculum; Gymnastics, games, dance, athletics, outdoor and adventurous activities and swimming· checklists of key points for safe practice.

First there are the general presentations ofTh. De Donder (nos. 8, 14, 43, 58), and then those more specifically devoted to Einsteinian gravitation - notably Georges Darmois's contribution (no. 25) and that of J. Haag (no. 46) on the Schwarzschild problem. The present fascicule takes its place alongside the two latter monographs, but it has been conceived and composed in such a way that it may be read and understood by anyone with a knowledge of the principles of Absolute Differential Calculus and of Relativity - either from the original exposi tions of Einstein, Weyl, or Eddington, or, in French, from Cartan's excel 2 lent works (for everything having to do with mathematical theories) and 3 from Chazy's (for Relativity and Celestial Mechanics), or naturally from Levi-Civita's The Absolute Differential Calculus (first edition, London and Glasgow, Blackie and Son, 1927) where the two original papers written in Italian are brought together: namely, Calcolo differenziale assoluto and Fondamenti di meccanica relativistica (Bologna, Zanichelli). As for the present fascicule, it is hardly necessary to point out that, as its title indicates, we seek to establish in the simplest possible terms the rela tivistic aspect of what Newton and those who followed him regarded as the key to ordinary Celestial Mechanics.

Moreover, as this field gets only limited attention in most general books on luminescence, there is a clear need for a book in which attention is specifically directed toward this rapidly growing field of solid state lighting and its many applications. This book is aimed at providing a sound introduction to the synthesis and optical characterization of phosphate phosphor for undergraduate and graduate students as well as teachers and researchers. The book provides guidance through the multidisciplinary field of solid state lighting specially phosphate phosphors for beginners, scientists and engineers from universities, research organizations, and especially industry. In order to make it useful for a wide audience, both fundamentals and applications are discussed, together.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We follow one of physics and science history's most enigmatic phenomena, superconductivity, through 100 years, from its discovery in 1911 to the present, not as a history book in the usual sense, but through close ups of the leading characters and their role in that story, the Nobel laureates, who were still among us in the years 2001-2004 when the main round of interviews was carried out. Since then two of them already passed away. For each one of the 10 laureates, the author tells their story by direct quotation from interviews in their own words. Each chapter treats one laureate. The author first gives a brief account of the laureates' scientific background and main contribution. Then each laureate tells his own story in his own words. This book is unique in its approach to science history.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Several counterpart 3d transition-metal oxides were adopted as model systems suitable for examining the mechanisms involved, and their electronic structures were systematically investigated using three main spectroscopy methods. Comparative studies on the charge dynamics and Mott transition features of transition-metal oxides were performed: Charge dynamics and thermoelectricity in a typical Mott transition system La1-XSrXVO3, charge dynamics in a doped valence-bond solid system (Ti1−xVx)2O3 and in layered nickelates R2-xSrxNiO4 with charge-ordering instability are investigated thoroughly. The results obtained successfully provide a number of novel insights into the emergent phenomena near the Mott transition.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book is a concise introduction to quantum computation, developing the basic elements of this new branch of computational theory without assuming any background in physics. It begins with an introduction to the quantum theory from a computer-science perspective. It illustrates the quantum-computational approach with several elementary examples of quantum speed-up, before moving to the major applications: Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and quantum error correction. The book is intended primarily for computer scientists who know nothing about quantum theory, but will also be of interest to physicists who want to learn the theory of quantum computation, and philosophers of science interested in quantum foundational issues. It evolved during six years of teaching the subject to undergraduates and graduate students in computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics, at Cornell University.

Nanotechnology and global sustainability,Donald Maclurcan,physics,First published in 2011,/works/OL16298787W,/authors/OL7040168A/Donald_Maclurcan,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  CRC Press|Language English,"""The rise of collaborative consumption, peer-to-peer systems, and not-for-profit social enterprise heralds the emergence of a new era of human collectivity. Increasingly, this consolidation stems from an understanding that big-banner issues such as climate change are not the root causes of our present global predicament. There is a growing and collective view that issues such as this are actually symptoms of a much more vicious, seemingly insurmountable condition: our addiction to economic, consumption, and population growth in a world of finite resources.Nanotechnology and Global Sustainability uses nanotechnology the product of applied scientific knowledge to control and utilize matter at atomic and molecular scales as a lens through which to explore the interrelationship between innovation, politics, economy, and sustainability. This groundbreaking book addresses how stakeholders can actively reshape agendas to create positive and sustainable futures through this latest controversial, cross-sectoral technology. It moves beyond issues of efficiency, productivity, and utility, exploring the insights of 22 contributors from around the world, whose work spans the disciplines of science and the humanities. Their combined knowledge, reinforced with various case studies, introduces an exciting prospect how we can innovate without economic growth.This new volume in the Perspectives in Nanotechnology series is edited by Dr. Donald Maclurcan and Dr. Natalia Radywyl. Dr. Maclurcan is a social innovator and Honorary Research Fellow with the Institute for Nanoscale Technology at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. Dr. Radywyl is a social researcher and Honorary Research Fellow in the School of Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne, Australia. She is also an Adjunct Research Fellow in the Faculty of Life and Social Sciences at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne. This book is written for a wide audience and will be of particular interest to activists, scholars, policy makers, scientists, business professionals, and others who seek an understanding of how we might justly transition to sustainable societies""--  ""Foreword Vijoleta Braach-Maksvytis When Donnie Maclurcan approached me in 2004 to help guide some of his groundbreaking PhD research on the societal implications of nanotechnology, I was delighted to discover a like-minded colleague who shared such a consideration. As his PhD conclusions sharpened, Donnie was already beginning to collate the work of others into a volume that would take his dissertation findings about nanotechnology and global inequity one step further. With a steadfastness of vision, unswerving integrity, and belief in the better characteristics of us as global peoples, this book was created. Yet this work has much deeper foundations. In the late 1950s, the field of nanotechnology was foreshowed with Nobel Laureate physicist Richard Feynman's dream of taking advantage of a ""new world"" available at the nanoscale--the level of atoms and small molecules. What is it about nanoscience that has created so much attention? It has opened a world of new materials and properties simply by the reduced dimensions of familiar materials on the nanoscale. This is because of three main characteristics: The nanoscale is the scale of nature's building blocks, such as DNA and proteins; at this scale, materials have more surface than volume, increasing the importance of surface-interaction properties; and, at nanoscale, the effects of quantum physics begin to dominate over classical physics. Take, for example, the simple interaction of light with gold metal. Light on a golden wedding ring tells us that gold is gold colored. Light interacting with a 20 nanometer-sized nanoparticle of gold tells us that gold has a deep red color--not a trace of gold in sight! It was not until the early 1990s that Feynman's dream became a frontier science and, even then,""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Every second of every day and night, many trillions of neutrinos pass through your body. But most people had never heard of them until they made headlines recently for possibly travelling faster than light. Luckily, these ghostly particles -- celebrated in a delightful John Updike poem -- do no harm and leave no trace. They are so difficult to pin down that scientists must use Olympic-size pools of cleaning fluid deep underground and kilometre-thick sheets of Antarctic ice to catch just a handful. Yet the shadowy neutrinos hold the key to unlocking some of the biggest mysteries of the universe: What was the universe like seconds after the Big Bang? Why is anti-matter so rare? What triggers exploding stars? Ray Jayawardhana tells us that neutrino research is now entering a brave new era and explains why these pathologically shy particles may spark a revolution in physics.

Walking all night, by dawn he had wrestled with an idea that would transform the whole of science and our very conception of the world.  In Helgoland Carlo Rovelli tells the story of the birth of quantum physics and its bright young founders who were to become some of the most famous Nobel winners in science. It is a celebration of youthful rebellion and intellectual revolution. An invitation to a magical place.  Here Rovelli illuminates competing interpretations of this science and offers his own original view, describing the world we touch as a fabric woven by relations. Where we, as every other thing around us, exist in our interactions with one another, in a never-ending game of mirrors.  A dazzling work from one of our most celebrated scientists and master storyteller, Helgoland transports us to dizzying heights, reminding us of the many pleasures of the life of the mind.

Simultaneously, huge progress has been achieved in microscopy. These circumstances underline the need for a reference that delineates the differences of various types of nanostructures in multiphase polymer-based materials. Multiphase Polymer-Based Materials: An Atlas of Phase Morphology at the Nano and Micro Scale presents up-to-date coverage of developments in this field in a practical and easy to use format.     Illustrates Microscopic Tools for Phase Morphology Investigation  The author sifted through an encyclopedic amount of information to provide a selection of more than 550 microscopy pictures resulting from the observation of multiphase polymer-based materials. These illustrations include micro and nanopolymer blends, micro and nanocomposites, micro and nano phases in copolymers, thermosets, and thermoplastic blends that were intensively developed over the past decade. Each picture includes a detailed explanation of how to attain these materials, how the samples were prepared, and how the observations were conducted.  A Practical Straightforward Approach to Microscopic Observation  The book examines the various microscopic tools employed for the investigation of the phase morphology, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each. It provides a practical, straightforward approach for dealing with the microscopic observation of phase morphology in multicomponent polymer blends and nanocomposites.

In string theory, D-branes are a class of extended objects upon which open strings can end with Dirichlet boundary conditions, after which they are named.  D-branes are typically classified by their spatial dimension, which is indicated by a number written after the ""D.""   A ""D0-brane"" is a single point, a ""D1-brane"" is a line (sometimes called a ""D-string""), a ""D2-brane"" is a plane, and a ""D25-brane"" fills the highest-dimensional space considered in ""Bosonic string theory."" There are also ""instantonic D(–1)-branes,"" which are localized in both space and time.  D-branes were discovered by Dai, Leigh and Polchinski, and independently by Hořava in 1989.  Author Biography Clifford V. Johnson obtained his BSc in physics at Imperial College, University of London, and his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Southampton.

Throughout her career, Cameron Diaz has been a role model for millions of women. By her own candid admission, though, this fit, glamorous, but down to earth star was not always health conscious. Learning about the inseparable link between nutrition and the body was just one of the life changing lessons that has fed Camerons hunger to educate herself about the best ways to feed, move, and care for her body. In The Body Book, she shares what she has learned and continues to discover about nutrition, exercise, and the mind and body connection. Grounded in science and informed by real life, The Body Book offers a comprehensive overview of the human body and mind, from the cellular level up. From demystifying and debunking the hype around food groups to explaining the value of vitamins and minerals, readers will discover why it is so important to embrace the instinct of hunger and to satisfy it with whole, nutrient dense foods. Cameron also explains the essential role of movement, the importance of muscle and bone strength and why we need to sweat a little every day. The Body Book does not set goals to reach in seven days or thirty days or a year. It offers a holistic, long term approach to making consistent choices and reaching the ultimate goal: a long, strong, happy, healthy life.

Traditionally, the constituents of matter (fermions) were regarded as different from the particles (bosons) transmitting the forces between them. In supersymmetry, fermions and bosons are unified. Intended for graduate students in particle physics, and researchers in experimental and phenomenological supersymmetry, this is the first textbook to provide a simple introduction to a previously formidably technical field. Its elementary, practical treatment brings readers to the frontier of contemporary research, in particular the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. Theories are constructed through an intuitive 'trial and error' approach. Basic elements of spinor formalism and superfields are introduced, allowing readers to access more advanced treatments. Emphasis is placed on physical understanding, and on detailed derivations of important steps. Many short exercises are included, making for a valuable and accessible self-study tool.

The updated reference monograph is intended as a guide for researchers and graduate students who are seeking a comprehensive treatment of the design of instruments and beam-guiding systems of charged particles and their propagation in electromagnetic fields. Wave aspects are included in this edition for explaining electron holography, the Aharanov-Bohm effect and the resolution of electron microscopes limited by diffraction. Several methods for calculating the electromagnetic field are presented and procedures are outlined for calculating the properties of systems with arbitrarily curved axis. Detailed methods are presented for designing and optimizing special components such as aberration correctors, spectrometers, energy filters monochromators, ion traps, electron mirrors and cathode lenses. In particular, the optics of rotationally symmetric lenses, quadrupoles, and systems composed of these elements are discussed extensively. Beam properties such as emittance, brightness, transmissivity and the formation of caustics are outlined. Relativistic motion and spin precession of the electron are treated in a covariant way by introducing the Lorentz-invariant universal time and by extending Hamilton’s principle from three to four spatial dimensions where the laboratory time is considered as the fourth pseudo-spatial coordinate. Using this procedure and introducing the self action of the electron, its accompanying electromagnetic field and its radiation field are calculated for arbitrary motion. In addition, the Stern-Gerlach effect is revisited for atomic and free electrons.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

The approach taken is to emphasize the physics of how devices work and how they can be (and have been) used in various applications. Mathematical derivations and the development of design equations are provided where necessary to explain phenomena and engineering principles, but a strong effort has been made to not obscure important concepts with mathematical details. Illustrations and references from technical journals have been used to demonstrate the relevance of the theory to currently important topics in industry. By reading this book, scientists, engineers, students and enginering managers can obtain an overall view of the theory and the most recent technology in Integrated Optics. In this fifth edition all chapters have been revised and updated. The chapters on Polymer and Fiber Integrated Optics, Optical Amplifiers, Micro-Optical-Electro-Mechanical Devices, and Photonic and Microwave Wireless Systems are completely new. Problems help the students to deepen their knowledge.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It discusses a broad spectrum of experimental and theoretical activity in particle physics, from the searches for the Higgs boson and physics beyond the Standard Model to studies of quantum chromodynamics, the B-physics sector, and the properties of dense hadronic matter in heavy-ion collisions.Covering the topics in a pedagogical manner, the book introduces the theoretical and phenomenological framework of hadron collisions and presents the current theoretical models of frontier physics. It offers overviews of the main detector components, the initial calibration procedures, and search strategies. The authors also provide explicit examples of physics analyses drawn from the recently shut down Tevatron. In the coming years, or perhaps even sooner, the LHC experiments may reveal the Higgs boson and offer insight beyond the Standard Model. Written by some of the most prominent and active researchers in particle physics, this volume equips new physicists with the theory and tools needed to understand the various LHC experiments and prepares them to make future contributions to the field""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the clock-like motions of the planets to the catastrophic collapse of a star into a black hole, gravity controls the Universe. Gravity is central to modern physics, helping to answer the deepest questions about the nature of time, the origin of the Universe and the unification of the forces of nature. Linking key experiments and observations through careful physical reasoning, the author builds the reader's insight step-by-step from simple but profound facts about gravity on Earth to the frontiers of research. Topics covered include the nature of stars and galaxies, the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy, black holes, gravitational waves, inflation and the Big Bang. Suitable for general readers and for undergraduate courses, the treatment uses only high-school level mathematics, supplemented by optional computer programs, to explain the laws of physics governing gravity.

How does latitude indicate the type of climate a specific place will have? Where are volcanic eruptions or strong earthquakes most likely to occur? With Physical Geography: A Self-Teaching Guide, you'll discover the answers to these questions and many more about the basics of how our planet operates.    Veteran geography teacher Michael Craghan takes you on a guided tour of Earth's surface, explaining our planet's systems and cycles and their complex interactions step by step. From seasonal changes to coastal processes, from effluvial basins to deep sea fissures, Craghan puts the emphasis on comprehension of the topics. He also includes more than 100 specially commissioned illustrations and 50 photographs to help clarify difficult concepts. The clearly structured format of Physical Geography makes it fully accessible, providing an easily understood, comprehensive overview for everyone from the student to the amateur geographer to the hobbyist.    Like all Self-Teaching Guides, Physical Geography allows you to build gradually on what you have learned-at your own pace. Questions and self-tests reinforce the information in each chapter and allow you to skip ahead or focus on specific areas of concern. Packed with useful, up-to-date information, this clear, concise volume is a valuable learning tool and reference source for anyone who wants to improve his or her understanding of physical geography.

Brian Ridley's book sets out to survey in simple, non-mathematical terms what physics has to say about the fundamental structure of the universe. He deals with all the basic concepts of modern physics: elementary particles, black holes, gravity, quantum theory, time, mass, relativity and energy; this new edition also includes coverage of more recently emerging ideas including strings, imaginary time and chaos. Ridley's clear and witty account gives an exciting introduction to the non-specialist while offering a fresh perspective to scientists themselves.

The emphasis is on applications and understanding, on theorems and techniques actually used in research. The text is not a comprehensive text in probability and statistics; proofs are sometimes omitted if they do not contribute to intuition in understanding the theorem. The problems, some with worked solutions, introduce the student to the use of computers; occasional reference is made to routines available in the CERN library, but other systems, such as Maple, can also be used. Topics covered include: basic concepts; definitions; some simple results independent of specific distributions; discrete distributions; the normal and other continuous distributions; generating and characteristic functions; the Monte Carlo method and computer simulations; multi-dimensional distributions; the central limit theorem; inverse probability and confidence belts; estimation methods; curve fitting and likelihood ratios; interpolating functions; fitting data with constraints; robust estimation methods. This second edition introduces a new method for dealing with small samples, such as may arise in search experiments, when the data are of low probability. It also includes a new chapter on queuing problems (including a simple, but useful buffer length example). In addition new sections discuss over- and under-coverage using confidence belts, the extended maximum-likelihood method, the use of confidence belts for discrete distributions, estimation of correlation coefficients, and the effective variance method for fitting y = f(x) when both x and y have measurement errors.

Quantum theory at the crossroads: reconsidering the 1927 Solvay conference,Guido Bacciagaluppi,physics,First published in 2008,/works/OL11947107W?edition=ia%3Aquantumtheoryatc00bacc_407,/authors/OL5136674A/Guido_Bacciagaluppi,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16842076M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"The 1927 Solvay conference was perhaps the most important in the history of quantum theory. Contrary to popular belief, questions of interpretation were not settled at this conference. Instead, a range of sharply conflicting views were extensively discussed, including de Broglie's pilot-wave theory (which de Broglie presented for a many-body system), Born and Heisenberg's ""quantum mechanics"" (which apparently lacked wave function collapse or fundamental time evolution), and Schrödinger's wave mechanics. Today, there is no longer a dominant interpretation of quantum theory, so it is important to re-evaluate the historical sources and keep the debate open. This book contains a complete translation of the original proceedings, with essays on the three main interpretations presented, and a detailed analysis of the lectures and discussions in the light of current research. This book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in physics and in the history and philosophy of quantum theory. - Publisher.

In contrast to common textbooks of quantum mechanics, modern experiments are described both for the purpose of foundation of the theory and in relation to recent applications. In this respect applications to nano-electronics as well as the realization of quantum-bits are presented and discussed. Furthermore, links are made to other important research fields and applications, such as elementary particle physics, solid state physics and nuclear magnetic resonance tomography in medicine. Even though the representation of the topics is largely performed in terms of Dirac´s bra-ket notation and by use of commutator algebra, the concrete description of the physical basis and the corresponding theoretical concepts are emphasized. Because of little requirement of complex mathematics, the book is suitable as an introduction into quantum physics, not only for physicists but also for chemists, biologists, engineers, computer scientists and even for philosophers as far as they are interested in natural philosophy and epistomology.

Focusing on the physics of acoustic waves, their propagation, technology, and applications, this accessible overview of ultrasonics includes accounts of viscoelasticity and multiple scattering. It examines new technologies, including atomic force acoustic microscopy, lasers, micro-acoustics, and nanotechnology. In addition, it highlights both direct and indirect applications in neighboring disciplines""--  ""Preface to the Second Edition Almost exactly ten years have passed since the submission of the manuscript for the first edition of Fundamentals and Applications of Ultrasonic Waves and it is only human to think back on that occasion. At that time I was director of an ultrasonics research group and very much in the ""thick of things"" regarding external relations and international collaborations, including active participation in the IEEE ultrasonics symposia. There were a lot of advantages: interesting colleagues to converse with, daily access to new results, both from my research group and from the current literature, continual feedback from external groups, and so on. All of this kept me fully abreast of the latest detailed developments in research areas of personal interest in ultrasonics, together with general input on what was going on in related areas. Following that period, I retired from university research to become fully involved in a spinoff company, Microbridge Technologies Inc., which had I co-founded and whose vocation was in developing microelectronic components for sensing devices. This experience gave me access to an industrial viewpoint of MEMS devices and sensor applications, as well as a different perception of the meaning of the word ""urgent."" Today the situation is very different. Following my retirement from Microbridge I have been leading a rural lifestyle far removed from both university research and industrial microelectronics. The detailed contacts are gone, but occasional discussions with ex-colleagues, and the time to reflect on more general things have provided something else, which can be described as a clearer view of the big picture""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In his groundbreaking new book, Pais chronicles the history of the physics of matter and physical forces since the discovery of x-rays. He relates not only what has happened over the last one-hundred years, but also why it happened the way it did, the experiences of the scientists involved, and how a series of seemingly bizarre or unrelated occurrences has emerged as a logical sequence of discoveries and events. Personally involved in many of the developments described, Pais provides unique insights into the world of big and small physics, revealing how the smallest distances explored between 1895 and 1983 have shrunk a hundred millionfold. Along this ""road inward,"" scientists have made advances that later generations will rank among the principal monuments of the twentieth century.  This magisterial survey explores the discoveries made on the constituents of matter, the laws that govern them, and the forces that act on them. Demonstrating the sometimes rocky road to new insights, Pais reveals that these have been times of progress and stagnation, of order and chaos, of clarity and confusion, of belief and incredulity, of the conventional and the bizarre, as well as of revolutionaries and conservatives, of science by individuals and by consortia, of little gadgets and big machines, and of modest funds and big moneys.

In addition, equations encountered are sufficiently simple to solve even in relatively complex situations that students can further develop their intution by solving problems. In learning quantum theory, however, intutions developed for the classical world fail, and the equations to be solved are sufficiently complex that they can readily be solved without a computer only for the simplest situations. This book represents an attempt to jump the hurdle to an intuitive understanding of wave mechanics by using illustrations profusely to present the time evolution and parameter dependence of wave functions in a wide variety of situations. Most of the illustrations are computer-generated solutions of the Schr dinger equation for one- and three-dimensional systems. The situations discussed range from the simple particle in a box through resonant scattering in one dimension to the hydrogen atom and Regge classification of resonant scattering. This edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded to include a discussion of spin and magnetic resonance.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Preparing for a comprehensive examination that potentially encompasses all elements of a physical therapist assistant academic program can be an overwhelming task. Students are often exhausted after completing a rigorous academic program and suddenly are faced with the daunting task of taking a comprehensive examination. Anxiety, economics, and a strong desire to practice as a physical therapist assistant only increase a candidate's sense of urgency. Often when faced with such an overwhelming task the reaction is to either procrastinate or to wander aimlessly through study sessions without direction or focus. The text PTAEXAM: the complete study guide provides candidates with a number of powerful study tools each designed to prepare candidates for the breadth and depth associated with the current National Physical Therapist Assistant Examination.

Assuming an advanced undergraduate-level understanding of calculus, this book follows a logical progression, with each concept building upon the preceding one. Beginning with a non-mathematical survey of the optical nature of a charged particle beam, the text: Discusses both geometrical and wave optics, as well as the correspondence between them Describes the two-body scattering problem, which is essential to the interaction of a fast charged particle with matter Introduces electron emission as a practical consequence of quantum mechanics Addresses the Fourier transform and the linear second-order differential equation Includes problems to amplify and fill in the theoretical details, with solutions presented separately Charged Particle Optics Theory: An Introduction makes an ideal textbook as well as a convenient reference on the theoretical origins of the optics of charged particle beams. It is intended to prepare the reader to understand the large body of published research in this mature field, with the end result translated immediately to practical application.

Quantum walks are the quantum analogue of classical random walks. It is known that quantum computers have great power for searching unsorted databases. This power extends to many kinds of searches, particularly to the problem of finding a specific location in a spatial layout, which can be modeled by a graph. The goal is to find a specific node knowing that the particle uses the edges to jump from one node to the next.""--from back cover.

But Rebecca Bradshaw doesn't feel any different when an old lover shows up severely injured at the hospital where she runs the physical therapy department. Seven years ago baseball player Jace Cooper left her without a second thought or the chance to share the life-changing secret she swore she'd keep from him forever. Now he was back, wanting both her help and a second chance. Becca hadn't changed, and she didn't believe Jace had either, but as she helped him repair his broken body and his fractured past, she would find she was wrong on both counts. The only thing that had stayed the same was the most important thing of all--and now suddenly time was running out.From the Paperback edition.

Cropper vividly portrays the life and accomplishments of such giants as Galileo and Isaac Newton, Marie Curie and Ernest Rutherford, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, right up to contemporary figures such as Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann, and Stephen Hawking. We meet scientists--all geniuses--who could be gregarious, aloof, unpretentious, friendly, dogged, imperious, generous to colleagues or contentious rivals.  As Cropper captures their personalities, he also offers vivid portraits of their great moments of discovery, their bitter feuds, their relations with family and friends, their religious beliefs and education...

In particular, geology students need to grasp the basic physics that lies behind these processes, which this book provides in plain language and simple mathematics. It also gives the reader enough background physics to allow them to make up their own minds about the validity of what they read in the scientific literature or hear. There is an emphasis on water, an essential component of geology, on which there is much published error that is indiscernible without the background provided by this book. This up-dated and revised edition of Richard Chapman's Physics for Geologists discusses a wide range of forces at work in geology against the background of Kepler's and Newton's laws; electromagnetic radiation from optics to gamma rays, atomic structure and age-dating, heat and heat flow, electricity and magnetism, stress and strain, sea waves, acoustics, and fluids and fluid flow. The book give basic definitions and dimensions and also some warnings about mis-understanding of mathematical statistics, particularly of linear regression analysis, and unenlightened computation.

Divided into three parts, the first section covers the policy context of VR in the UK, defining vocational rehabilitation, outlining the development of national standards in the sector, and looking at issues such as: the economy and worklessness, and the legal background. The second part examines models of VR practice and relevant standards. It explores the nature of developing services in the public and private sectors, with case studies from a range of disciplinary backgrounds to illustrate. The final part presents a detailed introduction to the knowledge and skills required, including consideration of the multi-disciplinary processes and stages involved, in providing a VR service. Introduction to Vocational Rehabilitation includes numerous case studies and a dedicated chapter of issues and questions to aid reflection. Comprehensive and evidence-based, this is the first multidisciplinary textbook for students and practitioners from a range of backgrounds, including occupational therapy and health, physiotherapy, human resources, nursing, social work and health psychology""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This is an indispensable guide to physics that offers readers an overview of the most popular physics topics written in an accessible, irreverent, and engaging manner while still maintaining a tone of wry skepticism. Even the novice will be able to follow along, as the topics are addressed using plain English and (almost) no equations. Veterans of popular physics will also find their nagging questions addressed, like whether the universe can expand faster than light, and for that matter, what the universe is expanding into anyway.         Gives a one-stop tour of all the big questions that capture the public imagination including string theory, quantum mechanics, parallel universes, and the beginning of time        Explains serious science in an entertaining, conversational, and easy-to-understand way         Includes dozens of delightfully groan-worthy cartoons that explain everything from special relativity to Dark Matter     Filled with fascinating information and insights, this book will both deepen and transform your understanding of the universe. --(source)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Barsoum offers introductory coverage of ceramics, their structures and properties, with a distinct emphasis on solid state physics and chemistry. Key equations are derived from first principles to ensure a thorough understanding of the concepts involved."" ""The book divides naturally into two parts. Chapters 1 to 9 consider bonding in ceramics and their resultant physical structures, and the electrical, thermal and other properties that are dependent on bonding type. The second part (chapters 11 to 16) deals with those factors that are determined by microstructure, such as fracture and fatigue, and thermal, dielectric, magnetic and optical properties. Linking the two sections is chapter 10, which describes sintering, grain growth and the development of microstructure.""

In Schrodinger's Kittens, he took readers to the eerie world of subatomic particles & waves. Now, he explores the most exciting area of research in physics today: string theory. Following a series of major breakthroughs in the 1990s, physicists are putting together a clearer picture of how subatomic particles work. By hypothesizing particles as a single loop of vibrating ""string,"" they are on the brink of discovering a way to explain all of nature's forces in a single theory. Grandly named ""superstrings,""& incorporating the ideas of ""supersymmetry,"" these models are the prime candidate for the long sought-for ""Theory of Everything."" Written in clear & accessible language. The Search for Superstrings, Symmetry, & the Theory of Everything brings to life the remarkable scientific research that is on the cusp of radically altering our conception of the universe.

The classical physics of oscillations and waves is developed at a more advanced level than has been customary for the second year, providing a basis for the quantum mechanics that follows. In this new edition the Green's function is explained, reinforcing the integration of quantum mechanics with classical physics. The text may also form the basis of an ""introduction to theoretical physics"" for physics majors. The concluding chapters give special attention to topics in current wave physics: nonlinear waves, solitons, and chaotic behavior.

As a result, thermal physics has been considerably enriched in concepts, technique and purpose, and now has a dominant role in the developments of physics, chemistry and biology. This unique book explores the meaning and application of these developments using quantum theory as the starting point. The book links thermal physics and quantum mechanics in a natural way. Concepts are combined with interesting examples, and entire chapters are dedicated to applying the principles to familiar, practical and unusual situations. Together with end-of-chapter exercises, this book gives advanced undergraduate and graduate students a modern perception and appreciation for this remarkable subject""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Scientists now view entanglement as a physical resource with many important applications. These range from quantum computers, which would be able to compute exponentially faster than classical computers, to quantum cryptographic techniques, which could provide unbreakable codes for the transfer of secret information over public channels. These important advances in the study of quantum entanglement and information touch on deep foundational issues in both physics and philosophy. This interdisciplinary volume brings together fourteen of the world's leading physicists and philosophers of physics to address the most important developments and debates in this exciting area of research. It offers a broad spectrum of approaches to resolving deep foundational challenges - philosophical, mathematical, and physical - raised by quantum information, quantum processing, and entanglement. This book is ideal for historians, philosophers of science and physicists""--Provided by publisher.  ""Entanglement can be understood as an extraordinary degree of correlation between states of quantum systems - a correlation that cannot be given an explanation in terms of something like a common cause. Entanglement can occur between two or more quantum systems, and the most interesting case is when these correlations occur between systems that are space-like separated, meaning that changes made to one system are immediately correlated with changes in a distant system even though there is no time for a signal to travel between them.1 In this case one says that quantum entanglement leads to non-local correlations, or non-locality. More precisely, entanglement can be defined in the following way""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Understanding Viscoelasticity,Nhan Phan-Thien,physics,First published in 2012,/works/OL19908610W?edition=ia%3Aunderstandingvis00phan_504,/authors/OL575864A/Nhan_Phan-Thien,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27093452M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 202","This book presents an introduction to viscoelasticity; in particular, to the theories of dilute polymer solutions and dilute suspensions of rigid particles in viscous and incompressible fluids. These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids. All the basic ideas in DPD are reviewed, with some sample problems to illustrate the methodology.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The consumption of polypropylene over the years has been relatively high, mainly due to the steady improvement of its property profile. Polypropylene: Structures, Blends and Composites, in three separate volumes, reflects on the key factors which have contributed to the success of polypropylene, dealing with all aspects of structure-performance relationships relevant to thermoplastic polymers and related composites. Volume 1, Structure and Morphology, deals with polymorphism in polypropylene homo- and copolymers, where molecular and supermolecular structures are covered, and the processing-induced structure development of polypropylene, showing the interrelation between the processing-induced morphology and mechanical performance. Volume 2, Copolymers and Blends, contains comprehensive surveys of the nucleation and crystallisation behaviour of the related systems. It includes the development of morphology and its effects on rheological and mechanical properties of polypropylene-based alloys and blends and a review of polypropylene-based thermoplastic elastomers. Volume 3, Composites, gives a comprehensive overview of filled and reinforced systems with polypropylene as a matrix material, with the main emphasis on processing-structure-property-interrelationships. Chapters cover all aspects of particulate filled, chopped fibre-, fibre mat- and continuous fibre-reinforced composites. Interfacial phenomena, such as adhesion, wetting and interfacial crystallisation, are also included as important aspects of this subject.

To investigate the secondary creep behaviour the existence of a creep potential is presumed. It is established, that regarding to the theory of representation for tensor functions the creep potential hypothesis furnishes only restricted forms of constitutive equations even if a general creep potential is assumed in the anisotropic case. The creep process in its tertiary phase is characterized by a damage tensor. Some possible representations of constitutive equations involving (initial) anisotropy of the material (e.g. from rolling) and anisotropic creep-damage are discussed. The formulation of such equations is based upon theorems regarding tensor-valued tensor functions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It focuses on the development and application of theoretical methods to help students develop their problem-solving skills. The book begins with microscopic transport processes: diffusion, collision-driven phenomena, and exclusion. It then presents the kinetics of aggregation, fragmentation and adsorption, where the basic phenomenology and solution techniques are emphasized. The following chapters cover kinetic spin systems, both from a discrete and a continuum perspective, the role of disorder in non-equilibrium processes, hysteresis from the non-equilibrium perspective, the kinetics of chemical reactions, and the properties of complex networks. The book contains 200 exercises to test students' understanding of the subject. A link to a website hosted by the authors, containing supplementary material including solutions to some of the exercises, can be found at www.cambridge.org/9780521851039""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This completely revised and updated edition, written for sufferers and practitioners alike, provides all the information you need to play an active part in your own treatment.The human spine is not well suited for our way of life and as a result back pain is pandemic - there is hardly anyone who has not been bothered by it at some time. Advanced as we are in other areas of science, with fixing backs we are little further ahead.This book breaks new ground, and is written for sufferers and practitioners alike. In layman's language it charts a new, easy-to-understand model for the way the human spine breaks down, starting off with commonplace and totally reversible conditions (which 90 per cent of us have), and progressing to the more difficult ones.The Back Sufferers' Bible describes clearly how each stage of back pain manifests, and sets out a logical course of treatment programs. It explains when you need medication and when you need to rest in bed. It explains all the exercises - how to do them and the common pitfalls with each one. It gives you all the information you need to play an active part in your own treatment. For practitioners, there is a new section of comprehensive source material and further reading.Now you can understand what has gone wrong with your spine and take steps to keep your back healthy and pain-free.ORDERSThe BackBlock and Ma Roller used in this book can be ordered direct by sending a cheque or money order (for BackBlock, plastic or wooden: $66; Ma Roller $40; for both: $95 inclusive of GST and postage and handling) to:The Sarah Key Physiotherapy Centre6th Floor, 44 Bridge StreetSYDNEY NSW 2000Inquiries email: net@sarahkey.com   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book explores the principle's origin in the atomic spectroscopy of the early 1920s, its subsequent embedding into quantum mechanics, and later experimental validation with the development of quantum chromodynamics. The reconstruction of this crucial historic episode provides an excellent foil to reconsider Kuhn's view on incommensurability. The author defends the prospective rationality of the revolutionary transition from the old to the new quantum theory around 1925 by focusing on the way Pauli's principle emerged as a phenomenological rule 'deduced' from some anomalous phenomena and theoretical assumptions of the old quantum theory. The subsequent process of validation is historically reconstructed and analysed within the framework of 'dynamic Kantianism'. The variety of themes skilfully interwoven in this book will appeal to philosophers, historians, scientists and anyone interested in philosophy.

Jet Quenching in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions at the LHC,Aaron Angerami,physics,First published in 2012,/works/OL20807604W,/authors/OL7940398A/Aaron_Angerami,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28168689M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  [publisher not identified]|Language English,"Jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is studied using Pb+Pb collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon. The measurements reported here utilize data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC from the 2010 Pb ion run corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 7 Âµ b^(-1). The results are obtained using fully reconstructed jets using the anti-k t algorithm with a per-event background subtraction procedure. A centrality-dependent modification of the dijet asymmetry distribution is observed, which indicates a higher rate of asymmetric dijet pairs in central collisions relative to periphal and pp collisions. Simultaneously the dijet angular correlations show almost no centrality dependence. These results provide the first direct observation of jet quenching. Measurements of the single inclusive jet spectrum, measured with jet radius parameters R=0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, are also presented. The spectra are unfolded to correct for the finite energy resolution introduced by both detector effects and underlying event fluctuations.  Single jet production, through the central-to-peripheral ratio R CP, is found to be suppressed in central collisions by approximately a factor of two, nearly independent of the jet p T. The R CP is found to have a small but significant increase with increasing R, which may relate directly to aspects of radiative energy loss.

From centrifugation and solvent dynamics to viscosity and diffusion, experimental measurements and their quantitative representations are the core of the discussion. The book reveals several experiments never before recognized as revealing polymer solution properties. A novel approach to relaxation phenomena accurately describes viscoelasticity and dielectric relaxation and how they depend on polymer size and concentration. Ideal for graduate students and researchers interested in the properties of polymer solutions, the book covers real measurements on practical systems, including the very latest results. Every significant experimental method is presented in considerable detail, giving unprecedented coverage of polymers in solution""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These two are interchangeable and have manifested themselves in various forms to compose all the World's visible or invisible. Although matter has dimension, shape and form, energy exists in many different forms but has no dimension or shape. The evolution of the cosmos in the 14 billion years of the cosmic year, makes us aware of the existential law that the existing balance and harmony among all the physical phenomena, from fundamental particles to the entire universe, sustain the world's stability in this extensive pathway. The law of balance and equilibrium of forces, rules over the whole world and contains the four fundamental forces of nature, namely gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces. According to this view, the physical existence of human, that is, the material body and its field body, is an obvious example of this comprehensive law. The equilibrium law encompasses all angles of life, from the microscopic world of vibrational strings, to cells and all components of the macroscopic world, and is defined as electromagnetically expanding wave. If we look at the components of the neurological system and the laws of modern physics with extensive insight, we will soon discover that organisms are part of a balanced whole and follow a constant physical law. We have called this constant law in the book ""Quantum Theory"". ...""   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Leaders in the field discuss not only the mimicking of natural structures and solutions to engineering problems, but also the true understanding of natural processes and the application of these techniques to established technologies. Suitable for researchers and graduate students, the book does more than describe how to extract good design from nature--it highlights natural design techniques in context, allowing for a more complete modeling picture""--  ""Biomimetic photonics is a fascinating research are in that scientists from different backgrounds contribute to it. And contributors to this book also raise some interesting ideas:(1)Nature does so many different things with so few building blocks, using so little energy. Randomness, fuzziness and even chaos are integral parts of how nature does things most effectively and efficiently. (2) We are the only conscious species on earth that is able to use technology to a point at which our carelessness and thoughtlessness leads to a significant global impact on the ecosystem. Still, we can learn from the design principles that are used in plants and animals to produce structures and devices that might help slowing down and even reversing anthropogenic changes in the environment. (3) Animate nature contains many yet undiscovered clues that will help scientists and engineers to solve some of the most prominent problems we face""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In jedem der sieben Kapitel werden traditionelle Aspekte berücksichtigt wie Martin Wagenscheins physikdidaktische Auffassungen. Außerdem sind auch neuere Entwicklungen der Physikdidaktik dargestellt, wie zum Beispiel Computer und Internet im Physikunterricht oder wie man den ""Lernererfolg"" messen kann. Auswahlkriterium für diese Variablen des Physikunterrichts: sie müssen sich in der Schule und/ oder in der Lehrerbildung bewährt haben. Insgesamt werden in ""Physikdidaktik"" favorisiert: offener, schülerzentrierter Unterricht gegenüber lehrerzentriertem Unterricht, Gruppenunterricht und individualisierter Unterricht gegenüber Frontalunterricht. Unverkennbar ist auch die Tendenz zu fachüberschreitendem Physikunterricht, sei es in Projekten oder durch wissenschaftstheoretische und wissenschaftsethische Reflexionen über Physik und die damit zusammenhängende Technik. ""Physikdidaktik - eine Einführung in Theorie und Praxis"" wendet sich vor allem an Studierende des Lehramts Physik, aber es können darüber hinaus die Physiklehrerinnen und Physiklehrer aller Schulstufen davon profitieren.

This book is primarily oriented towards students and young researchers who need to acquire rapidly a basic knowledge of this active and rapidly changing research field. To this aim, the presentation is focused on a selection of basic models and inspiring examples, and includes topics which emerged recently such as ion acceleration, ""relativistic engineering"" and radiation friction. The contents are presented in a self-contained way assuming only a basic knowledge of classical electrodynamics, mechanics and relativistic dynamics at the undergraduate (Bachelor) level, without requiring any previous knowledge of plasma physics. Hence, the book may serve in several ways: as a compact textbook for lecture courses, as a short and accessible introduction for the newcomer, as a quick reference for the experienced researcher, and also as an introduction to some nonlinear mathematical methods through examples of their application to laser-plasma modeling.

"The lightness of being: mass, ether, and the unification of forces",Frank Wilczek,physics,First published in 2008,/works/OL4480674W?edition=ia%3Alightnessbeingma00wilc,/authors/OL894144A/Frank_Wilczek,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23110385M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Basic Books|Language English|Pages 270,"What's the meaning of it all? Or rather: what exactly is 'it'? Here Frank Wilczek, Nobel Prize-winning physicist and legend, examines the very nature of reality itself, showing how almost everything we think we know about 'it' is wrong.The Lightness of Being is an engaging tour de force, revealing a universe where matter is the hum of strange music, mass doesn't weigh, and empty space is a multilayered, multicoloured superconductor. Physicists' understanding of the essential nature of reality changed radically over the past quarter century. And Frank Wilczek has played a lead role in establishing the new paradigms. Transcending the clash and mismatch of older ideas about what matter and space is, Wilczek presents some brilliant and clear syntheses. Extraordinarily readable and authoritative, The Lightness of Being is the first book to unwrap these exciting new ideas for the general public. It explores their implications for basic questions about space, mass, energy, and the longed-for possibility of a fully unified theory of Nature.Pointing to new directions where great discoveries in fundamental physics are likely, and providing a visionary context for the experiments in CERN, he envisions a new Golden Age in physics.

She's pretty, confident, and the owner of a thriving up-scale fitness center. But in the shadow of success, a troubled member of the club develops a strange fixation on Blair, imitating her style and dress. Matters take a darker turn when the look-alike is shot dead--and Blair witnesses the horror.  As the media speculates on the tawdry details of the homicide and pushes Blair into the harsh spotlight, she locks horns with police lieutenant Wyatt Bloodsworth. He wants to lead an investigation without interference, while Blair is determined to probe the dead woman's life on her own. But when someone begins to menace Blair with mounting threats, Wyatt takes notice: Was this murder indeed a lethal case of mistaken identity--and was Blair the intended victim?

A comparison between the theory and experiment then enables these systems to be used as quantum simulators; for example, to test various generic properties of low dimensional systems such as Luttinger liquid physics, the paradigm of one dimensional interacting quantum systems. Application of these techniques to a material made of weakly coupled ladders (BPCB) allowed the first quantitative test of Luttinger liquids. In addition, other physical quantities (magnetization, specific heat etc.), and more remarkably the spin-spin correlations – directly measurable in neutron scattering experiments – were in excellent agreement with the observed quantities. We thus now have tools to quantitatively assess the dynamics for this class of quantum systems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The popularity of using quantum trajectories as a computational tool has exploded over the last decade, finally bringing this methodology to the level of practical application. This book explores this powerful tool to efficiently solve both static and time-dependent systems across a large area of quantum mechanics. Many of the pioneers who have either developed the subject from its inception or have improved on the subject contribute to this volume. They offer their insights on Lagrangian and Eulerian methods as well as various mixed quantum-classical techniques, among other topics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In our busy lives, rest is defined as the absence of work: late-night TV binges, hours spent trawling the Internet, something to do once we've finished everything else on our to-do lists. But dismissing rest stifles our ability to think creatively and truly recharge. In Rest, Silicon Valley consultant Alex Pang argues that we can be more successful in all areas of our lives by recognizing the importance of rest: working better does not mean working more, it means working less and resting better. Treating rest as a passive activity secondary to work undermines our chances for a rewarding and meaningful life. Whether by making space for daily naps, as Winston Churchill did during World War II; going on hours-long strolls like Charles Darwin; or spending a week alone in a cabin like Bill Gates, pursuing what Pang calls ""deliberate rest"" is the true key to fulfillment and creative success. Drawing on rigorous scientific evidence and revelatory historical examples, Rest overturns everything our culture has taught us about work and shows that only by resting better can we start living better   Read more Read less",13 Want to read|1 Currently reading|4 Have read

The underlying geometrical structure is unfolded in a coordinate-free manner via the modern mathemarical notions of fibre bundles and exterior forms. Topics such as the dynamics of Yang-Mills theories, instanton solutions and topological invariants are included as applications.  By transferring these concepts to local space-time symmetries, generalizations of Einstein' theory of gravity arise in a Riemann-Cartan space with curvature and torsion. It provides the framework in which the Poincarè gauge theory, the Rainich geometrization of the Einstein-Maxwell system, and higher-dimensional, non-abelian Kaluza-Klein theories are treated.

In this book, which contains several of his key papers as well as new material, he focuses on the problem of consciousness and explains how quantum mechanics allows causally effective conscious thought to be combined in a natural way with the physical brain made of neurons and atoms. The book is divided into four sections. The first consists of an extended introduction. Key foundational and somewhat more technical papers are included in the second part, together with a clear exposition of the ""orthodox"" interpretation of quantum mechanics. The third part addresses, in a non-technical fashion, the implications of the theory for some of the most profound questions that mankind has contemplated: How does the world come to be just what it is and not something else? How should humans view themselves in a quantum universe? What will be the impact on society of the revised scientific image of the nature of man? The final part contains a mathematical appendix for the specialist and a glossary of important terms and ideas for the interested layman. This new edition has been updated and extended to address recent debates about consciousness.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why do we actually give Christmas gifts? Why has smell become an important component in the Christmas shopping experience? Roger Highfield, science editor of London's Daily Telegraph and co-author of the highly acclaimed The Arrow of Time, has taken a long-overdue look at our most cherished holiday from the rigorous (but highly entertaining) viewpoint of a scientist. What are the thermodynamics involved in cooking a turkey? What are the likely celestial candidates for the Star of Bethlehem? Is the concept of a virgin birth scientifically feasible? What happens to us physically when we overindulge in alcohol? How does snow form? Why are we always depressed after Christmas? How does Santa manage to deliver all those presents in one night? (He has, in fact, little over two ten- thousands of a second to get between each of the 842 million households he must visit.)

Instead of handling anisotropic particles of arbitrary shape, the authors consider the more amenable problem of aggregates of spherical particles. This is often found to be a very satisfactory approach as the optical response of nonspherical particles depends more on their general symmetry and the quantity of refractive material than on the precise details of their shape. The book addresses a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from scattering properties of water droplets containing pollutants, atmospheric aerosols and ice crystals to the modeling of cosmic dust grains as aggregates.

It is essential to current attempts to explain gravity and the underlying structure of the universe. The history of how such an unfathomable concept has risen to prominence takes centre stage in The Great Beyond. The story begins with Einstein's famous quarrel with Heisenberg and Bohr, whose theories of uncertainty threatened the order Einstein believed was essential to the universe, and it was his rejection of uncertainty that drove him to ponder the existence of a fifth dimension.Beginning with this famous disagreement and culminating with an explanation of the newest ""brane"" approach, author Paul Halpern shows how current debates about the nature of reality began as age-old controversies, and will address how the possibility of higher dimensions has influenced culture over the past one hundred years (visiting the work of H.G. Wells, Salvador Dali and others).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

""The book begins with a review of the standard model, followed by the basics of heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry and how it can be applied to the classification of states, decays and fragmentation. Heavy quark effective theory is then developed, including the radiative and 1/m[subscript Q] corrections, and applied to the study of hadron masses, form factors, and inclusive decay rates. The authors also discuss the application of chiral perturbation theory to heavy hadrons."".  ""Many of the key calculations are performed step by step, and problems and a concise review of the literature are provided at the end of each chapter.

Introduction to Thin Film Transistors,S.D. Brotherton,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19859267W?edition=ia%3Aintroductiontoth00brot,/authors/OL7563507A/S.D._Brotherton,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27047101M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer International Publishing,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 488","Introduction to Thin Film Transistors reviews the operation, application, and technology of the main classes of thin film transistor (TFT) of current interest for large area electronics. The TFT materials covered include hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si), transparent amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS), and organic semiconductors. The large scale manufacturing of a-Si:H TFTs forms the basis of the active matrix flat panel display industry. Poly-Si TFTs facilitate the integration of electronic circuits into portable active matrix liquid crystal displays, and are increasingly used in active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED) displays for smart phones. The recently developed AOS TFTs are seen as an alternative option to poly-Si and a-Si:H for AMOLED TV and large AMLCD TV applications, respectively. The organic TFTs are regarded as a cost effective route into flexible electronics.^  As well as treating the highly divergent preparation and properties of these materials, the physics of the devices fabricated from them is also covered, with emphasis on performance features such as carrier mobility limitations, leakage currents and instability mechanisms. The thin film transistors implemented with these materials are the conventional, insulated gate field effect transistors, and a further chapter describes a new thin film transistor structure: the source gated transistor, SGT.The driving force behind much of the development of TFTs has been their application to AMLCDs, and there is a chapter dealing with the operation of these displays, as well as of AMOLED and electrophoretic displays. A discussion of TFT and pixel layout issues is also included.For students and new-comers to the field, introductory chapters deal with basic semiconductor surface physics, and with classical MOSFET operation.^  These topics are handled analytically, so that the underlying device physics is clearly revealed. These treatments are then used as a reference point, from which the impact of additional band-gap states on TFT behaviour can be readily appreciated.This reference book, covering all the major TFT technologies, will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and engineers in the large area electronics industry. It will also be a broad introduction for research students and other scientists entering the field, as well as providing an accessible and comprehensive overview for undergraduate and postgraduate teaching programmes.

This book supersedes the author’s previous Springer book “Evaluating Feynman Integrals” and its textbook version “Feynman Integral Calculus.” Since the publication of these two books, powerful new methods have arisen and conventional methods have been improved on in essential ways. A further qualitative change is the fact that most of the methods and the corresponding algorithms have now been implemented in computer codes which are often public.In comparison to the two previous books, three new chapters have been added:  One is on sector decomposition, while the second describes a new method by Lee. The third new chapter concerns the asymptotic expansions of Feynman integrals in momenta and masses, which were described in detail in another Springer book, “Applied Asymptotic Expansions in Momenta and Masses,” by the author. This chapter describes, on the basis of papers that appeared after the publication of said book, how to algorithmically discover the regions relevant to a given limit within the strategy of expansion by regions. In addition, the chapters on the method of Mellin-Barnes representation and on the method of integration by parts have been substantially rewritten, with an emphasis on the corresponding algorithms and computer codes.

Current studies in these areas are going ahead at a full speed. Chapters included into the book present an overview on major recent achievements. They cover a number of different physical settings, which are introduced when a nonlinearity is added to underlying symmetric configurations. The spontaneous symmetry breaking, alias self-trapping into asymmetric states, happens when the strength of the nonlinearity exceeds a certain critical value. A related generic dynamical effect appears in the form of Josephson oscillations between mutually symmetric states. Theoretical studies of these phenomena, as well as related experimental findings, are extensively discussed in the book - chiefly, in the context of Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear optics.

This book presents a thorough, step-by-step introduction to solar and stellar dynamos. Looking first at the ultimate origin of cosmic seed magnetic fields, the antagonists of field amplification are next considered: resistive decay, flux expulsion, and flows ruled out by anti-dynamo theorems. Two kinematic flows that can act as dynamos are then studied: the Roberts cell and the CP-flow. Mean-field electrodynamics and derivation of the mean-field dynamo equations lead to the alpha Omega-dynamo, the flux transport dynamo, and dynamos based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism. Alternatives to the mean-field theory are also presented, as are global MHD dynamo simulations. Fluctuations and grand minima in the solar cycle are discussed in terms of dynamo modulations through stochastic forcing and nonlinear effects. The book concludes with an overview of the major challenges in understanding stellar magnetic fields and their evolution in terms of various dynamo models, global MHD simulations, and fossil fields. Each chapter is accompanied by an annotated bibliography, guiding the readers to the relevant technical literature, which may lead them to carry out their own research in the field of dynamo theory.

These two paradigms have their counterparts in another emerging subject of wave motion: Acoustic metamaterials, which are locally resonant structures displaying an effective macroscopic behaviour (such as a negative density) beyond Newton's second law. Applications of acoustic metamaterials range from non-invasive probing and high-resolution tomography in medical imaging, to acoustic camouflaging and seismic protection.The twelve chapters constituting this book present an up-to-date survey of many aspects of acoustic metamaterials, including filtering effects, extraordinary transmission, subwavelength imaging via tomography or time-reversal techniques, cloaking via transformation acoustics and elastodynamics and even cloaking via acoustic scattering cancellation and active exterior cloaking.  It is hoped that the variety of subjects touched upon in this book, and the ways in which they can be treated theoretically, numerically and experimentally give a grasp of the richness of the emerging topic of acoustic metamaterials and will contribute to initiate even more research activity and applications in the near future.The book will be a valuable reference for postgraduate students, lecturers and researchers working on acoustic metamaterials and the wider field of wave phenomena.

A straightforward semiclassical approach is introduced to yield a remarkably detailed insight into the lateral distributions of diffuse scatterers such as adsorbates, vacancies and atomic steps. The recent discovery that the long range Van der Waals force is the cause of the unusually large cross-sections for diffuse He-scattering on individual defects and impurities led the authors to propose a new methods of surface analysis. They introduce a semiclassical method, the overlap approach, to give a simple and detailed description of He-scattering from disordered surfaces. The method yields subtle, otherwise hardly obtainable information on the nature of interactions between diffuse scatterers. The authors address such questions as the lateral distribution of adsorbates, two-dimensional phase transitions, surface diffusions, and the morphology of growing or sputtered layers.

This textbook conveys the basic elements of the Standard Model using elementary concepts, without the theoretical rigor found in most other texts on this subject. It contains examples of basic experiments, allowing readers to see how measurements and theory interplay in the development of physics. The author examines leptons, hadrons and quarks, before presenting the dynamics and the surprising properties of the charges of the different forces. The textbook concludes with a brief discussion on the recent discoveries of physics beyond the Standard Model, and its connections with cosmology. Quantitative examples are given, and the reader is guided through the necessary calculations. Each chapter ends in the exercises, and solutions to some problems are included in the book. Complete solutions are available to instructors at www.cambridge.org/9780521880213. This textbook is suitable for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students.

Polymer Composite Materials - Interface Phenomena & Processes,Y.

Polymer composites, with their wide range of possible fillers and polymers, open the way to an enormous range of materials with differing chemical, physical, and mechanical properties. The ultimate goal of polymer composite research is to formulate procedures that will lead to the design of composites with preset, i.e. specified, properties. Based on many years' experience in the field, the authors prepare the way towards just such a design procedure. The key element is the analysis and classification of the state of the filler-polymer interfaces from the point of view of their acid-base adsorption interactions. These interfacial phenomena play a pivotal role in determining overall properties of the composite: its rheological behaviour, its structural properties, catalytic effects in polymerization and polycondensation, and other technological characteristics. The book discusses and evaluates the extensive previous research scattered throughout the literature in Eastern Europe and the West, presents numerous experimental studies, and sets new benchmarks for the analysis of polymer composites. The book is required for researchers wanting to keep abreast of the progress in the burgeoning fields of polymer analysis and design.

These effects certainly have to be taken into account and may even be exploited when developing more and more miniaturized electronic circuits. This book introduces very recent results of active research on such phenomena with an emphasis on single-electron tunneling (SET). Besides a balanced presentation of theoretical aspects and experimental results of single-electron tunneling intunnel junctions, junction arrays, and one-and two-dimensional electron gas systems, a rich collection of other quantum effects in mesoscopic devices and phenomena in semi-/ superconducting junctions are treated in detail.

This is an indispensable guide to physics that offers readers an overview of the most popular physics topics written in an accessible, irreverent, and engaging manner while still maintaining a tone of wry skepticism. Even the novice will be able to follow along, as the topics are addressed using plain English and (almost) no equations. Veterans of popular physics will also find their nagging questions addressed, like whether the universe can expand faster than light, and for that matter, what the universe is expanding into anyway.    Gives a one-stop tour of all the big questions that capture the public imagination including string theory, quantum mechanics, parallel universes, and the beginning of time  Explains serious science in an entertaining, conversational, and easy-to-understand way  Includes dozens of delightfully groan-worthy cartoons that explain everything from special relativity to Dark Matter      Filled with fascinating information and insights, this book will both deepen and transform your understanding of the universe.

High Sensitivity Moiré,Daniel Post,physics,First published in 1997,/works/OL19855396W?edition=ia%3Ahighsensitivitym00post,/authors/OL717855A/Daniel_Post,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7449607M-M.jpg,"Publish Date April 24, 1997|Publisher  Springer|Language English|Pages 444","This book describes both the theory and practice of physical measurements that use high-sensitivity moire - principally moire interferometry. Its focus is on the mechanics and micromechanics of materials and structural elements. Unlike both classical and holographic interferometry, which are best suited for out-of-plane deformation measurements, moire interferometry provides whole-field maps of the in-plane displacements. Normal strains and shear strains are derived directly from the in-plane data. Moire with 2400 lines per mm is typical in practice, yielding a sensitivity of 2.4 moire fringes per micron of displacement. For micromechanics, sensitivity corresponding to 17 nm per fringe contour is demonstrated. Part II is devoted to applications of moire interferometry and microscopic moire interferometry. New studies, not previously published, are included. Diverse fields are addressed: advanced composite materials, thermal stresses, electronic packaging, fracture, metallurgy, time-dependence, strain gage calibration. The methods can be applied for whole-field measurements on nearly and solid body. This reader-friendly book should serve engineers and scientists who are concerned with measurements of real phenomena - and it should stimulate students to pursue the treasures of experimental analysis.

In this monograph the author treats various macroscopic equations, in particular the Boltzmann equation for a low density fluid of hard spheres and the nonlinear diffusion equation for stochastic lattice gases. Also discussed are Gaussian fluctuations around the large scale deterministic motion, and the dynamics of tracer particles. The book addresses both researchers and students.

Nonlinearities and Synchronization in Musical Acoustics and Music Psychology,Rolf Bader,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19891073W?edition=ia%3Anonlinearitiessy00bade,/authors/OL861275A/Rolf_Bader,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27077590M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 517","Nonlinearities are a crucial and founding principle in nearly all musical systems, may they be musical instruments, timbre or rhythm perception and production, or neural networks of music perception. This volume gives an overview about present and past research in these fields. In Musical Acoustics, on the one hand the nonlinearities in musical instruments often produce the musically interesting features. On the other, musical instruments are nonlinear by nature, and tone production is the result of synchronization and self-organization within the instruments. Furthermore, as nearly all musical instruments are driven by impulses an Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) is suggested, an iterative framework holding for all musical instruments. It appears that this framework is able to reproduce the complex and perceptionally most salient initial transients of musical instruments. In Music Psychology, nonlinearities are present in all areas of musical features, like pitch, timbre, or rhythm perception. In terms of rhythm production and motion, self-organizing models are the only ones able to explain sudden phase-transitions while tapping. Self-organizing neural nets, both of the Kohonen and the connectionist types are able to reproduce tonality, timbre similarities, or phrases. The volume also gives an overview about the signal processing tools suitable to analyze sounds in a nonlinear way, both in the Fourier-domain, like Wavelets or correlograms, and in the phase-space domain, like fractal dimensions or information structures. Furthermore, it gives an introduction to Physical Modeling of musical instruments using Finite-Element and Finite-Difference methods, to cope with the high complexity of instrument bodies and wave couplings. It appears, that most musical systems are self-organized ones, and only therefore able to produce all unexpected and interesting features of music, both in production and perception.

Sustainable Land Management in a European Context,Thomas Weith,physics,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501592W,/authors/OL6749728A/Thomas_Weith,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2021|Publisher  Springer Nature|Pages 347,"This open access book presents and discusses current issues and innovative solution approaches for land management in a European context. Manifold sustainability issues are closely interconnected with land use practices. Throughout the world, we face increasing conflict over the use of land as well as competition for land. Drawing on experience in sustainable land management gained from seven years of the FONA programme (Research for Sustainable Development, conducted under the auspices of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research), the book stresses and highlights co-design processes within the “co-creation of knowledge”, involving collaboration in transdisciplinary research processes between academia and other stakeholders. The book begins with an overview of the current state of land use practices and the subsequent need to manage land resources more sustainably. New system solutions and governance approaches in sustainable land management are presented from a European perspective on land use. The volume also addresses how to use new modes of knowledge transfer between science and practice. New perspectives in sustainable land management and methods of combining knowledge and action are presented to a broad readership in land system sciences and environmental sciences, social sciences and geosciences.

Recounting the pivotal moments that helped launch Zukerman as the breakout star of the boutique fitness world, Riding High is a reminder that the greatest success stories often start in the unlikeliest of places. Ruth Zukerman used her heartache-at the death of her father, the end of her marriage, and the dissolution of her first business partnership with SoulCycle, as the inspiration to reinvent herself. At 51, she founded a new business, the highly successful Flywheel, and built the life she'd always dreamed of. And she did it all while navigating through single motherhood and a business world that is often unkind to women, especially those who wear their hearts on their sleeves. Riding High is a prescriptive, warts-and-all journey through Ruth's evolution, offering fresh, unexpected business and life lessons to help readers recognize their own potential and channel their passion into success.

In natural outdoor conditions, the experimental study of natural fires at real scale needs the development of an original metrology, one able to capture the large range of time and length scales involved in its dynamic nature and also able to resist the thermal, mechanical and chemical aggression of flames on devices. Robust, accurate and poorly intrusive tools must be carefully set-up and used for gaining very fluctuating data over long periods. These signals also need the development of original post-processing tools that take into account the non-steady nature of their stochastic components. Metrology for Fire Experiments in Outdoor Conditions closely analyzes these features, and also describes measurements techniques, the thermal insulation of fragile electronic systems, data acquisition, measurement errors and optimal post-processing algorithms. This book is intended for practitioners as a reference guide for optimizing measurements techniques in an outdoor environment. Advanced-level students and researchers will also find the book invaluable.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The theoretical and computational tools that enable the formulation, solution, and interpretation of nonlinear structures are presented in a systematic fashion so as to gradually attain an increasing level of complexity of structural behaviors, under the prevailing assumptions on the geometry of deformation, the constitutive aspects and the loading scenarios. Readers will find a treatment of the foundations of nonlinear structural mechanics towards advanced reduced models, unified with modern computational tools in the framework of the prominent nonlinear structural dynamic phenomena while tackling both the mathematical and applied sciences. Nonlinear Structural Mechanics: Theory, Dynamical Phenomena and Modeling is an excellent reference for engineers of various disciplines, students, and researchers involved with nonlinear structural mechanics and dynamics.

Nucleation Theory,V.I.

It also illustrates the application of these various approaches to experimentally relevant problems.                                        In spite of familiarity with the involved phenomena, it is still not possible to accurately calculate nucleation rate, as the properties of the daughter phase are insufficiently known. Existing theories based upon the classical nucleation theory have on the whole explained the trends in behavior correctly. However, they often fail spectacularly to account for new data, in particular in the case of binary or, more generally, multi-component nucleation. This book challenges such classical models and provides a more satisfactory description by using density functional theory and microscopic computer simulations to describe the properties of small clusters. Also, semi-phenomenological models are proposed that relate the properties of small clusters to known properties of the bulk phases.  This monograph is an introduction as well as a compendium to researchers in the areas of  soft condensed matter physics, chemical physics, graduate and post-graduate students in physics and chemistry starting on research in the area of nucleation, and to experimentalists wishing to gain a better understanding of the recent developments being made to account for their data.

Eberhard gives an introductory account of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and Bell's celebrated inequalities. D'Espagnat discusses realism andseparability and concludes that contemporary physics does not lead to a definite conception of the world. Eberhard shows how a model consistent with Bell's theorem can be constructed by ad- mitting faster-than-light action at a distance. Schommers discusses the structure ofspace-time and argues that physi- cally real processes do not take place in but are projected on space-time. Selleri discusses the idea that objectively real quantum waves exist and could in principle be detected.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Among the topics covered are spontaneous symmetry breaking, grand unified theories, supersymmetry, and supergravity. The book starts with a quick review of elementary particle theory and continues with a discussion of composite quarks, leptons, Higgs bosons, and CP violation; it concludes with consideration of supersymmetric unification schemes, in which bosons and leptons are considered in some sense equivalent. The second edition is updated and corrected and contains new chapters on recent developments. From reviews of the first edition: ""This book captures the exciting developments of grand unification and supersymmetry of fundamental interactions in quantum field theory... gives a self-contained field-theoretic treatment of the complete subject... almost every possible development is included here."" #Mathematical Reviews#1.

A novel feature of this book is its comprehensive description of the various concepts and formulas widely used in fusion theory based on the fundamental equations of the plasma fluid. The physics of fusion plasmas is explained mainly in relation to recent progress in tokamak research, but other plasma confinement schemes, such as stellarators and inertial confinement, are also described. The unique and systematic presentation will help readers to understand the overall structure of plasma theory and will facilitate access to more advanced literature on special topics.

All mathematical and physical quantities can be calculated explicitly which makes this field of research important also for more complicated and realistic models in quantum mechanics. The detailed results allow their implementation in numerical codes to analyse properties of alloys, impurities, crystals and other features in solid state quantum physics. This monograph presents in a systematic way the mathematical approach and unifies results obtained in recent years. The student with a sound background in mathematics will get a deeper understanding of Schrödinger Operators and will see many examples which may eventually be used with profit in courses on quantum mechanics and solid state physics. The book has textbook potential in mathematical physics and is suitable for additional reading in various fields of theoretical quantum physics.

Lane, The Bodley Head|Language English|Pages 214","A fascinating collection of Einstein’s observations about life, religion, nationalism, and a host of personal topics that engaged the genius’s intellect  In the aftermath of the First World War, Albert Einstein writes about his hopes for the League of Nations, his feelings as a German citizen about the growing anti-Semitism and nationalism of his country, and his myriad opinions about the current affairs of his day. In addition to these political perspectives, The World As I See It reveals the idealistic, spiritual, and witty side of this great intellectual as he approaches topics including “Good and Evil,” “Religion and Science,” “Active Pacifism,” “Christianity and Judaism,” and “Minorities.”  Including letters, speeches, articles, and essays written before 1935, this collection offers a complete portrait of Einstein as a humanitarian and as a human being trying to make sense of the changing world around him.  This authorized Philosophical Library ebook features a new introduction by Neil Berger, PhD, and an illustrated biography of Albert Einstein, which includes rare photos and never-before-seen documents from the Albert Einstein Archives at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Classical philosophical laws are analyzed, new assertions are formulated, laying claim to the position of laws. Syncretic logic is used for constructing the axiomatic theory of carriers and the analysis of its consequences.  The problem of the origins of life is considered, the connection between the course of existence and the laws of conservation in physics is expounded upon, the universal scheme of logical operations is described, the components of the structure of a world view are specified.

Now we have a rich variety of attractive advanced materials. They are applied to optical and electrical devices that support the information communication technology in the mid 21-th century. Accordingly, it is quite important to have a broad knowledge of the optical properties of advanced materials for students, scientists and engineers working in optics and related fields. This book is designed to teach fundamental optical properties of such advanced materials effectively. These materials have their own peculiarities which are very interesting in modern optical physics and also for applications because the concepts of optical properties are quite different from those in conventional optical materials. Hence each chapter starts to review the basic concepts of the materials briefly and proceeds to the practical use. The important topics covered in this book include:  quantum structures of semiconductors, spintronics,  photonic crystals, surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures, photonic metamaterials, liquid crystal materials, organic LED materials and magnet-optics.

The weird and wonderful world of the Buffyverse—where the melding of magic and science is an everyday occurrence—provides a fantastical jumping-off point for looking at complex theories of biology, chemistry, and theoretical physics. From surreal vampires, demons, and interdimensional portals to energy conservation, black holes, and string theory, The Physics of the Buffyverse is serious (and palatable) science for the rest of us.

Perhaps nothing reflects the breadth and scope of his brilliance, his interests, and his influence better than his publications - more than six hundred scientific papers, books, essays, reviews, and opinion pieces. His published work ranged widely over relativity theory and quantum physics, nationalism, Judaism, war, peace, and education. Indeed, Einstein's literary output was so abundant that even many of his most informed admirers are not familiar with all of it."" ""The Einstein Almanac takes a look at Einstein's year-by-year output, explaining his three hundred most important publications and setting them into the context of his life, science, and world history. Concentrating primarily on Einstein's scientific and humanitarian writings, Alice Calaprice summarizes most of the papers and describes meaningful events surrounding their publication, including Einstein's personal life, his travels, the work of other scientists, social and cultural developments at he time, and national and international events.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Recent Monte Carlo simulations on the Kern and Frenkel model of the Janus fluid have revealed that in the vapor phase, below the critical point, there is the formation of preferred inert clusters made up of a well-defined number of particles: the micelles and the vesicles. This is responsible for a re-entrant gas branch of the gas-liquid binodal. Detailed account of this findings are given in the first chapter where the Janus fluid is introduced as a product of new sophisticated synthesis laboratory techniques. In the second chapter a cluster theory is developed to approximate the exact clustering properties stemming from the simulations. It is shown that the theory is able to reproduce semi-quantitatively the micellization phenomenon.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We control emotions and control their expression. We welcome noble thoughts or noble feelings, and that which we welcome we become.This book shows the smile, laughter, the taking of breath and the simple stretch as most important exercises which are to be regularly taken. It also implies a deeper study into human co-ordinations; it tries to show a universal necessity of rhythm and is an endeavor to establish the higher principles of training in a way that makes them applicable to the most simple of human actions.The student is requested to study himself, to make a demonstration of every claim and of more than is claimed. The exercises are so simple that anyone can try and prove them, only let the trial be one continued long enough to be a real test.The moment you awake center attention upon a pleasant thought or take an attitude of joy, thanksgiving and love for all the world. Have courage and confidence that all evils will vanish; express some normal feelings at once by the expansion of the chest, a deep full breath, an inward laugh or chuckle and an increased harmonious stretch of the whole body.Everyone will be tempted to say that he cannot control his thoughts. He may say he does not wish to be a hypocrite and try to excuse himself for brooding over gloomy thoughts or the fear that he will not get through the day. Such lack of courage, lack of faith, lack of thanks for the beauties of life are sins which cannot be too strongly condemned.We can and must at once put ourselves in a positive attitude of mind. We must begin our day with a song, with a smile. We must look upward, not downward. We must reject every discordant thought and accept accordant ones regarding the coming day. It is a new day which brings new life, new joys, new duties, it may be new trials, but these, instead of being accepted as obstacles, may be turned into opportunities.

Over the past decade mechanical oscillators have emerged as a leading system of choice for many such experiments. The work reported in this thesis investigates the effects of the radiation-pressure force of light on macroscopic mechanical structures. The basic system studied is a mechanical oscillator that is highly reflective and part of an optical resonator. It interacts with the optical cavity mode via the radiation-pressure force. Both the dynamics of the mechanical oscillation and the properties of the light field are modified through this interaction. The experiments use quantum optical tools (such as homodyning and down-conversion) with the goal of ultimately showing quantum behavior of the mechanical center of mass motion. Of particular value are the detailed descriptions of several novel experiments that pave the way towards this goal and are already shaping the field of quantum optomechanics, in particular optomechanical laser cooling and strong optomechanical coupling.

Advances in the Theory and Applications of Non-integer Order Systems,Wojciech Mitkowski,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL19824836W?edition=ia%3Aadvancestheoryap00kacz,/authors/OL7307162A/Wojciech_Mitkowski,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27015333M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Springer International Publishing,              Imprint: Springer|Language English|Pages 325","This volume presents various aspects of non-integer order systems, also known as fractional systems, which have recently attracted an increasing attention in the scientific community of systems science, applied mathematics, control theory. Non-integer systems have become relevant for many fields of science and technology exemplified by the modeling of signal transmission, electric noise, dielectric polarization, heat transfer, electrochemical reactions, thermal processes,  acoustics, etc. The content is divided into six parts, every of which considers one of the currently relevant problems. In the first part the Realization problem is discussed, with a special focus on positive systems. The second part considers stability of certain classes of non-integer order systems with and without delays. The third part is focused on such important aspects as controllability, observability and optimization especially in discrete time. The fourth part is focused on distributed systems where non-integer calculus leads to new and interesting results. The next part considers problems of solutions and approximations of non-integer order equations and systems. The final and most extensive part is devoted to applications. Problems from mechatronics, biomedical engineering, robotics and others are all analyzed and solved with tools from fractional systems. This volume came to fruition thanks to high level of talks and interesting discussions at RRNR 2013 - 5th Conference on Non-integer Order Calculus and its Applications that took place at AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków, Poland, which was organized by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering.

The goal is to create a common ground for those individuals and groups involved in every aspect of remote sensing, representing a wide range of science, engineering, and management disciplines. Despite their varying viewpoints and jargons, these scientist, engineers, and mission administrators nevertheless share the common goal of bringing remote sensing instruments, missions, and programs to fruition. The fostering of great understanding and appreciation of essential aspects of remote sensing brought to the table from each discipline will generate improved communication and working relationships to facilitate succesful future exploration. Introductory chapters describe preliminary planning and support systems as well as general principles of remote sensing and electromagnetic energy interactions. The body of the book covers energy generation, instrumentation, measurements, and their interpretation for major divisions of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the visible and circumvisible, ray, and long wave regions. Processing and fusion of remote sensing data in its many forms, as well as emerging technologies for data processing and delivery, are discussed in the final chapters.--Publisher's description.

It covers:    Measurements, units, and significant figures  Forces such as displacement, speed, and acceleration  Vectors and physics notation  Motion, energy, and waves (sound, light, wave-particle)  Solids, liquids, and gases  Thermodynamics  Electromagnetism  Relativity  Atomic and nuclear structures     Steven Holzner, Ph.D. earned his B.S. at MIT and his Ph.D. at Cornell, where he taught Physics 101 and 102 for over 10 years. He livens things up with cool physics facts, real-world examples, and simple experiments that will heighten your enthusiasm for physics and science. The book ends with some out-of-this world physics that will set your mind in motion:    The possibility of wormholes in space  The Big Bang  How the gravitational pull of black holes is too strong for even light to escape     May the Force be with you!

Despite many claims that silicon technology has reached fundamental limits, the performance of silicon microelectronics continues to improve steadily. The same holds for almost all the applications for which Si was considered to be unsuitable. The main exception to this positive trend is the silicon laser, which has not been demonstrated to date. The main reason for this comes from a fundamental limitation related to the indirect nature of the Si band-gap. In the recent past, many different approaches have been taken to achieve this goal: dislocated silicon, extremely pure silicon, silicon nanocrystals, porous silicon, Er doped Si-Ge, SiGe alloys and multiquantum wells, SiGe quantum dots, SiGe quantum cascade structures, shallow impurity centers in silicon and Er doped silicon.

Like the best detective stories, it presents clues and encourages the reader to draw conclusions before the answers are revealed. The first seven chapters describe how light behaves, develop Newton's particle theory, introduce waves and an electromagnetic wave theory of light, discover the photon, and culminate in the wave-particle duality. The book then goes on to develop the special theory of relativity, showing how time dilation and length contraction are consequences of the two simple principles on which the theory is founded. An extensive chapter derives the equation E = mc2 clearly from first principles and then explores its consequences and the misconceptions surrounding it. That most famous of issues arising from special relativity - the aging of the twins - is treated simply but compellingly. Publisher's description.

But what is the Higgs boson and why is it often referred to as the God Particle? Why are the Higgs and the LHC so important? Getting a handle on the science behind the LHC can be difficult for anyone without an advanced degree in particle physics, but you don't need to go back to school to learn about it. In Collider, award-winning physicist Paul Halpern provides you with the tools you need to understand what the LHC is and what it hopes to discover.     Comprehensive, accessible guide to the theory, history, and science behind experimental high-energy physics  Explains why particle physics could well be on the verge of some of its greatest breakthroughs, changing what we think we know about quarks, string theory, dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamentals of modern physics  Tells you why the theoretical Higgs boson is often referred to as the God particle and how its discovery could change our understanding of the universe  Clearly explains why fears that the LHC could create a miniature black hole that could swallow up the Earth amount to a tempest in a very tiny teapot  ""Best of 2009 Sci-Tech Books (Physics)""-Library Journal   ""Halpern makes the search for mysterious particles pertinent and exciting by explaining clearly what we don't know about the universe, and offering a hopeful outlook for future research.""-Publishers Weekly  Includes a new author preface, ""The Fate of the Large Hadron Collider and the Future of High-Energy Physics""    The world will not come to an end any time soon, but we may learn a lot more about it in the blink of an eye.

There is every indication that this trend will accelerate and that progress in many areas will increasingly depend on the development of new materials and processing techniques. A second and equally significant trend is the continuing ascent of the information technologies, which now touch almost every aspect of life in some way. In this environment it is natural that there is a strong interest in using numerical modeling in materials science. With its extreme accuracy and reasonable computational efficiency, the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method has emerged as the standard by which density functional calculations for transition metal and rare-earth containing materials are judged. Planewaves, Pseudopotentials and the LAPW Method presents a thorough and self-contained exposition of the LAPW method, making this powerful technique more accessible to researchers and students who have some familiarity with local density approximation calculations. Theory is discussed, but the emphasis is on how practical implementation proceeds. In addition, the author suggests future directions for adapting the LAPW method to simulations of complex materials requiring large unit cells. He does this by elucidating the connections between the LAPW method and planewave pseudopotential approaches and by showing how Car--Parrinello type algorithms can be adapted to the LAPW method. Planewaves, Pseudopotentials and the LAPW Method is a valuable resource for researchers already involved in electronic structure calculations, as well as for newcomers seeking quick mastery of the LAPW technique.

Wiley|Language English,"Advance Praise for Gravity's Arc      ""A beautifully written exposition of the still mysterious force that holds our universe together--and the even more mysterious dark twin that may blow it apart.""  --Joshua Gilder, coauthor of Heavenly Intrigue    ""A lucid book as up-to-date as the effect of gravity on the bones of astronauts.""  --Denis Brian, author of The Unexpected Einstein    How did they do it?    How did one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived retard the study of gravity for 2,000 years? How did a gluttonous tyrant with a gold nose revolutionize our view of the solar system? How could an eccentric professor shake the foundations of an entire belief system by dropping two objects from a tower? How did a falling apple turn the thoughts of a reclusive genius toward the moon? And how could a simple patent clerk change our entire view of the universe by imagining himself riding on a beam of light?    In Gravity's Arc, you'll discover how some of the most colorful, eccentric, and brilliant people in history first locked, then unlocked the door to understanding one of nature's most essential forces. You'll find out why Aristotle's misguided conclusions about gravity became an unassailable part of Christian dogma, how Galileo slowed down time to determine how fast objects fall, and why Isaac Newton erased every mention of one man's name from his magnum opus Principia. You'll also figure out what Einstein meant when he insisted that space is curved, whether there is really such a thing as antigravity, and why some scientists think that the best way to get to outer space is by taking an elevator.

This thesis reports a detailed study of the molecular response of a large variety of push-pull organic compounds using the Second Harmonic Generation technique, which will serve as a starting point for the investigation at the macroscopic scale of azobenzene-based liquid crystalline polymeric films and their blends with highly efficient NLO chromophores. These materials are designed with the aim of exploiting their photo-addressability in order to tailor their nonlinear behaviour. The magnitude and symmetry of their nonlinear response was successfully controlled via light irradiation and thermal treatments.

The first is the time-domain picture, in which the beam is rapidly sampled at a high rate and a statistical analysis is used to describe the cooling behaviour. The second is the frequency-domain picture, which is particularly useful since the observations made on the beam and the numerical cooling simulations are mainly in this domain. This second picture is developed in detail to assess key components of modern cooling theory like mixing and signal shielding and to illustrate some of the diagnostic methods. Finally the use of a distribution function and the Fokker-Plank equation, which offer the most complete description of the beam during the cooling, are discussed.

There are many examples in nature of surfaces that have a well-controlled topography to affect their function. Examples include the hydrophobic effect of the lotus leaf, the reduction of fluid drag due to the riblet structure of shark skin, the directional adhesion of the gecko foot and the angular sensitivity of the multi-faceted fly eye. Surface structuring is also being used extensively in modern manufacturing. In this way many properties can be altered, for example optical, tribological, biological and fluidic. Previously, single line (profile) measurements were adequate to control manufacture of surfaces, but as the need to control the functionality of surfaces increases, there is a growing need for three-dimensional (areal) measurement and characterisation techniques. For this reason there has been considerable research, development and standardisation of areal techniques.^  This book will present the areal framework that is being adopted by the international community. Whereas previous books have concentrated on the measurement aspects, this book  concentrates on the characterisation techniques, i.e. how to interpret the measurement data to give the appropriate (functional) information for a given task.^  The first part of the book presents the characterisation methods and the second part case studies that highlight the use of areal methods in a broad range of subject areas - from automobile manufacture to archaeology.ContentsIntroduction to Surface TopographyThe Areal Field ParametersThe Areal Feature ParametersAreal Filtering MethodsAreal Form RemovalAreal Fractal MethodsChoosing the Appropriate ParameterCharacterisation of Individual Areal FeaturesMulti-Scale Signature of Surface TopographyCorrelation of Areal Surface Texture Parameters to Solar Cell EfficiencyCharacterisation of Cylinder Liner Honing Textures for Production ControlCharacterisation of the Mechanical Bond Strength for Copper on Glass Plating ApplicationsInspection of Laser Structured Cams and ConrodsRoad Surfaces   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Unlike them, however, she was more interested in stones than bones. Though she was the discoverer of Zinjanthropus, one of the most important of the early hominid skulls; thousands of other fossilized hominid bones; and the little hominid footprints at Laetoli, more than three million years old, she was looking for artifacts when she found them. She believed that it was man's early tools and the insights they gave about early man that were the keys to understanding what man was like at various stages of evolution. While Louis was looking for bones, Mary was often tracing and recording the art of the rock shelters she discovered or looking for handaxes.  The daughter of a well-known artist who had an interest in archaeology, she was also a descendant of John Frere, an 18th century British archaeologist, who reported on extinct animals sixty years before Darwin published his theory of evolution. Though she had only two or three years of traditional schooling, she traveled through Europe with her parents, crawling through pre-historic caves in France; collecting flint tools, end scrapers, and bone points among the spoil heaps of Peyrony's excavations in France; and eventually working on excavations in England herself. It was her artistic talent which brought her to the attention of well-known archaeologists, including Louis Leakey, who needed someone with background in archaeological excavation who could also illustrate.  She candidly shares the personal details of their relationship throughout the nearly forty years of their marriage, during which time they raised three sons, all of them eventually making discoveries of the own, with Richard making more discoveries than both of his parents combined. Generous in crediting other researchers for their contributions, and genuinely curious and hard-working, Mary betrays none of the ego and competitive sense here which seem to dominate this research field. In fact, it is only when Donald Johanson, working in Ethiopia, uses her discovery of a jawbone 1000 miles away to draw what she considers erroneous conclusions about his much more complete (and quite different) Lucy skeleton that we see her ferocious temper, not out of jealousy but because she believed his book to be ""lightweight,"" inaccurate, and misleading in its conclusions. Her own autobiography, by contrast, is always painfully honest, carefully considered, and modest in its assessment of her own contributions, a fascinating story of a woman who marched to her own drumbeat.

Due to the polarization of ions in a crystal that has non-central symmetry in materials, such as the wurtzite structured ZnO, GaN and InN, a piezoelectric potential (piezopotential) is created in the crystal by applying a stress. Owing to the simultaneous possession of piezoelectricity and semiconductor properties, the piezopotential created in the crystal has a strong effect on the carrier transport at the interface/junction. Piezotronics is for devices fabricated using the piezopotential as a “gate” voltage to control charge carrier transport at a contact or junction. The piezo-phototronic effect uses the piezopotential to control the carrier generation, transport, separation and/or recombination for improving the performance of optoelectronic devices, such as photon detector, solar cell and LED. The functionality offered by piezotroics and piezo-phototronics are complimentary to CMOS technology. There is an effective integration of piezotronic and piezo-phototronic devices with silicon based CMOS technology. Unique applications can be found in areas such as human-computer interfacing, sensing and actuating in nanorobotics, smart and personalized electronic signatures, smart MEMS/NEMS, nanorobotics and energy sciences. This book introduces the fundamentals of piezotronics and piezo-phototronics and advanced applications. It gives guidance to researchers, engineers and graduate students.

This graduate textbook describes the main theoretical approaches and computational techniques, from the simplest approximations to the most sophisticated methods. It starts with a detailed description of the various theoretical approaches to calculating the electronic structure of solids and molecules, including density-functional theory and chemical methods based on Hartree-Fock theory. The basic approximations are thoroughly discussed, and an in-depth overview of recent advances and alternative approaches in DFT is given. The second part discusses the different practical methods used to solve the electronic structure problem computationally, for both DFT and Hartree-Fock approaches. Adopting a unique and open approach, this textbook is aimed at graduate students in physics and chemistry, and is intended to improve communication between these communities. It also serves as a reference for researchers entering the field.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Inventing atmospheric science,James Rodger Fleming,physics,First published in 2016,/works/OL20030975W,/authors/OL391620A/James_Rodger_Fleming,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 296,"""This big picture history of atmospheric research examines the first six decades of the twentieth century, from the dawn of applied fluid dynamics to the emergence, by 1960, of the interdisciplinary atmospheric sciences. Using newly available archival sources, it documents the work of three interconnected generations of scientists: Vilhelm Bjerknes, Carl-Gustaf Rossby, and Harry Wexler, whose aspirations were fueled by new theoretical insights, pressing societal needs, and expanded technological capabilities. Radio, radar, aviation, nuclear tracers, digital computing, sounding rockets, and satellites provided new ways to measure and study the global atmosphere -- a huge and dauntingly complex system. Bjerknes brought us a fundamental circulation theorem and founded the Bergen school of weather forecasting; Rossby established the graduate schools of meteorology at M.I.T., Chicago, and Stockholm, which focused on upper-air dynamics and, after 1947, on atmospheric environmental issues; and Wexler brought all the new technologies into the U.S. Weather Bureau and, with his colleague Jule Charney, prepared the foundations for the emergence of the interdisciplinary atmospheric sciences. This history weaves together cold war studies, military history, the rise of government research and development, and aviation and aeronautics with a nascent global awareness. It is a fascinating history of something we all experience--the weather --told through compelling historical characters""--Provided by publisher.

Its idea came from the heritage of the other two cycles of events: RELCOMEX Conferences (1977 – 89) and Microcomputer Schools (1985 – 95) which were then organized by the Institute of Engineering Cybernetics, the previous name of CECR. In contrast to those preceding meetings focused on the conventional reliability analysis, the DepCoS mission is to develop a more comprehensive approach to computer system performability which is now commonly called dependability. Contemporary technical systems are integrated unities of technical, information, organization, software and human resources. Diversity of the processes being realized in the system, their concurrency and their reliance on in-system intelligence significantly impedes construction of strict mathematical models and calls for application of intelligent and soft computing methods. The submissions included in this volume illustrate variety of problems that need to be explored in the dependability analysis: methodologies and practical tools for modelling, design and simulation of the systems, security and confidentiality in information processing, specific issues of heterogeneous, today often wireless, computer networks, or management of transportation networks.

What is supposed to be a quiet affair begins to unravel into a troubling and baffling mystery.  It seems there is no love lost between certain members of the Appleyard family. When Hollywood movie actor Andrew Appleyard appears unexpectedly, the family is in turmoil, especially when Andrew is found dead. Apparently, he has taken his own life, but why would he leave two separate suicide notes, one claiming he was dying of terminal cancer, plus a third in a strange handwriting? The Freers become increasingly suspicious, especially when Andrew's doctor says his patient was in perfect health.  Soon, a mysterious woman in pink arrives at the house and steals one of the wedding presents. When a second body is discovered, Felix and Virginia join forces to unravel the clues of this deadly mystery.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

An Introduction to Fuzzy Control,Dimiter Driankov,physics,First published in 1993,/works/OL19858995W?edition=ia%3Aintroductiontofu00dria,/authors/OL526861A/Dimiter_Driankov,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27046853M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1993|Publisher  Springer Berlin Heidelberg|Language English|Pages 316,"Fuzzy controllers are a class of knowledge based controllers using artificial intelligence techniques with origins in fuzzy logic to compute an appropriate control action. These fuzzy knowledge based controllers can be found either as stand-alone control elements or as integral parts of distributed control systems including conventional controllers in a wide range of industrial process control systems and consumer products. Applications of fuzzy controllers have become a well established practice for Japanese manufacturers of control equipment and systems, and are becoming more and more common for their European and American counterparts. The main aim of this book is to show that fuzzy control is not totally ad hoc, that there exist formal techniques for the analysis of a fuzzy controller, and that fuzzy control can be implemented even when no expert knowledge is available. Thus the book is mainly oriented toward control engineers and theorists rather than fuzzy and non-fuzzy AI people. However, parts can be read without any knowledge of control theory and may be of interest to AI people. The book has six chapters. Chapter 1 introduces two major classes of knowledge based systems for closedloop control. Chapter 2 introduces relevant parts of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. Chapter 3 introduces the principal design parameters of a fuzzy knowledge based controller (FKBC) and discusses their relevance with respect to its performance. Chapter 4 considers an FKBC as a particular type of nonlinear controller. Chapter 5 considers tuning and adaptation of FKBCs, which are nonlinear and so can be designed to cope with a certain amount of nonlinearity. Chapter 6 considers several approaches for stability analysis of FKBCs in the context of classical nonlinear dynamic systems theory.

Beginning with simple models and basic properties of the lens mapping, the book proceeds to more complicated recent analytical and numerical treatments, thereby highlighting the prominent role played by lensing statistics in the interpretation of high-redshift objects. A detailed description of microlensing is given. The potential role of gravitational lenses as astronomical tools, for example, to determine the masses of cosmic objects and the scale of the universe and as natural telescopes, is pointed out. On the observational side, details of several known multiple QSOs, radio rings and luminous arcs, and the difficulties of observation and verification of lens systems are summarized. The basics of catastophe theory, to the extent that it concerns singularities of plane maps, are derived and some techniques for numerical treatments of gravitational lensing are listed.

Coherent control of charge carrier dynamics has evolved into an interdisciplinary topic involving atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, quantum optics, laser spectroscopy, and the physics of electronic devices. This is reflected by the contributions contained in this volume which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind on the issue of coherent control. Containing both review articles and latest results in the field in atomic, molecular, and semiconductor physics, it addresses experts and novices alike. All articles have been reviewed and emphasis has been given to clarity and a detailed list of references.

Aimed at graduate students and researchers, this book describes the theoretical and experimental aspects of the dark matter problem in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Featuring contributions from 48 leading theorists and experimentalists, it presents many aspects, from astrophysical observations to particle physics candidates, and from the prospects for detection at colliders to direct and indirect searches. The book introduces observational evidence for dark matter along with a detailed discussion of the state-of-the-art of numerical simulations and alternative explanations in terms of modified gravity. It then moves on to the candidates arising from theories beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and to the prospects for detection at accelerators. It concludes by looking at direct and indirect dark matter searches, and the prospects for detecting the particle nature of dark matter with astrophysical experiments. -- Describes the theoretical and experimental aspects of the dark matter problem -- Presents observations, theory and experiments to give a complete and consistent understanding of dark matter -- Features contributions from leading experts in the field""--Provided by publisher.

A stochastic modeling approach is used in the mathematical treatment of these problems, which reflects self-organization processes in open dissipative systems. The authors also consider examples of ordering for various objects in space throughout their evolutionary processes.

If found, the Higgs boson would help explain why everything has mass. But there's more at stake-what we're really testing is our capacity to make the universe reasonable. Our best understanding of physics is predicated on something known as quantum field theory. Unfortunately, in its raw form, it doesn't make sense-its outputs are physically impossible infinite percentages when they should be something simpler, like the number 1. The kind of physics that the Higgs boson represents seeks to ""renormalize"" field theory, forcing equations to provide answers that match what we see in the real world.

This dissertation presents the results of ultra-high resolution photoluminescence studies of these centres in specially prepared, highly enriched 28-Si samples. The greatly improved spectral resolution due to this enrichment led to the discovery of isotopic fingerprints. These fingerprints have revealed that the detailed constituents of all of the centres previously studied had been identified incorrectly. They also revealed the existence of several different families of impurity complexes containing either four or five atoms chosen from Li, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. These centres’ constituents have been determined, together with no-phonon transition energies, no-phonon isotope shifts, local vibrational mode energies, and the isotope shifts of the local vibrational mode energies. The data presented here for these centres should prove useful for the currently sought theoretical explanations of their formation, stability, and properties.

As indicated by its title, this volume provides solutions to the exercises in the Primer. However, it also provides a great deal more. Each of the exercises is discussed in detail and, where appropriate, is repeatedly solved using a variety of techniques and approaches. Many of the exercises are deceptively simple, and the reader is led through the thought processes that unravel this simplicity and show the depth of insight that can be obtained by careful analysis. Emphasis is placed on offering the reader a clear and thorough development of the knowledge and insights that can be gained by solving each problem and, as emphasized in the Primer, on the need to confirm that the particle tracking that is the basis of each candidate solution has adequately sampled the regions of phase space that are important to the result. This volume is a useful and valuable companion to the Primer and offers the reader the opportunity to pursue the topics presented in the Primer to greater depth than was possible in that volume. A compact disc containing all of the software presented in both the Primer and the Solutions is included in this volume for the convenience of the user.

General relativity is described in not-too-technical language as an integral part of ordinary classical physics and applied to such practical problems as clock synchronization, laser ranging to satellites or reflectors on the Moon, and very long base line interferometry. The present status of measuring techniques and levels of accuracy in the field are reviewed and it is shown how relativity enters the theoretical analysis of measuring data.

The ability to produce durable low-friction surfaces and lubricant fluids has become an important factor in the miniaturization of moving components in many technological devices, e.g., magnetic storage, recording systems, miniature motors, and aerospace components. This book presents a broad overview of friction and an in-depth treatment of several fundamental and related topics. The emphasis is on experimental and theoretical results obtained during recent years. This monograph will be useful to physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and engineers who want to understand sliding friction. The book (or parts of it) could also form the basis for a modern undergraduate or graduate course on tribology. The author has been honored by the Volvo prize (1981), the Walter-Schottky prize (1996), and the John Yarwood Memorial Medal (1998).

Compound semiconductors, on the other hand, encompass such a wide range of physical and electronic properties that they have become viable competitors in a number of applications. Compound Semiconductor Radiation Detectors is a consolidated source of information on all aspects of the use of compound semiconductors for radiation detection and measurement. Bringing together information scattered across many disciplines, this book summarizes the current status of research in compound semiconductor radiation detectors. It examines the properties, growth, and characterization of compound semiconductors as well as the fabrication of radiation sensors, with particular emphasis on the X- and gamma-ray regimes. It explores the limitations of compound semiconductors and discusses current efforts to improve spectral performances, pointing to where future discoveries may lie. A timely resource for the established researcher, this book serves as a comprehensive and illustrated reference on material science, crystal growth, metrology, detector physics, and spectroscopy. It can also be used as a textbook for those new to the field of compound semiconductors and their application to radiation detection and measurement""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the close-to-surface layer and root-zone layer, vapor flux is the dominant flux controlling these processes - process which, in turn, influence the local climate pattern and the local ecosystem. The work reported in this thesis attempts to understand how the soil airflow affects the vapor transport during evaporation processes, by using a two-phase heat and mass transfer model. The necessity of including the airflow mechanism in land surface process studies is discussed and highlighted.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A primer on the human factors issues that can influence how older adults interact with telehealth systems, Designing Telehealth for an Aging Population: A Human Factors Perspective examines the new ways patients and healthcare providers communicate to achieve the same or better outcomes than with traditional face-to-face healthcare.The authors examine older adult capabilities and provide standards and guidelines for telehealth design, enlivened by clinical examples and tutorials on human factors methodologies. They take a systematic look at how the use of human factors principles can facilitate the successful development, deployment, and maintenance of telehealth technology to better serve the aging population. The authors have carefully stayed away from academic writing, distilling their experience in the form of basic observations and principles drawn from their work. They include suggested readings at the end of each chapter that supply the research underpinning their recommendations. The first reference to cover older adult users in an area that will only get bigger, this book sets itself apart by providing focused coverage of the human factors issues specific to aging populations and practical advice on how to accommodate them""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book gives an introduction to the metallic magnetism, and treats effects of electron correlations on magnetism, spin fluctuations in metallic magnetism, formation of complex magnetic structures, a variety of magnetism due to configurational disorder in alloys as well as a new magnetism caused by the structural disorder in amorphous alloys, especially the itinerant-electron spin glasses. The readers will find that all these topics can be understood systematically  by means of the spin-fluctuation theories based on the functional integral method.

The presentation is based on a solid science foundation that includes well established physical laws of electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, classical and quantum mechanics and other relevant fields of science. Qualitative ideas and descriptions are followed by quantitative derivations and estimates of key physical quantities, and the results of theories and models are confronted with modern observational data obtained from numerous international science programs. Fundamental astrophysical phenomena, such as charged particle acceleration and magnetic field generation, are presented along with spectacular phenomena, such as stellar winds (including ultra-relativistic pulsar wind), supernova explosions and evolution of its remnants, and solar flares.

And every morning, the Sultan lets her live another day—providing the story is interesting enough to capture his attention. After almost one thousand nights, Shahrazad is running out of tales. And that is how Marjan's story begins.  It falls to Marjan to help Shahrazad find new stories—ones the Sultan has never heard before. To do that, Marjan is forced to undertake a dangerous and forbidden mission: sneak from the harem and travel the city, coaxing strangers to tell her stories and bringing them back to Shahrazad. But as she searches the city, a wonderful thing happens. Marjan, who had been just a quiet spinner of tales when the story began, becomes the center of a story more surprising than she ever imagined.

The biomechanics of and biomaterials used in orthopedics have become increasingly important as the possibilities have increased to treat patients with foreign material introduced both as optimized osteosynthesis after trauma and as arthroplasties for joint diseases, sequelae of trauma or for tumor treatment. Furthermore, biomaterial substitutes are constantly being developed to replace missing tissue. Biomechanics and Biomaterials in Orthopedics provides an important update within this highly important field. Professor Dominique Poitout has collected a series of high-quality chapters by globally renowned researchers and clinicians. Under the auspices of the International Society of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology (SICOT) and International Society of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Research (SIROT), this book now provides permanent and specific access to the considerable international knowledge in the field of locomotor system trauma and disease treatment using the novel bioengineering solutions. This book covers both basic concepts concerning biomaterials and biomechanics as well as their clinical application and the experience from everyday practical use. This book will be of great value to specialists in orthopedics and traumatology, while also provide an important basis for graduate and postgraduate learning.

Its scope is to give an overview of this complex field of research, starting with the discovery of cosmic rays (Victor Hess, 1912) until the current experiments with particle telescopes.The book focuses on the ways in which physics changes in the course of this history. The following changes run parallel, overlap, and/orinteract: - Discovery of effects like X-rays, radioactivity, cosmic rays, new  particles, the Cosmic Microwave Background and its anisotropies, but also progress through non-discoveries (monopoles) etc. - The change of the description of nature in physics, as consequence of  the scientific revolutions at the beginning of the 20th century, giving rise to quantum physics, relativity, etc. - The shifts from particle physics to cosmology and to particle physics  with cosmic accelerators. - The change of experimental methods, cooperations, and disciplinary divisions. With regard to the latter change, a main topic of the book is to make the specific multi-disciplinary features of astroparticle physics clear to undergraduate and graduate students, historians of physics, and philosophers of science.

The Second Edition contains four new chapters devoted primarily to applications of acoustical principles in everyday life: Microphones and Other Transducers; Sound in Concert Halls and Studios; Sound and Noise Outdoors; and Underwater Sound. Rossing and Fletcher present the physics of mechanical vibrating systems, emphasizing normal modes of vibration. Beginning with the basics of free and forced motions of simple harmonic oscillator (with electrical analogs indicated where appropriate), they then proceed to vibrations in one-dimensional systems, such as strings and bars, and two-dimensional systems, such as membranes and plates. The discussion of coupled systems includes strong as well as weak coupling and presents both mechanical and electrical examples. The treatment includes a fairly detailed discussion of nonlinear systems and self-excited oscillators, as well as a brief explanation of modal analysis, including finite-element methods and modal testing. The second part of the book discusses the propagation of sound in air, including radiation, transmission, absorption, and diffraction. This treatment of radiation covers point, dipole, line, plane and other sources, both with and without baffles, and the propagation of sound in various kinds and shapes of pipes, horns and other acoustics components. About the authors: Thomas Rossing is Professor Emeritus of Physics at Northern Illinois University. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, Acoustical Society of America and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has authored 10 other books. Neville Fletcher is Professor Emeritus of Physics of the University of New England in Australia and is now a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University. He is a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Acoustical Societies of both America and Australia, and the Institutes of Physics of both Australia and the UK.

In particular, The Construction of Spin Eigenfunctions presents all aspects connected with the construction of spin eigenfunctions, and their relationship with many-electron antisymmetric wave functions. This book treats new aligorithms in a way that no previous books have. The Construction of Spin Eigenfunctions opens with a brief theoretical introduction.  Due to the increasing importance of spin eigenfunctions in quantum chemistry, Dr. Pauncz has followed up with two helpful chapters on the symmetric group and its representations. The author has also calculated matrix elements of the Hamiltonian using spin eigenfunctions. Dr. Pauncz wraps up the book with an important new technique: the spin-coupled valence bond method.  This book should be very useful to graduate students working in the field of molecular quantum mechanics. It also could be used as a text for a one-semester graduate course in physics or in chemistry.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whilst covering the traditional topics of established older textbooks, it also takes up new developments in theoretical concepts and materials that are connected with such breakthroughs as the quantum-Hall effects, the high-Tc superconductors, and the low-dimensional systems realized in solids. Thus, besides providing the fundamental concepts to describe the physics of the electrons and ions comprising the solid, including their interactions, the book provides a link to the experimental facts and gives the reader an excellent insight into current research fields. A compilation of review problems makes the book especially valuable to both students and teachers. The new edition offers an additional chapter on the interaction of light and matter, plus end-of-chapter problems and solutions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Based on a vast technical literature, the present ideas are summarised, compared with each other and generalised whenever possible. Particular stress is laid on explaining the basic terms, describing effects of energy dissipation on various neighboring fields and presenting prototype experiences with hydraulic jump dissipators. These structures are also compared with other means of energy dissipation found in dam engineering. As a result civil engineers working both in practice and in research may gain an impression of what is actually being done in a rapidly expanding field of applied hydraulics, and obtain additional information on a subject in which reference books are rare.

It presents for the first time in book form a general theory of symmetry reduction which allows one to reduce the symmetries in the spherical pendulum and the Lagrange top. Also the monodromy obstruction to the existence of global action angle coordinates is calculated for the spherical pendulum and the Lagrange top. The book addresses professional mathematicians and graduate students and can be used as a textbook on advanced classical mechanics or global analysis.

V., Aachen, Germany, during the academic year of 1957-1958. The subject matter has been rewritten and expanded after the author's return to the University of Maryland. The purpose of this book is to give a theoretical introduction to plasma dynamics and magnetogasdynamics from the gasdynamic point of view. Attention is given to the basic assumptions and the formulation of the theory of the flow problems of a plasma, an ionized gas, as well as to the various methods of solving these problems. Since plasma dynamics is still in a developing stage, the author hopes that this book _may furnish the readers some basic elements in the theory of plasma -dynamics so that they may find it useful for further study and research in this new field. After the introduction in which the scope of plasma. dynamics is briefly discussed, the fundamental equations of plasma dynamics from the macro scopic point of view, i. e., the theory of continuum has been analyzed, in detail in chapters IT to IV, including many simplified cases sUQh as m, agneto gasdynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, electromaguetodynamics, radiation magnetogasdynamics etc. In chapter V, the important parameters and their range of applicatIons have been treated. The parameters are useful in the correlation of experi mental results.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century,Edward Grant,physics,First published in 2007,/works/OL2941370W?edition=ia%3Ahistorynaturalph00gran,/authors/OL448559A/Edward_Grant,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL7752126M-M.jpg,"Publish Date January 22, 2007|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English|Pages 376","Natural philosophy encompassed all natural phenomena of the physical world. It sought to discover the physical causes of all natural effects and was little concerned with mathematics. By contrast, the exact mathematical sciences were narrowly confined to various computations that did not involve physical causes, functioning totally independently of natural philosophy. Although this began slowly to change in the late Middle Ages, a much more thoroughgoing union of natural philosophy and mathematics occurred in the seventeenth century and thereby made the Scientific Revolution possible. The title of Isaac Newton's great work, The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, perfectly reflects the new relationship. Natural philosophy became the 'Great Mother of the Sciences', which by the nineteenth century had nourished the manifold chemical, physical, and biological sciences to maturity, thus enabling them to leave the 'Great Mother' and emerge as the multiplicity of independent sciences we know today.

High-Pressure Shock Compression of Solids IV,Lee Davison,physics,First published in 1997,/works/OL19855380W?edition=ia%3Ahighpressureshoc00grah,/authors/OL3428584A/Lee_Davison,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27043536M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Springer New York|Language English|Pages 342,"Much of the current interest in shock compression of porous solids stems from the desire to bond hard, refractory powders into strong and dense solids. However, while much is known about the effects of shock compression on monolithic materials, the unusual physical and chemical processes that take place when a porous medium is shocked have been little studied thus far. This volume -- with contributions by leading researchers in condensed matter physics, physical chemistry, metallurgy, mechanics, and materials science -- begins to address that gap. The focus is on heterogeneous deformation mechanisms, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and chemical processes. The contributions discuss such topics as modeling the complex interplay of thermal, mechanical, and chemical processes; experimental data on pore collapse and their interpretation; and synthesis of new materials through shock-induced chemical reactions. By presenting not only the most recent results, but also the open questions that remain, these essays convey the excitement of developing a scientific basis for understanding shock compression of highly porous solids. Topics covered include > Shock Compression Science in Highly Porous Solids > Shock Loading of Porous High Explosives > Continuum Mixture Modeling of Reactive Porous Media > Two-Phase Media Model of Shock Compression with Chemical reaction > Constitutive Modeling of Shock-Induced Reactions in Powder Mixtures > Discrete-element Modeling of Shock Processes in Powders.

Toni Yancey finds that despite our best intentions and repeated resolutions to exercise, as well as a 40-year investment in fitness education and counseling, physical activity in all levels of society continues to plummet. In a warm, reader-friendly narrative that draws on solid scientific research, personal experience, and her own poetry, Yancey calls for a radically different approach: one that respects diversity and is grounded in the cultures of those most at risk. Instant Recess proposes regular ten-minute exercise breaks that utilize music and dance and are easily incorporated into school, work, and community life. Rather than encouraging unhealthful habits like cigarette breaks or high fat snacks, these ""instant recesses"" make the active choice the natural one. Here is a new paradigm for fitness and public health that promises vitality, well being, and a greater sense of community -- demonstrating, as Yancey argues, that what's good for the waistline is good for the bottom line. - Publisher.

Building on his own radical innovations in quantum theory, Heisenberg proved that in many physical measurements, you can obtain one bit of information only at the price of losing another. Heisenberg's principle implied that scientific quantities/concepts do not have absolute, independent meaning, but acquire meaning only in terms of the experiments used to measure them. This proposition, undermining the cherished belief that science could reveal the physical world with limitless detail and precision, placed Heisenberg in direct opposition to the revered Albert Einstein. The eminent scientist Niels Bohr, Heisenberg's mentor and Einstein's long-time friend, found himself caught between the two.Uncertainty chronicles the birth and evolution of one of the most significant findings in the history of science, and portrays the clash of ideas and personalities it provoked. Einstein was emotionally as well as intellectually determined to prove the uncertainty principle false. Heisenberg represented a new generation of physicists who believed that quantum theory overthrew the old certainties; confident of his reasoning, Heisenberg dismissed Einstein's objections. Bohr understood that Heisenberg was correct, but he also recognized the vital necessity of gaining Einstein's support as the world faced the shocking implications of Heisenberg's principle.

The overall understanding of each of these areas is still incomplete; nevertheless, with the foundations laid by studies in the more traditional systems there is no doubt that these new areas will advance mesoscopic electron transport to a new phenomenological level, both experimentally and theoretically. Mesoscopic Electron Transport highlights selected areas in the field, provides a comprehensive review of such systems, and also serves as an introduction to the new and developing areas of mesoscopic electron transport.

In 1965, when the authors were students in one of the first Pediatric Nurse Practitioner programs at the University of Colorado, the idea of nurses using stethoscopes, otoscopes, and other instruments traditionally assigned to the physician was heralded with a great deal of skepticism. This book provides a detailed guide for the nurse learning the skills of physical diagnosis. It is designed to help any nurse interested in improving her skills of physical assessment. Each chapter of the book is divided into a discussion of why an examination of a portion of the body is important, a review of the anatomy, a description of the method to be used in the examination, a description of the instruments to be used, and some discussion of conditions of which the nurse should be aware when examining that particular portion of the body. - Preface.

Both earlier editions of the book were widely used for introductory practical astronomy courses in many universities.In this Third Edition the author guides the reader through the mathematics, physics and practical techniques needed to use today's telescopes (from the smaller models to the larger instruments installed in many colleges) and how to find objects in the sky. Most of the physics and engineering involved is described fully and requires little prior knowledge or experience.Both visual and electronic imaging techniques are covered, together with an introduction to how data (measurements) should be processed and analyzed. A simple introduction to radio telescopes is also included. Brief coverage of the more advanced topics of photometry and spectroscopy are included, but mainly to enable the reader to see some of the developments possible from the basic observing techniques covered in the rest of the book.For anyone intending to enter astronomy as a professional, an understanding of the physics is essential - and this newest version of Telescopes and Techniques is one of the best starting points!

The most interesting topics requiring special relativity are covered, including: Spacetime Vectors in Spacetime Electromagnetism Asymptotic Momentum Conservation Covectors and Dyadics in Spacetime Energy Tensor Although the book is not meant for the complete beginner in special relativity, the mathematical prerequisites for the early chapters of the book are very few - linear algebra and elementary geometry (done using vectors and a scalar product).

Structural Aspects of Quantum Field Theory and Noncommutative Geometry,Gerhard Grensing,physics,First published in 2013,/works/OL27089459W,/authors/OL8055019A/Gerhard_Grensing,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  World Scientific|Language English,"This book is devoted to the subject of quantum field theory. It is divided into two volumes. The first can serve as a textbook on the main techniques and results of quantum field theory, while the second treats more recent developments, in particular the subject of quantum groups and noncommutative geometry, and their interrelation. The first volume is directed at graduate students who want to learn the basic facts about quantum field theory. It begins with a gentle introduction to classical field theory, including the standard model of particle physics, general relativity, and also supergravity. The transition to quantized fields is performed with path integral techniques, by means of which the one-loop renormalization of a self-interacting scalar quantum field, of quantum electrodynamics, and the asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics is treated. In the last part of the first volume, the application of path integral methods to systems of quantum statistical mechanics is covered. The book ends with a rather detailed investigation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, and gives a stringent derivation of Laughlin's trial ground state wave function as an exact ground state. The second volume covers more advanced themes. In particular Connes' noncommutative geometry is dealt with in some considerable detail; the presentation attempts to acquaint the physics community with the substantial achievements that have been reached by means of this approach towards the understanding of the elusive Higgs particle. The book also covers the subject of quantum groups and its application to the fractional quantum Hall effect, as it is for this paradigmatic physical system that noncommutative geometry and quantum groups can be brought together.

This book examines the physical principles underlying the workings of clocks--from the earliest mechanical clocks to the present-day sophisticated clocks based on the properties of individual atoms. Intended for non-specialists with some knowledge of physics or engineering,the book treats the material in a broad intuitive manner, with a minimum of mathematical formalism. The presentation covers a broad range of salient topics relevant to the measurement of frequency and time intervals. The main focus is on electronic time-keeping: clocks based on quartz crystal oscillators and, at greater length, atomic clocks based on quantum resonance in rubidium, cesium, and hydrogen atoms, and, more recently, mercury ions. The book treats the revolutionary changes that the optical laser has wrought on atomic standards through laser cooling and optical pumping, and it discusses the application of these clocks to global navigation--in particular Loran-C and the Global Positioning System. The book also touches on such topics as atomic resonance line shape, the relativistic Doppler effect and general notions of time, including the relativity of future and past, the clock paradox, the Sagnac effect and finally, time reversal symmetry.

It thus discusses the basic theory and physical principles underlying the operation of the various sensors as well as the practical aspects of their operation and their incorporation into larger systems. The intent is to cover the most important topics in electronics, sensors, measurements, and acquisition systems, always keeping in mind the needs of practicing scientists and engineers. The presentation focuses on systems controlled by desktop personal computers running a high-level program and operating through internal cards or an external bus connected to instruments, rather than the specialized microprocessors discussed in older texts. The book will thus be useful to students in a wide variety of experimental sciences and engineering disciplines, including physics, chemistry, mechanical, nuclear, and electrical engineering, experimental psychology, biology, and geophysics.

Condon's major contributions were in atomic and molecular physics and spectroscopy; his book with G.H. Shortley on The Theory of Atomic Spectra dominated the field of spectroscopy for half a century and remains an invaluable reference. He also played an important role in the institutions of American science. He served for many years as the editor of Reviews of Modern Physics, and with Hugh Odishaw he edited the still widely used Handbook of Physics. After World War II, Condon became director of the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), and helped to make it one of the premier research laboratories in the physical sciences in the world. The Selected Scientific Papers reprint many of the most important contributions Condon made to atomic physics, quantum theory, nuclear physics, condensed-matter physics and other fields. The Selected Popular Writings contain articles he wrote on technical topics for such journals as The American Journal of Physics, Science, and Nature, as well as reflections on education, UFO's, and other topics.

As climate catastrophe looms closer, people are eager to learn what degrowth is about, and whether we can save the planet by changing how we live. This book is an introduction to the movement.  As politicians and corporations obsess over growth objectives, the degrowth movement demands that we must slow down the economy by transforming our economies, our politics and our cultures to live within the Earth's limits.  This book navigates the practice and strategies of the movement, looking at its strengths and weaknesses. Covering horizontal democracy, local economies and the reduction of work, it shows us why degrowth is a compelling and realistic project.

Liquid Metals,David K. Belashchenko,physics,First published in 2018,/works/OL21633601W,/authors/OL8274403A/David_K._Belashchenko,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2018|Publisher  Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated|Language English|Pages 558","Basic problems concerning the computer simulation of liquid metals in usual and extreme conditions with the use of interparticle potentials, mainly multi-particle potentials of the embedded atom model are considered in the book. The general questions of a structure of simple liquids, and the methods of simulation of non-crystalline systems (liquid and amorphous) - a method of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, quantum-mechanical modeling, etc. - are considered in the first five chapters. The types of interparticle potentials applied, the analysis of atomistic models, topological characteristics of liquids, and the results of modeling one-component and binary systems with the use of the simplest interparticle potentials are considered. In the second part of the book, a specification of interparticle interaction is given for 17 metals of the various groups of the periodic system with the use of the embedded atom model. Parameters of potentials under ambient pressure are found using the experimental data about properties of metal on the binodal, and for strongly compressed states via the metal properties found in Hugoniot adiabatic processes. The role of electronic terms in energy is considered in detail. Tables of the potentials are given in the Appendix. Then, thermodynamic, structural and diffusion properties of these metals in wide intervals of the pressure and temperatures are calculated (usually to hundreds of GPa and tens of thousands of Kelvin). The results of the calculations are tabulated. In the final chapters of the book, specific problems with respect to liquid metals are considered. Here, the problems of the structure and conditions in the center of the Earth, Moon and Jupiter satellites, calculations of shock adiabats, and the isotopic effect of diffusion are covered. The assessments of structure and temperature in the inner and outer cores of the Earth are given. Calculations of a series of shock adiabats for the initially porous or liquid metal samples are carried out, and questions of accuracy concerning the available experimental data are analyzed. Also, some non-classical mechanisms of liquid solidification, in particular, the cluster mechanism of solidification during strong overcooling, are discussed. The general problems of the thermodynamic description of nanoclusters are considered. The ambiguity of the use of the radius, volume, surface area and surface tension concepts for nanoclusters is shown, and a more reasonable approach is suggested. The series of nanoclusters of various sizes are constructed for several metals, and the dependence of their properties on the cluster size, including a melting temperature, are investigated. The possibility to compare the applicability of the Second Law of Thermodynamics in its usual form to the melting/solidification of nanoclusters is discussed.

Each of the seventy-two handwritten pages of Einstein's seminal work are faithfully reproduced here and are accompanied on their facing pages by an English translation of the original German text."" ""A tribute to Einstein's genius, Einstein's 1912 Manuscript on the Special Theory of Relativity opens with a brief essay by Hanoch Gutfreund, a chronology of Einstein's life, and, to introduce the manuscript, a detailed description of the manuscript, its contents, publication history, and provenance. The manuscript pages themselves then follow, reproduced in full color, with the English translation facing each page."" ""Subtle variations in paper and ink are clearly visible in the excellent reproductions, indicating where and when Einstein drafted certain parts of this scientific masterpiece. Because the manuscript shows extensive reworking, it reveals Einstein's thought processes more than any other of his handwritten works, inviting the reader to either imaginatively or actually toil alongside Einstein toward the completion of this elegant proof.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

I couldn't be naked with anybody, couldn't wear a backless dress, couldn't go to the beach—all the things a person should be able to do.""When Muhammad Ali's daughter Khaliah hit 325 pounds, she didn't need to be told again that she was morbidly obese. A lifetime of dieting, of starving, had not helped. She thought about gastric bypass surgery but couldn't pursue it after reading the statistic that as many as one in twenty-five people suffers complications, and sometimes death, from the operation. She could not afford to risk leaving her young son without a mother.Miserable, depressed, and unable to walk up a flight of stairs without losing her breath, she did not know which way to turn—until a friend pointed her toward a new type of surgery called gastric banding. It is just as effective as gastric bypass with a fraction of potential complications. With the band placed around her stomach and completely taking away her hunger, Khaliah slimmed down to half her former size. The band she used has been the surgical option of choice in Europe for more than a decade but is only just now arriving in the United States. It is sure to become number one here too. Unlike gastric bypass surgery, gastric banding is reversible, is completely safe during pregnancy, involves no nutritional deficiencies, and best of all, takes away hunger forever, not just for the first year or so.Khaliah wraps her story of weight loss in this memoir of what it was like to grow up the daughter of one of the world's most famous men, and teams up with her surgeons at the New York University Medical Center to detail the lifetime of misery suffered by an obese girl; the ins and outs of the banding operation; and the joy, serenity, and health resulting from a solution that until now had eluded her.

She was a kind, hard-working woman, devoted to doing her best for others. Yet her good deeds had not been repaid: someone had brought her life to a violent, horrifying end.  He appeared to be a quiet, gentle person who would not have harmed a fly. Yet when his body was discovered lying in a pool of blood, it was apparent that his last moments were anything but peaceful.  The two murders, coming so close together, had rather upset Virginia Freer. She had known both victims, if only casually. She did not know why, but suspicions about the killings gradually began to haunt her--and slowly revealed the links in a bizarre, twisted chain of events that had united the two people in death.

Complex systems constitute an almost universal class of materials including associated liquids, polymers, biomolecules, colloids, porous materials, doped ferroelectric crystals, nanomaterials, etc. These systems are characterized by a new ""mesoscopic"" length scale, intermediate between molecular and macroscopic. The mesoscopic structures of complex systems typically arise from fluctuations or competing interactions and exhibit a rich variety of static and dynamic behaviour. This growing field is interdisciplinary; it complements solid state and statistical physics, and overlaps considerably with chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, and biology. A common theme in complex systems is that while such materials are disordered on the molecular scale and homogeneous on the macroscopic scale, they usually possess a certain degree of order on an intermediate, or mesoscopic, scale due to the delicate balance of interaction and thermal effects. In the present Volume it is shown how the dielectric spectroscopy studies of complex systems can be applied to determine both their structures and dynamics.

What are the elastic parameters that determine whether a component will survive a certain acceleration? After an introduction to the elements of structural analysis and finite-element analysis, the author turns to components, data and testing. A discussion of leadless chip carriers leads to a detailed thermal analysis of pin grid arrays. For compliant leaded systems, both mechanical (bending and twisting) and thermal stresses are discussed in detail. The book concludes with discussions of the dynamic response of circuit cards, plated holes in cards and boards, and the final assembly of cards and boards.

The field is inspected from an experimental point of view and the results are interpreted within the framework of the existing theoretical models. The book discusses our current understanding of the unusual physical properties of quasicrystals, as well as highlighting the challenges associated with the physical interpretation of the properties of these complex and fascinating materials. The book is written by a team of active researchers and conveys the sense of an excitement associated with research in a rapidly developing area of new alloys. A wealth of measured experimental data is presented and important information is given in a convenient tabular form. Although the book is aimed at a broad audience interested in the intriguing physical properties of these novel alloys, it will be of general use both to long-time workers in the field and uninitiated graduate students.

The properties of a large variety of new polymers based on polythiophenes, polyabilines, polyvinylenes, polyarenemethylidenes, Ligothienylenes, Langmir-Blodgett films, carbon polymers, oligomers and clusters are compiled. In addition, basic concepts for the design of new polymers are described. Special attention is paid to narrow band-gap polymers, systems with finite conjugation, processable polymers, and their nonlinear optical properties. Particular emphasis is placed on problems of orientation and dimensionality of conjugated systems.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Intermediate calculations are presented in complete detail. Problems at the end of each chapter help students to consolidate their understanding of the material. Beyond the fundamentals, this text demonstrates the breadth of the field and its great variety of applications. Modern areas such as renormalization group theory, percolation, stochastic equations of motion and their applications to critical dynamics, as well as fundamental considerations of irreversibility, are discussed. The text will be useful for advanced students of physics and other natural sciences; a basic knowledge of quantum mechanics is presumed.

So far, single-phase flows in porous media have been treated or at least formulated satisfactorily, while the subject of two-phase flow and the related heat-transfer in porous media is still in its infancy. This book identifies the principles of transport in porous media and compares the avalaible predictions based on theoretical treatments of various transport mechanisms with the existing experimental results. The theoretical treatment is based on the volume-averaging of the momentum and energy equations with the closure conditions necessary for obtaining solutions. While emphasizing a basic understanding of heat transfer in porous media, this book does not ignore the need for predictive tools; whenever a rigorous theoretical treatment of a phenomena is not avaliable, semi-empirical and empirical treatments are given.
