Featuring more than 50 recipes, and illustrated with color photography throughout, these great recipes are all prepared in healthful versions that use vegan alternatives to rich cream, butter, and meat. The result is a terrific addition to the culinary resources of any cook interested in either vegan or Indian cuisine.  Singla--a mother of two, Indian emigre, and former TV news journalist--has a distinctive style and voice that brings alive her passion for easy, authentic Indian food. Some of these recipes were developed by her mother through the years, but many Singla developed herself, including fusion recipes that pull together diverse traditions from across the Indian subcontinent. She shows the busy, harried family that cooking healthy is simple and that cooking Indian is just a matter of understanding a few key spices.  As Singla sees it, acquiring and using the proper spices is the key to preparing her healthful recipes at home. Singla has recently brought to market her own line of traditional Indian spice trays (also known as a masala dabba), which is being sold by retail outlets like Williams-Sonoma. Vegan Indian Cooking builds off of Singla's vast expertise in simplifying and perfecting Indian spices and unique, custom spice blends, making delicious Indian cooking accessible to even the most hurried home chef""--  """"A guide to preparing favorite recipes from the Indian tradition using entirely vegan ingredients""--Provided by publisher""--   Read more Read less",10 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Knopf|Language English,"What does it take to perfect a flawless éclair? A delicate yet buttery croissant? To pipe dozens of macarons? The answer is: an intimate knowledge of the fundamentals of pastry. In The Art of French Pastry award-winning pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, cofounder of the renowned French Pastry School in Chicago, gives you just that. By teaching you how to make everything from pâte à choux to pastry cream, Pfeiffer builds on the basics until you have an understanding of the science behind the ingredients used, how they interact with one another, and what your hands have to do to transform them into pastry. This yields glorious results! Expect to master these techniques and then indulge in exquisite recipes, such as: brioche, napoléons / Mille-Feuilles, cream puffs, Alsatian cinnamon rolls / chinois, lemon cream tart with meringue teardrops, elephant ears / palmiers, black forest cake, beignets, as well as some traditional Alsatian savory treats, including: Pretzels, Kougelhof, Tarte Flambée, Warm Alsatian Meat Pie. Pastry is all about precision, so Pfeiffer presents us with an amazing wealth of information—lists of necessary equipment, charts on how ingredients react in different environments, and the precise weight of ingredients in grams, with a look at their equivalent in U.S. units -- which will help you in all aspects of your cooking. But in order to properly enjoy your ""just desserts,"" so to speak, you will also learn where these delicacies originated. Jacquy Pfeiffer comes from a long line of pastry chefs and has been making these recipes since he was a child working in his father's bakery in Alsace. Sprinkled with funny, charming memories from a lifetime in pastry, this book will have you fully appreciating the hundreds of years of tradition that shaped these recipes into the classics that we know and love, and can now serve to our friends and families over and over again. The Art of French Pastry, full of gorgeous photography and Pfeiffer's accompanying illustrations, is a master class in pastry from a master teacher. - Publisher.

Tracking his own strange and unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe-traveling professional eater and drinker, and even to fatherhood, Bourdain takes no prisoners as he dissects what he's seen, pausing along the way for a series of confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the most controversial figures in food.Beginning with a secret and highly illegal after-hours gathering of powerful chefs that he compares to a mafia summit, Bourdain pulls back the curtain—but never pulls his punches—on the modern gastronomical revolution, as only he can. Cutting right to the bone, Bourdain sets his sights on some of the biggest names in the foodie world, including David Chang, the young superstar chef who has radicalized the fine-dining landscape; the revered Alice Waters, whom he treats with unapologetic frankness; the Top Chef winners and losers; and many more.And always he returns to the question ""Why cook?"" Or the more difficult ""Why cook well?"" Medium Raw is the deliciously funny and shockingly delectable journey to those answers, sure to delight philistines and gourmands alike.

It would have been easier to allow life to pass her by than to continue fighting her weight problem, but she made the difficult decision to take back control. In 2001, Susan underwent gastric bypass surgery and started on a journey that would not only cut her body weight in half but would change her life. Before & After is both a memoir and a cookbook—an intimate account of Leach's own transformation as well as a guide for those who have undergone or are considering the procedure. As Leach has learned in the six years since her operation, weight-loss surgery is not an event with a finish line or a goal weight—it is the beginning of a new way of life.This edition of Before & After has been updated with all that Leach has learned on her post-op journey. It includes a foreword by Leach's surgeon, advice from a nutritionist, answers to more frequently asked questions about weight-loss surgery, a whole chapter on meal plans for different post-operative stages, suggested menus for early food stages, additional questions and answers affecting longer-term post-ops, and new information about products that have entered the marketplace. Most notably, this edition showcases a wealth of new recipes that utilize the latest in light and healthy ingredients for smart and savory results, including everything from Asian Meatballs with Peanut Sauce and Turkey Tenderloin with Apple Chipotle Chutney to sugar-free Pistachio Gelato and Lemon Almond Sponge Cake. Each recipe makes about four servings, but includes a measured serving for WLS people along with a calorie/carb/fat/protein count. Leach has recipes for every step of the way, from tastes-like-the-real-thing milk shakes for those first post-op days to an entire Thanksgiving menu.Before & After is a journal of Leach's own inspirational story, where she shares her ups and downs, her tips and techniques, but mostly it's a book of hope for anyone who has a serious weight problem.

The Paleo bread bible,Anna Conrad,cooking,First published in 2014,/works/OL19984369W?edition=ia%3Apaleobreadbiblem0000conr,/authors/OL7519941A/Anna_Conrad,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27164497M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Language English|Pages 229,"""When Chef and caterer Anna Conrad was asked to provide paleo recipes for a fitness group's 28-day paleo challenge, she was a little skeptical. Could an athlete-or even an average person-really maintain a balanced body without any grains or dairy? Before agreeing to the job, she decided to follow the diet for two weeks to see how she felt. In that short amount of time, she lost eight pounds without feeling hungry or deprived, and her blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol all stayed within healthy limits. She gladly provided the recipes and now offers a paleo menu as a regular part of her catering business. But what about bread? How can you make bread without grains? In this book, Conrad teaches how to make wholesome and satisfying breads with almond flour, coconut flour, and a host of other delicious, non-grain flours. Recipes include: Almond Sandwich Bread - Coconut Sandwich Bread - Rosemary and Olive Oil Bread - Caraway Bread - Onion Pletzel - Limpa - And many more! From sweet breads to sandwich breads, Italian favorites to Swedish delights, this book has something for every bread lover. ""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Cheese and culture,Paul Kindstedt,cooking,First published in 2012,/works/OL16318765W?edition=ia%3Acheeseculturehis00paul,/authors/OL1424687A/Paul_Kindstedt,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25122027M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Chelsea Green Pub.|Language English,"""Behind every traditional type of cheese there is a fascinating story. By examining the role of the cheesemaker throughout world history and by understanding a few basic principles of cheese science and technology, we can see how different cheeses have been shaped by and tailored to their surrounding environment, as well as defined by their social and cultural context. Cheese and Culture endeavors to advance our appreciation of cheese origins by viewing human history through the eyes of a cheese scientist. There is also a larger story to be told, a grand narrative that binds all cheeses together into a single history that started with the discovery of cheese making and that is still unfolding to this day. This book reconstructs that 9000-year story based on the often fragmentary information that we have available. Cheese and Culture embarks on a journey that begins in the Neolithic Age and winds its way through the ensuing centuries to the present. This tour through cheese history intersects with some of the pivotal periods in human prehistory and ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and modern history that have shaped western civilization, for these periods also shaped the lives of cheesemakers and the diverse cheeses that they developed. The book offers a useful lens through which to view our twenty-first century attitudes toward cheese that we have inherited from our past, and our attitudes about the food system more broadly. This refreshingly original book will appeal to anyone who loves history, food, and especially good cheese""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

False Start in Paradise: Cook Islands Self-government,Iaveta Short,cooking,First published in 2020,/works/OL24386110W,/authors/OL9178849A/Iaveta_Short,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32294590M-M.jpg,"Publish Date Aug 03, 2020|Publisher  Moana Publishing|Pages 394","After sixty-five years under New Zealand control, the Cook Islands adopted the United Nations push for self-government which it achieved in 1965, led by the enigmatic Albert Henry.    But the early promise was left unfulfilled as Henry, attempting to build a self-serving empire, manipulated the political system and used Government funds to stay in power. This led to a major court battle where for the first time a government was overturned by a court decision. It ushered in another enigmatic leader, Sir Tom Davis, who had spent many years in the US with the NASA space programme. Davis changed the direction of the Cook Islands to a liberal, free market, open economy.    Decades of political seesawing followed as the Cook Islands tried to right its political and economic boat in the turbulent winds of a tiny democracy. Too often its mishaps and false starts resulted from lots of enthusiasm but little knowledge and experience running a modern democracy.    This book is an attempt to record many of the events and people that contributed to this enthralling, difficult and politically turbulent period in the short life of a tiny island democracy.

This Companion outlines the enormous variety of cuisines, food materials and dishes that collectively fall under the term 'Indian food'. The dominant flavour of this gastronomic Companion is historical. It draws upon material from a variety of sources - literature, archaeology, epigraphic records, anthropology, philology, and botanical and genetic studies - which throw up a gamut of interesting facts pertaining to the origins and evolution of Indian food. The first few chapters are arranged chronologically, beginning with prehistoric times and ending with British rule. One chapter is solely devoted to regional cuisines, though these find mention in other chapters as well. The theories and classification of food as codified by ancient Indian doctors (Charaka, Sushrutha, and Bhagvata, c. third to fourth centuries AD), is the subject of one whole chapter. Another, titled, 'Indian Food Ethos', deals with the customs, rituals and beliefs observed by different communities and religious groups. There is, at a number of places, considerable discussion on the etymology of food-words and their interplay with words in other Indian and foreign languages. The accounts of foreign visitors, such as Xuan Zang and Al Biruni, are cited for the food available as well as the food practices of those bygone times. A chapter on the history of meat eating and the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the gradual shift towards vegetarianism with the advent of Buddhism and Jainism, is equally rich in detail. Sophisticated cooking accoutrements such as the baking oven, liquor distillation unit, and other illuminating facts are presented in a chapter titled 'Utensils and Food Preparation'. In short, this Companion is a rich storehouse of fascinating information on Indian food and everything connected with it.   Read more Read less",11 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

You might start out the night with a drink from Andrew like the Pines (with gin, Cynar, and stone pine liqueur, it's a walk in the woods) or the Norseman (a Scandinavian take on the old-fashioned, with aquavit). In addition to creating new tastes, he also has a passion for perfecting the classics behind the bar, from the Pimm's Cup to hot buttered rum. Andrew shares more than just recipes in Northern Hospitality, though. You'll also see lessons on batching cocktails, warm drinks, and Mezcal to name a few. After a drink, move on to food inspired by both Portland and Scandinavia. The bar snacks are addictive; green chile popcorn, cured venison, and house-made pretzels, are just the beginning --smorgasbords feature smoked fish, cheese, and house-made cider pickles. Swedish meatballs with spaetzle and nutmeg cream are sure to warm you up. Or go further from the known with the nori hashbrowns and trout roe. Features on ice fishing, shucking oysters, how to build a bonfire, and apres-ski provide a sense of place and an experience as unique as the club itself.

So-called new Southern has taken the culinary world by storm, mixing the standards of traditional Southern with current ingedients and flavors that embody world cuisines. At his Seviche restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, Anthony Lamas marries his Latin roots with the best ingredients of the South, creating innovative Southern dishes with plenty of personality. Here you'll find Neuvo Latino Shrimp and Grits, Apple and Bourbon Pecan Bread Pudding, Indiana Sweet Corn and Country Ham Chowder, and Macadamia Crusted Striped Bass with Red Chile Bluegrass Soy Butter. Anthony's food reflects his life's experiences, from his Latin heritage to the street vendors of Los Angeles, life on a farm as a young boy, culinary training in southern California, and the cuisine of the South after he moved to Kentucky. Anthony calls his style of cooking modern Southern that reflects the flavors of his life. In this first cookbook, Southern Heat, Anthony's pride in being part of the largest American regional food movement is evident. His appreciation for his heritage, mentors and local farmers, his dedication to using sustainable ingredients, and his passion for layering flavors to achieve the perfect balance between brightness, citrus, acidity, heat and spice is conveyed through stories and tips as well as through stunning photography that sets the foundation for the more than 125 inspired recipes.

You won't look at a bagel the same way again! In America the Edible, Travel Channel host Adam Richman tackles the ins and outs of American cuisine, demonstrating his own unique brand of culinary anthropology. Believing that regional cuisine reveals far more than just our taste for chicken fried steak or 3-way chili, Richman explores the ethnic, economic, and cultural factors that shape the way we eat and how food, in turn, reflects who we are as a nation. Richman uses his signature wit and casual charm to take youon a tour around the country,explaining such curiosities as why bagels are shaped like circles, why fried chicken is so popular in the South, and how some of the most iconic American food.  Hot dogs, fries, and soda are not really American at all. Writing with passion, curiosity, and a desire to share his knowledge, he includes recipes, secret addresses for fun and tasty finds, and tips on how to eat like a local from coast to coast. Part travelogue, part fun fact book, part serious culinary journalism, Richman's America the Edible illuminates the food map in a way nobody has before""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now, you can do better than that! You can actually make what they eat in your own kitchen! And while you're waiting for your delicious (hah!) space food to cook, you can read about the history of the space program, space food preparation methods, and even get to know many of the astronauts that have dined in space. Did they find the food appetizing? What did they miss most when they were in space? How has NASA try to improve the food over the years? Charles Bourland is a retired long-time director of the NASA space food program, and Gregory Vogt, also a former NASA education specialist, helped train the astronauts. Both veterans of the U.S. space program have combined here to provide authentic recipes not only of foods that were actually served during various space missions (including Skylab, Apollo, the space shuttle, and the International Space Station) but also some of the astronauts' favorite recipes and even space recipes from famous TV chefs Rachael Ray and Emeril Lagasse! You will be amused and amazed at the information you find here. And you will be ready to impress your friends and family with your new culinary skills. Finally, you will have a much better understanding of what it really is to live in space, for weeks or even months at a time. Any volunteers for a trip to Mars?

Food & Wine rising star chefs Greg Denton and Gabrielle Quiñonez Denton have earned rave reviews and legions of fans for the wonderfully creative, edgy, and surprisingly vegetarian-friendly wood-fired cooking at their acclaimed restaurant, Ox. Around the Fire translates their Argentine-by-way-of-Portland cooking into simple, flavorful, accessible recipes for the home cook. Grilling recipes are adapted for Weber grills and conventional barbecues, and feature unexpected, unfamiliar cuts of meat such as lamb shoulder, halibut tails, and bone-in fish steaks. An extensive section on grilled vegetable preparations--such as Grilled Artichoke with Espelette Mayo--will take summer barbecues to the next level, and chapters on starters, sides, and desserts are designed to perfectly accompany the grilled main dishes. The food is influenced by Argentine traditions but also showcases fresh, seasonal produce, and recipes for salads, ceviches, cocktails, and other grill accompaniments make this much more than a meat book.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

At Sk©Œrtoft, there is a belief in organic, small-scale-produced whole grains, traditional stone-ground milling techniques, use of wild fermented sourdough, organic yeast, and attention to terroir. Their farm produces some of the highest-quality, nutrient-rich grain available. In fact, Copenhagen's celebrated restaurant NOMA, recently accorded a ""World's Best Restaurant"" award, uses Sk©Œrtoft M©ılle products. Indeed, the growing movement of Nordic cuisine centers on its devotion to high-quality regional produce, the creativity of the chef, and a sound awareness of the workings of nature. This set of principles also serves to guide Hanne Risgaard in Home Baked.Risgaard offers practical information not only on the concepts and processes behind creating delicious Scandinavian breads, but also concise growing and cultivation information about the grains themselves, as well as a guide to basic equipment and kitchen set-up, ingredients, and the history of Sk©Œrtoft and their philosophy.

There are instructions for everything, from best practices in kitchen design, to setting a table, and how to entertain.  There are hundreds of easy to use, well documented recipes, even some old recipes that were old when the book was originally published.  The War Time edition also has a handy portion in the back with substitutions for hard to find items that were being sent to the troops.  There is a French cookery section as well - I always wondered whether Julia Child may have been inspired by this very book.  The copy I have at home is my favorite and most used of the over 50 cookbooks I currently own - it has tape on the spine to keep it from getting any more damaged.

In The Dance Claimed Me, Peggy and Murray Schwartz, friends and colleagues of Primus, offer an intimate perspective on her life and explore her influences on American culture, dance, and education. They trace Primus's path from her childhood in Port of Spain, Trinidad, through her rise as an influential international dancer, an early member of the New Dance Group (whose motto was ""Dance is a weapon""), and a pioneer in dance anthropology. Primus traveled extensively in the United States, Europe, Israel, the Caribbean, and Africa, and she played an important role in presenting authentic African dance to American audiences. She engendered controversy in both her private and professional lives, marrying a white Jewish man during a time of segregation and challenging black intellectuals who opposed the ""primitive"" in her choreography. Her political protests and mixed-race tours in the South triggered an FBI investigation, even as she was celebrated by dance critics and by contemporaries like Langston Hughes. For The Dance Claimed Me, the Schwartzes interviewed more than a hundred of Primus's family members, friends, and_fellow artists,_as well as_other individuals to create a vivid portrayal of a life filled with passion, drama, determination, fearlessness, and brilliance""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When Burke's helicopter crashes and burns in Africa, he comes away with his life but loses his heart to the woman who saves him. That's when he decides it is time to stop dancing with the devil. But a bitter twist of fate puts an end to Burke's dreams, leaving him adrift in Dublin with bittersweet memories ... and no appetite for danger. But the devil isn't done with him yet. An ocean away, Jack Wilson leaves prison burning for revenge. Like Burke, Wilson has had something taken from him. And he, too, dreams of starting over. Only Wilson's dream is the rest of the world's nightmare. Driven by his obsession with a Native American visionary, and guided by the secret notebooks of Nikola Tesla, the man said to have ""invented the twentieth century,"" Wilson dreams of Apocalypse - and plans to make it happen ...

In this inspiring book, Dana Mills examines the political power of dance from a global perspective. Mills explores different dimensions of dance as a form of intervention into a politics more commonly articulated in words. She is interested in dance as a system of communication that allows its subjects to speak with their bodies and to create embodied spaces, drawing attention to the radically egalitarian nature of dance with its ability to transcend all boundaries of gender, race and sexual politics.  The book is structured around a range of cross-cultural and comparative examples, from the work of Isadora Duncan and Martha Graham to gumboot dancers in South Africa and the One Billion Rising movement, which uses dance to protest against gendered violence. Each case study references powerful dance ?moments?, providing links to YouTube clips to allow readers to experience dance directly as they read. The case studies are discussed within a conceptual framework drawing on Rancière?s concept of dissensus and in the light of recent work on embodied politics by political theorists including Jodi Dean and Jane Bennett.  Dance and politics is aimed at a dual audience of political theorists and students and scholars of dance and performance. It will also be of great interest to readers seeking to expand their thinking about politics, embodiment and activism.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In pieces for The SoHo Weekly News, Village Voice, The New York Times, and Dance Magazine, Perron limns the larger aesthetic and theoretical shifts in the dance world since the 1960s. She surveys a wide range of styles and genres, from downtown experimental performance to ballets at the Metropolitan Opera House. In opinion pieces, interviews, reviews, brief memoirs, blog posts, and contemplations on the choreographic process, she gives readers an up-close, personalized look at dancing as an art form. Dancers, choreographers, teachers, college dance students--and anyone interested in the intersection between dance and journalism--will find Perron's probing and insightful writings inspiring. Through the Eyes of a Dancer is a nuanced microcosm of dance's recent globalization and modernization that also provides an opportunity for new dancers to look back on the traditions and styles that preceded their own.

Cox|Language English|Pages 158,"Holt begins his discussion with a history of ""chorography"" and the work of famed eighteenth-century dancing masters and choreographers Guillaume-Louis Pecour, Pierre Beauchamps, and Raoul-Auger Feuillet. Several pages of dances written in the dance notation system devised by Feuillet are included. Holt's ""reconstruction"" of the pavan includes the appropriate music from Thoinot Arbeau's 1588 manual, Orchesographie. For decades, the inclusion of the notation and music was deceiving to many unsuspecting people who used Holt's manual to reconstruct dances for the Renaissance and Baroque. Holt's interpretations bear no resemblance to the originals; however, they do clearly illuminate the romanticized aura that began to surround such dances as the minuet during the nineteenth century. Line drawings and photographs enhance Holt's manual.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The manual provides an extensive history of dance from the Greeks and Romans to the courts of Italy and France to the dances of aboriginal American Indians. Demonstrating the centuryʼs growing interest in physical education, Reilley provides a detailed section on exercise. The manual gives descriptions of the popular ballroom dances of the era--quadrilles, waltz, schottisch, and polka.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Orsino|Language Italian,"This manual represents one of the most important sources on dance technique for the second half of the eighteenth century and is a critical link between Baroque dance and early romantic ballet. Part one is divided into sixty sections describing various aspects of dance beginning with a statement on the utility of dance, and feet positions. The manual continues with descriptions of many steps, for example, four types of battemens, nine types of pas de bourrée, balloté, fouetté, and twenty-three types of cabriole. Also included is extensive information on late eighteenth-century grotesque style, especially important for the study of Italian pantomime. Part two discusses the responsibilities of a dancing master and manner of performing the minuet. The manual concludes with instructions for thirty-nine contradanze (contredanses), including one dance that is arranged for thirty-two performers.

Unlike other contemporary writers, Ferrero devotes more than eighty pages to the origins of dance and a history of European and Native American dance. The remaining part of the manual concerns ballroom etiquette and descriptions of numerous dances including the quadrille, waltz, polka, schottisch, varsovienne, polka mazurka, and galop. Ferrero gives directions for more than eighty figures of the cotillon, a group dance performed as a series of party games. Some of the figures include ""The scarf,"" ""The glass of wine,"" ""The sea during a storm,"" ""The four chairs,"" and ""The rounds thwarted.""

Originally published in 1808, the manual was reissued in 1822, and another version appeared in 1815 under the title The complete system of English country dancing.

Chapters cover a range of topics that explore dance film, contemporary dance with film on stage, dance as an ideal medium to be captured by 3D images and videodance as kin to site-specific choreography. This book explores the ways in which early practitioners such as Löie Fuller and Maya Deren began a conversation between media that has continued to evolve and yet still retains certain unanswered questions. Methodology for this conversation includes dance historical approaches as well as mechanical considerations. The camera is a partner, a disembodied portion of self that looks in order to reflect on, to mirror, or to presage movement. This conversation includes issues of sexuality, race, and mixed ability. Bodies and lenses share equal billing.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By examining the development of modern dance in the USA during the inter-war period she develops a framework for analysing dance from a sociological perspective. In applying her approach to the work of St Denis, Ted Shawn, and Martha Graham, among others, she relates the emergence of modern dance to contemporaneous artistic developments, and locates dance within a wider social and economic context. Thus, she draws attention to the importance of popular culture in the development of modern dance, music and painting, and the crucial role women played in establishing dance as an art form. By way of exemplification, she looks at the work of Yvonne Rainer in order to demonstrate how this sociological approach might be applied to a post-modern work.  Dance, Modernity and Culture explores an area of art practice that has long been marginalised by sociologists of art. As an important contribution to dance scholarship this book will be essential reading for all those interested in the performing arts.

""Dancing in Blackness is a professional dancer's personal journey over four decades, across three continents and twenty-three countries, and through defining moments in the story of black dance in America. In this memoir, Halifu Osumare reflects on what blackness and dance have meant to her life and international career. Osumare's story begins in 1960s San Francisco amid the Black Arts Movement, black militancy, and hippie counterculture. It was there that she chose dance as her own revolutionary statement. She moved to Europe, where she taught ""jazz ballet"" and established her own dance company in Copenhagen. Returning to the United States, she danced with the Rod Rodgers Dance Company in New York City and played key roles in integrating black dance programs into mainstream programming at the Lincoln Center. After dance fieldwork in Ghana, Osumare returned to California and helped develop Oakland's black dance scene. Along the way, she collaborated with major artistic movers and shakers: among them, Katherine Dunham, Pearl Primus, Jean-Léon Destiné, and Donald McKayle. Now a black studies scholar, Osumare uses her extraordinary experiences to reveal the overlooked ways that dance has been a vital tool in the black struggle for recognition, justice, and self-empowerment. This is the inspiring story of an accomplished dance artist and a world-renowned dance scholar who has boldly developed and proclaimed her identity as a black woman."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Early training establishes neuromuscular patterns that form the foundation of later technique. If the training is sound, the young student may become a graceful dancer who is challenged to extend technical skills further and further.This second edition, published in 1992, incorporates kinesiology, biomechanics and physiology into the theories of ballet. Paskevska places the technical explanations within the spirit of the art form. The book contains material on the progression of training, which it uses to illustrate the possibilities and limitations of the body while cultivating balanced self-awareness for dance students and performing artists.Chapters include: Introduction: A Personal Statement; Physical Requirements; Posture and Placement; Progression of Training; Sequence of a Ballet Class; Barre Work; Positions; Port de Bras and Arabesques; Weight Transference and Jumps; Principles of Turning; Pointe Work; Style; Classical and Modern Dance.

While many writers noted that the Bible contains numerous references to dance, Rice (1807-1877) points out that, in a biblical context, dance was utilized as a part of worship, performed exclusively by women dancing with each other. (The dangers of contact between the sexes while dancing were a common theme in antidance literature.) The second point, also common in antidance books, centered on the notion that dancing was bad for the health, especially in women.

The last two essays were written especially for this volume while the first eight essays were collected from speeches, statements and articles Hawkins has written. The essays are framed by a foreword written by Alan Kriegsman.Essay titles are: The Rite in Theatre; Theatre Structure for a New Dance Poetry; Modern Dance as a Voyage of Discovery; Questions and Answers; The Body is a Clear Place; My Love Affair with Music; Inmost Heaven, or The Normative Ideal; Dance as a Metaphor of Existence; The Principle of a Thing; Art in Its Second Function.Accompanying the text is a photo section illuminating Hawkins' work as a dancer and choreographer from his early years on. He has created an aesthetic of movement based on the notions that art can exist both for its own sake and as a means towards deeper enlightenment; that dance is a metaphor for existence; that all body movement contributes to the moment-to-moment wonder of living. Philosopher, experienced performer and pithy observer of the American modern dance scene, this elder spokesman for modern dance-who Anna Kisselgoff calls ""the poet of modern dance""-challenges us to revolutionize our responses to movement and dance.

Lady of the dance,Marie Duffy,dance,First published in 2017,/works/OL32365999W,/authors/OL11744351A/Marie_Duffy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  The O'Brien Press|Language English|Pages 272,"Marie Duffy is the undisputed queen of Irish dancing: she has trained more world champions than any other teacher, and has been Michael Flatley's right-hand woman for twenty years. She works tirelessly to promote Irish dance and culture internationally. In this honest and entertaining book, Marie gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the world of professional Irish dance, and draws back the curtain on her own fascinating and inspiring life. Marie first gained recognition dancing on entertainment shows in the 1960s, and went on to become a hugely successful Irish dancing teacher. Watching the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest in her living room, Marie was filled with pride as she'd taught many of the dancers in the famous Riverdance interval act. Two years later, Marie received a phone call that transformed her life when Michael Flatley offered her a job on a new show he had devised. Lord of the Dance would go on to become a worldwide hit, beginning years of fruitful collaboration between Marie and Flatley. Sadly however, Marie's professional highs have been accompanied by many personal lows, including the loss of her mother (who didn't live to see her daughter's success) and first husband Ian, and being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Marie had a mastectomy, but in the showbiz tradition of 'the show must go on' she went back to her work rehearsing the dance troupe.

Volume two describes the renaissance of the arts and the origins of ballet to 1610. Volume three focuses on dance in the court of Henri IV and the establishment of French opera. Cahusac borrows heavily from other writers, especially Philippe Quinault. Although by twentieth-century scholastic standards, Cahusac's interpretations may be problematic, the work formed the foundation for much of the writing on dance history until the twentieth century.

Both works, which were among De Keersmaeker's most successful premieres, are known for their energetic, virtuosic dancing and formal richness. They also feature minimalist scores by composer Steve Reich, costumes by famed designer Dries Van Noten, and striking scenic design. In this publication, fascinating interviews with De Keersmaeker by Bojana Cvejic reveal the choreographic principles behind the pieces and give insight into De Keersmaeker's process. These conversations are illustrated with numerous primary source materials, including drawings, photographs, and documents related to productions of 'Drumming' and 'Rain'. A series of three DVDs contain extensive interviews and voice-over commentaries by De Keersmaeker and Cvejic, illustrated by demonstrations and excerpts of the performances. With its unique multimedia presentation of these two canonical dance pieces, this volume is an essential resource on one of today's most prominent choreographers.  A conversation in which Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker offers the performance theorist and musicologis Bojana Cvejić wide-ranging insights into choreography, and into the making of Druming and Rain, two landmark works created to the music of minimalist composer Steve Reich.

The manual also covers popular culture, peasant dance, and ""foreign dance."" The perspective of this manual is clearly nineteenth century, with little emphasis on historical fact. The point of view is clearly western, and this is evident in the music examples that accompany almost every country or culture's entry--all have been subjected to western notation and are arranged in late nineteenth-century grand musical style. Additionally, the text includes numerous illustrations and, no matter the country or culture, the figures are physically shaped to look like late nineteenth-century western ladies and gentlemen.

Reading Against the Orientalist Grain: Performance and Politics Entwined with a Buddhist Strain,Syed Jamil Ahmed,dance,First published in 2008,/works/OL9148351W,/authors/OL3228522A/Syed_Jamil_Ahmed,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22867251M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Anderson India|Pages 357,"Reading Against the Orientalist Grain: Performance and Politics Entwined with a Buddhist Strain is exploratory and self-questioning, crystallized around the post-colonial location of the author. From this location, the phrase ‘against the grain’ connotes a bit of wry humour. The grain in wood, if planed in the wrong direction, will tear rather than lie smoothly. And that precisely is the intention of this volume. Recognizing 'politics' as a pervasive struggle for power and the ‘political’ as that which seeks to expose, subvert or enhance transactions of power, this volume is unashamedly political on two fronts: Orientalism’s ‘natural’ tendency for dealing with the ‘Orient’ and the hegemony of culture mobilized in ‘benign’ and ‘exotic’ ‘Oriental’ performances.  Reading Against the Orientalist Grain, as a study of performances, intends to read, i.e., to make sense of, to construct meaning out of eight performances. These are Caryā Nṛtya and Indra Jātrā from Nepal, Pangtoed Cham from Sikkim, Lhamo from Tibet, Paro Tsechu from Bhutan, Devol Maduva from Sri Lanka, Yoke Thay from Burma and Bauddha Kīrtan from Bangladesh. These performances are entwined with one common thread — Buddhism — more specifically, Theravāda and Vajrayāna Buddhism. The volume is the product of and an attempt to communicate the author’s experience of Buddhism as transience — ironically, in the past tense of these pages — against the Orientalist grain. It seeks to examine how various representations of ‘Buddhist’ performances, as networks of signs where the signified is infinitely delayed, are constructed and to what effects and consequences these representations are mobilized.

The work borrows heavily from previously published materials for sections on primitive and ancient dances. As with other authors of this era, ""modern dances"" are considered to be the pavane, gavot, rigodon, and minuet. In keeping with a renewed interest in the reconstruction of Renaissance and Baroque dances, the manual includes a chapter, ""Revival of Popular Old Dances.""

Voiart's manual is devoted to the history of dance. Quoting heavily from many previously published materials, including a number of travelogues, this book discusses the origins of dance and devotes a chapter each to Greek and Roman dance. The second part of the book discusses transition to what the author terms ""modern dance,"" in this case the court dances of France. In examining the dances of the French Baroque court, Mme. Voiart (1786-1866) refers to a great variety of dances including the courante, minuet, and gavotte as well as dances from at least one hundred years earlier such as the pavane and branle. Demonstrating an interest in non-European dance, the book also discusses dance as practiced in other parts of the world including Norway, Canada, the Sioux of Missouri, and Africa. Although the scholarship, by contemporary standards, is seriously flawed, the book is part of the large body of literature that has influenced the writing of dance history for more than one hundred years.

I have taken countless lessons and classes, passed a professional certification exam, done several shows and a competition--yes, dressed in those outrageous gowns and false eyelashes--and then gone back home to the kids, the soccer, the housework, and to work the next day. It hasn't been easy to make room in the schedule for my passion, but I have done it, because I'm certain now that it is necessary for life. This new period is rich--as rich in some ways as having my two children because it has been a kind of birth--but it has also been extraordinarily painful thanks to the self-examination that dancing has provoked in me. And so, because of dance, I can say, unequivocally and gratefully, that I am alive at last.""  -- From Quick, Before the Music Stops""There is no time for regret in dance. You have only now, this moment, for your performance, your glorious movement. Whatever you're going to do, do it now, quick, before the music stops."" -- Janet CarlsonIn her twenties, Janet Carlson was a successful competitive ballroom dancer, but she abandoned dancing to raise a family and pursue a more conventional profession as an editor for a luxury lifestyle magazine. Twenty years later, she seemed to have it all: two beautiful daughters, a glamorous job, and a handsome, talented husband. Despite all of her successes, she felt a terrible void - her marriage was deeply troubled, and she was somehow withdrawn in the very midst of her own life and the lives of her children. Then, one Valentine's Day, her husband gave her ballroom dancing lessons as a gift, and everything changed. She discovered the joy, passion, and confidence she hadn't realized had gone missing for so long. Over time, Janet discovers that ballroom dancing also contains the secrets to life and love: the give-and-take of dance, two bodies in rhythm and harmony, mirrors the reciprocity of human relationships. Total trust between partners is as vital on the dance floor as it is within a marriage. And yet, both partners - in dance and in life - must stand on their own two feet.The unadulterated joy Janet feels as she intuitively moves to the music speaks to the kind of absolute, whole-body happiness we were born to have. On the dance floor,she finds resolve in the waltz, self-confidence in the tango, and passion in nearly everything. Embracing dance once more allows her to let go of a marriage that was completely out of sync; put more heart and emotion into her work; find more time to truly be with her children; and ultimately rejoice in her intrinsic balance and poise.Told with precision, grace, and painstaking honesty, Quick, Before the Music Stops is the tale of one woman's midlife renewal through dance, and how her newfound empowerment transcends the dance floor and becomes immediate and relevant in every aspect of her life. It shows us how to recognize and celebrate both our strengths and our flaws, reignite passion for the everyday, and how to step from the periphery into the light and surrender to the music.

Most dance arises from an interaction between music and movement. Tap is both dancing to music and dancing as music. We don't just watch it; we hear its rhythms and feel them in our muscles and bones. Like jazz, tap was born in the United States. It's a hybrid of traditional African dances brought over by slaves and jig, clog, and other folk-dance forms from the British Isles. Brian Seibert's magisterial history illuminates tap's complex origins and its theatricalization in blackface minstrelsy. He charts tap's growth in the vaudeville circuits and nightclubs of the early twentieth century, chronicles its spread to ubiquity on Broadway and in Hollywood, analyzes its post-World War II decline, and celebrates its reinvention by new generations of American and international performers. It is a story with a huge cast of characters, from Master Juba (whose performance Charles Dickens described) through Bill Robinson and Shirley Temple, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, to Gregory Hines and Savion Glover. Seibert traces the stylistic development of tap while guiding us through the often surprising history of cultural exchange between black and white over centuries. What the Eye Hears is a central account of American popular culture, as well as the saga of African Americans in show business, wielding enormous influence as they grapple with the pain and pride of a complicated legacy""--  ""The first authoritative history of tap-dancing one of the great art forms originated in America""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

University Press|Language English|Pages 282,"Dance in Sri Lanka stands at the heart of the rituals formerly performed for the welfare of the kingdom. In traditional Sinhala society the occupational group of dancers was integrated into a feudal system in which services to the king and to the Buddhist temples were rewarded by giving rights to cultivate land. The roots of the Sinhala dance are to be found in the oldest surviving dance-cult of the country, the Kohomba Kankariya ritual, which was connected to the maintance of peace between descendants of aboriginal groups and the descendants of Indian invaders under Prince Vijaya. In the 20th century, however, modern stage dancing imerged: the Chitrasena school. This school broke away from caste barriers and gender roles, and accomplished the transformation of traditional dancing to a modern indigenous form of art.    The author, Marianne Nürnberger, has spent many years researching the material in this book and the results are both fascinating and scholarly.

"Rechtschaffener Tantzmeister, oder Gründliche Erklärung der frantzösischen Tantz-kunst ..",Gottfried Taubert,dance,First published in 1976,/works/OL7729853W,/authors/OL2394940A/Gottfried_Taubert,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1976|Publisher  Heimeran|Language German|Pages 1176,"Well, I studied this kind of old dancing very thoroughly and I know this book well. It was published 1717, in old German language. This old German is very different from modern German, even Germans can hardly understand it. Germany was still a developing country at that time and the language changed a lot. Secondly German books at that time have been printed in old German letters, called fractur (people call those letters sometimes gothic, but that's a wrong term).  The author Taubert was a dancing teacher of the early 18th century. He was morally very strict and expected his student to work hard. The most important dance in this book actually is the minuet, but this is not the only dance. But his standard is higher than just dancing for couples on a ball: Taubert goes further, he teaches how to dance the minuet even solo! That means, the basic minuet step isn't enough -- you have to add on other steps, maybe invent some on you own, to make it more interesting and artificial. Yet, this is not ballet, it was called gallant chamber dancing at that time.  In the first part of his book Taubert writes a lot about the public view on dancing at that time. Some people considered dancing sin, and Taubert tries to prove it wasn't. And because he explains a lot over hundreds of pages, you can learn a lot about common life during the baroque era. But frankly you have to study this old language to understand it. Modern German skills aren't enough.  To understand the second half of Taubert's huge book, is even tougher. I can read old German very well, it doesn't strain me at all. But I didn't get his explanations, how to dance his steps and movements technically though. I really had to frequent baroque dance classes for years. After a few years studying there, I decided to forget everything, and make Taubert my one and only teacher. His rules are really a very difficult philosophy/science -- you gotta be extremely obsessed in order to love that. LOL  I will probably write a lot about my experiences with dancing Taubert's stuff on my blog http://gallant-world.blogspot.com -- it is not commercial of course -- just one of those blogs in the 18th century blogspot scene, by bloggers who share their obsessions.  Why did I write this? Well, actually I was looking for a digitalized version of Taubert's book, I could link to from my blog. I have Taubert's book at home, but how can I show his pages to my readers? Then I read here comments of people who where quite a bit frustrated, because of lacking infos. Well, here there are. :)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Auf diese Weise erreicht der Tanz eine hohe Komplexität, extreme Geschwindigkeiten und einen kontinuierlichen Fluss. Diese Qualitäten sprechen das Körperwissen des Zuschauers an, der das Geschehen mit Hilfe seines Bewegungssinnes mitvollzieht. So wird deutlich, wie wesentlich und prägend die körperlichen Kompetenzen des Zuschauers für seine Wahrnehmung der bewegten Körper ist. Die Studie betrachtet tänzerische Körperbewegung, ohne diese in Bedeutungen stillzustellen. Vielmehr hebt sie ihren Eigensinn und ihre Prozesshaftigkeit hervor und arbeitet die aus der Tanzpraxis stammenden Begriffe »Bewegungssinn« und »Bewegungslogik« wissenschaftlich aus.

Auf den Spuren einer der berühmtesten modernen Tänzerinnen nähert sich die Studie einem lange vernachlässigten Thema der Tanzgeschichte und der frühen sowjetischen Kulturgeschichte: den Ursprüngen des totalitären Projekts zur Formung des menschlichen Körpers.

Auf diese Weise entstehen Choreographien, die weniger auf der reinen Tanzbewegung aufbauen als vielmehr auf Relationen zwischen Körperbewegung, Stimme, Videobild, Kostüm und Raumanordnung. Die Unterteilung der Bühne, die Gleichzeitigkeit und das Nebeneinander von unabhängigen Momenten, die Bewegung auf der Stelle heben die Linearität des Verlaufs auf. Die Choreographien entgrenzen sich in Richtung Bewegungs- und Sprachstudie, Installation und Tableau vivant. Die Studie betrachtet diese Merkmale erstmals unter dem Gesichtspunkt eines erweiterten Bildbegriffs. Dabei werden Themen wie die Projektion, die Blicklenkung, die Pose, der Affekt und die Duration ausgearbeitet. Die Frage nach Bildqualitäten in der Ordnung von Bewegung und Choreographie geht über die Fokussierung auf Meg Stuart hinaus und liefert einen wichtigen Beitrag für die Bild- und Kunstwissenschaft.

Waltzing Through Europe,Egil Bakka,dance,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501605W,/authors/OL4991727A/Egil_Bakka,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  Open Book Publishers|Pages 494,"""From ‘folk devils’ to ballroom dancers, Waltzing Through Europe explores the changing reception of fashionable couple dances in Europe from the eighteenth century onwards.  A refreshing intervention in dance studies, this book brings together elements of historiography, cultural memory, folklore, and dance across comparatively narrow but markedly heterogeneous localities. Rooted in investigations of often newly discovered primary sources, the essays afford many opportunities to compare sociocultural and political reactions to the arrival and practice of popular rotating couple dances, such as the Waltz and the Polka. Leading contributors provide a transnational and affective lens onto strikingly diverse topics, ranging from the evolution of romantic couple dances in Croatia, and Strauss’s visits to Hamburg and Altona in the 1830s, to dance as a tool of cultural preservation and expression in twentieth-century Finland.  Waltzing Through Europe creates openings for fresh collaborations in dance historiography and cultural history across fields and genres. It is essential reading for researchers of dance in central and northern Europe, while also appealing to the general reader who wants to learn more about the vibrant histories of these familiar dance forms.  Discourses We Live By approaches these questions through narrative research, in a process that uses words, images, activities or artefacts to ask people – either individually or collectively within social groupings – to examine, discuss, portray or otherwise make public their place in the world, their sense of belonging to (and identity within) the physical and cultural space they inhabit.  This book is a rich and multifaceted collection of twenty-eight chapters that use varied lenses to examine the discourses that shape people’s lives. The contributors are themselves from many backgrounds – different academic disciplines within the humanities and social sciences, diverse professional practices and a range of countries and cultures. They represent a broad spectrum of age, status and outlook, and variously apply their research methods – but share a common interest in people, their lives, thoughts and actions. Gathering such eclectic experiences as those of student-teachers in Kenya, a released prisoner in Denmark, academics in Colombia, a group of migrants learning English, and gambling addiction support-workers in Italy, alongside more mainstream educational themes, the book presents a fascinating array of insights.  Discourses We Live By will be essential reading for adult educators and practitioners, those involved with educational and professional practice, narrative researchers, and many sociologists. It will appeal to all who want to know how narratives shape the way we live and the way we talk about our lives.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The ecstasy of being,Joseph Campbell,dance,First published in 2017,/works/OL19742934W,/authors/OL350149A/Joseph_Campbell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 242,"Dance was one of mythologist Joseph Campbell's wide-ranging passions. His wife, Jean Erdman, was a leading figure in modern dance who worked with Martha Graham and had Merce Cunningham in her first company. When Campbell retired from teaching in 1972, he and Erdman formed the Theater of the Open Eye, where for nearly fifteen years they presented a wide array of dance and theater productions, lectures, and performance pieces. The Ecstasy of Being brings together seven of Campbell's previously uncollected articles on dance, along with ""Mythology and Form in the Performing and Visual Arts,"" the treatise that he was working on when he died, published here for the first time. In this new collection Campbell explores the rise of modern art and dance in the twentieth century; delves into the work and philosophy of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and others; and, as always, probes the idea of art as ""the funnel through which spirit is poured into life."" This book offers the reader an accessible, yet profound and provocative, insight into Campbell's lifelong fascination with the relationship of myth to aesthetic form and human psychology.

Dinner & party,Rose Prince,cooking,First published in 2015,/works/OL19750366W,/authors/OL1448777A/Rose_Prince,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 277,"""Whether you're a beginner looking for simple, impressive recipes to feed friends and family, or a seasoned host hoping to inject your repertoire with stylish, interesting ideas, you'll find all you need in Dinner & Party. Rose's stance on entertaining is that the cook shouldn't be banished to the kitchen; cooking for guests needn't be fussy or hard to juggle, but instead made up of dishes - some classics, some novel - that can be prepared in advance, dressed up to impress last minute and enjoyed by everyone. Practicality is central to a book updating the etiquette for entertaining in our times. With this in mind, Part 1: Dinner showcases easy options for every course, all alongside thoughtful advice about how to source ingredients, when to begin preparation and how to serve. Meanwhile, Part 2: Party provides tried and tested catering ideas for larger groups, from indoor picnics, to standing parties and Christmas dinners. With sample menus, including an innovative guide to putting the right dishes together through the seasons, this is the friendly, practical guide to making entertaining easy in the 21st century, bringing everyone together."" -- Provided by publisher.

Tucked behind a gas station off California's legendary Highway 1, the Big Sur Bakery is easy to miss. But don't be fooled by its unassuming location—stumbling across the Bakery, as countless visitors have done on their way up and down the Pacific Coast, will make you feel as if you've discovered a secret: a gem of a restaurant where the food, people, and atmosphere meld together in a perfect embodiment of the spirit of Big Sur. The three restaurant owners, chef Philip Wojtowicz, baker Michelle Wojtowicz, and host Michael Gilson, escaped the Los Angeles food scene to create their version of the ideal restaurant, nestled in the heart of some of the most beautiful country in the world. This is simple, wood-fired American cooking at its best, executed in a way that lets the ingredients—seasonal and often locally produced—shine. Weekend brunches feature thick, nine-grain pancakes and savory breakfast pizza topped with crisp bacon, fresh herbs, and pasture-raised eggs. At night, Phil offers classics like Grilled Prime Rib Steak with Red Wine Sauce along with twists on traditional favorites like Venison Osso Buco or Rockfish Scampi. And every meal should end with one of Michelle's great desserts, whether it's a homemade Peppermint Ice Cream Sundae or Hazelnut Flan with Roasted Cherries. But this is more than a cookbook; it's a yearlong glimpse into what it's really like to live in Big Sur, introducing the people and places that make the restaurant's renowned food possible, including Wayne Hyland, hunter and forager, Jamie Collins, organic row cropper, and Gary Pisoni, the eccentric vintner who supplies some of the restaurant's most beloved wine. With its outstanding photography, lively profiles, and dozens of must-make recipes, this book helps bring the experience of Big Sur home.

Exotic Tastes of Sri Lanka,Suharshini Seneviratne,cooking,First published in 2003,/works/OL8546303W,/authors/OL2863614A/Suharshini_Seneviratne,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL8095978M-M.jpg,"Publish Date August 15, 2003|Publisher  Hippocrene Books|Language English|Pages 228","The breathtaking island of Sri Lanka lies in the Indian Ocean, separated from southeastern India by a mere 30-mile chain of shoals. This proximity to India has had an inevitable effect on Sri Lanka's cuisine, as did the successive Portuguese, Dutch, and British occupations. However, over the centuries the majority of these dishes have been modified to suit the local palate. Exotic Tastes of Sri Lanka highlights the gamut of flavors of this cuisine, which runs from hot and spicy to comforting and mild.  The chapters of Exotic Tastes of Sri Lanka are devoted to short eats (appetizers), salads, staples, vegetarian dishes, poultry, meat and egg recipes, seafood preparations, desserts, and sweetmeats (treats). An array of exotic ingredients that is key and integral to Sri Lankan cuisine enhances the dishes. For instance, gambooge, with its uniquely sour flavor, is often used in traditional seafood preparations like Fish Ambul Thiyal, while either grated coconut or coconut milk intensify most recipes, including Pumpkin Kalu Pol Curry. Local staples are delectable works of art, such as exquisite Stringhoppers, Hoppers, and Pittu.  Since the entrées revolve around the nation's favorite ingredient, rice, the loosely coined term ""rice and curry"" best describes Sri Lankan cuisine. Other staple ingredients include coconut (milk, oil, grated), as well as aromatic herbs and spices such as curry leaves, mint, coriander and fennel seeds, and cloves. Sri Lanka offers a particularly impressive repertoire of vegetarian and seafood preparations.

Berries reintroduces us to these delightful fruits, including neglected varieties that have nearly disappeared from the American diet and garden. Roger Yepsen, author/illustrator of Apples, offers advice on finding wild berries, growing your own, and preserving them for year-round enjoyment. His gallery of sixty delicate watercolors depict berries from black currants and wild strawberries to the exotic salmonberry and Achilles Red gooseberry. And while it's hard to improve on the fresh item, Berries includes almost a hundred recipes: blueberry buckle, raspberry soup, elderberry wine, and black currant crepes.

In Fuss-Free Vegan, Sam Turnbull shows you that ""vegan"" does not equal unappetizing dishes, complicated steps, ingredients you have never heard of, or even food that tastes healthy. Instead, she gives you drool-worthy yet utterly fuss-free recipes that will bring everyone together at the table, vegans and non-vegans alike, in a chorus of rave reviews. This is the cookbook Sam wishes she had when she went vegan: one that recreates and veganizes the dishes she loved most in her pre-vegan days, like fluffy pancakes and crispy bacon, cheesy jalapeño poppers and pizza pockets, creamy Caesar salad and macaroni and cheese, rich chocolate brownies and holiday-worthy pumpkin pie, to name just a few. (And there's no hummus recipe in sight.)

If there is a frontier beyond organic, local, and seasonal, beyond farmers' markets and sustainably raised meat, it surely includes hunting, fishing, and foraging your own food. A lifelong angler and forager who became a hunter late in life, Hank Shaw has chronicled his passion for hunting and gathering in his widely read blog, Hunter Angler Gardener Cook, which has developed an avid following among outdoor people and foodies alike. Hank is dedicated to finding a place on the table for the myriad overlooked and underutilized wild foods that are there for the taking--if you know how to get them. In Hunt, Gather, Cook, he shares his experiences both in the field and the kitchen, as well as his extensive knowledge of North America's edible flora and fauna. With the fresh, clever prose that brings so many readers to his blog, Hank provides a user-friendly, food-oriented introduction to tracking down everything from sassafras to striped bass to snowshoe hares. He then provides innovative ways to prepare wild foods that go far beyond typical campfire cuisine: homemade root beer, cured wild boar loin, boneless tempura shad, Sardinian hare stew--even pasta made with handmade acorn flour. For anyone ready to take a more active role in determining what they feed themselves and their families, Hunt, Gather, Cook offers an entertaining and delicious introduction to harvesting the bounty of wild foods to be found in every part of the country""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Trends like Japanese Matcha in our lattes, Korean kimchi in our burgers and Thai Sriracha hot sauce on - well everything -prove that our love-in with Asian cuisine is thriving. Tokyo is now considered a food-forward city, currently boasting 15 three Michelin-starred restaurants (compared to France's 10). Over the past 20 years there has been a surge in celebrated French patisserie chefs moving to Japan to open fine patisseries. The art of French patisserie appeals very much to the Japanese culture - both share values of beauty, precision and care within cooking. This book features 60 recipes, from reinvented classics to stunning Patisserie creations made achievable to the home-cook. The chapters will be broken into Small Cakes & Individual Patisserie, which will include Lemon & Yuzu Eclairs. Sweet Tarts will offer delights such as Miso Butterscotch Tarts and the Large Cakes & Gateaux section offers celebration cakes like a Matcha & Pistachio Opera. In the Desserts section find dinner party classics with Japanese twists such as White Sesame & Adzuki Cheesecake. The Cookies & Confectionery chapter is full of fun treats like Sesame Peanut Butter Cookies and a Green Tea Kit Kat. To finish, some mouth-watering savoury recipes such as Panko Doughnuts stuffed with Pork Katsu. A flavour matrix will helpfully map key characteristics of Japanese ingredients.

In Classic German Baking, blogger and author Luisa Weiss--who was born in Berlin to an Italian mother and American father, and married into a family of bakers with roots in Saxony--has collected and mastered the recipes most essential to every good baker's repertoire.

Alana Chernila hears this sort of question all the time. Arugula, celeriac, kohlrabi, fennel, asparagus--whatever the vegetable may be, people always ask how to prepare it so that the produce really shines. Although there are countless ways to eat our vegetables, there are a few perfect ways to make each vegetable sing. With more than 100 versatile recipes, Eating from the Ground Up teaches you how to showcase the unique flavor and texture of each vegetable, truly bringing out the best in every root and leaf. The answers lie in smart techniques and a light touch. Here are dishes so simple and quick that they feel more intuitive than following a typical recipe; soups for year-round that are packed with nourishment; ideas for maximizing summer produce; hearty fall and winter foods that are all about comfort; impressive dishes fit for a party; and tips like knowing there's not one vegetable that doesn't perk up with a sprinkle of salt. No matter the vegetable, the central lesson is: don't mess with a good thing.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

But before opting for Botox injections, laser treatments, and harsh chemical peels, try a healthier approach. Susan Ciminelli, skin-care expert to the stars and owner of the New York City day spa that bears her name, believes that the skin is a mirror of one's internal environment. The right lotions and creams are just one piece of the puzzle: What you put into your body, and, most important, the foods you eat play vital roles in your skin's health and appearance.The Ciminelli Solution approaches skin care from the inside out, combining recipes, exercise tips, and treatment suggestions in a seven-day program that brings the mind, body, and soul into balance, resulting in flawless skin. Susan's step-by-step, day-by-day cleansing program is designed to jump start a healthier way of living and eating, without deprivation. This isn't a strict, clinical regimen. Instead, Susan takes the spa approach, focusing on what you should give to your body, not what you think you should take away.Susan shows how eating certain foods gives skin renewed vitality, beauty, and longevity, and explains what to eat -- and what foods to avoid -- to achieve a healthy, glowing complexion. In addition to flavorful recipes for dishes such as Wild Salmon Burgers, Herb-Roasted Chicken, and her famous Adzuki Bean Soup, Susan includes recipes for facial masks, scrubs, and peels using all-natural ingredients, like honey, pineapple, and olive oil.The Ciminelli Solution will improve your quality of life by detoxifying your system, increasing energy, and ultimately giving you a radiant, glowing complexion.

He has reviewed restaurants in almost every Communist country (China, Vietnam, Cuba, East Germany) and has recklessly indulged his enduring passion for eight-course dinners (plus cheese). All of this attests to his herculean constitution, and to his dedication to food writing.In Fork It Over, the eight-time winner of the James Beard Award retraces decades of culinary adventuring. In one episode, he reviews a Chicago restaurant owned and operated by Louis Farrakhan (not known to be a fan of Jewish restaurant critics) and completes the assignment by sneaking into services at the Nation of Islam mosque, where no whites are allowed. In Cuba, he defies government regulations by interviewing starving political dissidents, and then he rewards himself with a lobster lunch at the most expensive restaurant in Havana. He chiffonades his way to a failing grade at the Paul Bocuse school in Lyon, politely endures Sharon Stone's notions of fine dining, and explains why you can't get a good meal in Boston, spurred on by the reckless passion for food that made him ""the only soldier he knows who gained weight while in Vietnam"" and carried him from his neighborhood burger joint to Le Bernardin.Alan Richman, once described as the ""Indiana Jones of food writers,"" has won more major awards than any other food writer alive, including a National Magazine Award, eight James Beard Awards for restaurant reviewing, and two James Beard M.F.K. Fisher distinguished writing awards.The all new cover will emphasize Richman's globetrotting persona and attract a wide audience   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Good cooking,Marjorie Heseltine,cooking,First published in 1936,/works/OL10636283W,/authors/OL4429046A/Marjorie_Heseltine,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1936|Publisher  Houghton Mifflin|Language English,"It is a second edition, the first being published in 1933. It is a blue covered hard back book containing 561 pages. It covers meal planning, shopping for food, using the recipes, a complete range of recipes for the home cook, a short section on home canned foods, preserving and jelly making and on tools for the kitchen. Due to the era it was written and printed all recipes are from ""scratch"" and most recipes are just good dishes without the elaborate exotic dishes some cook books today contain. Every recipe I have tried from this book has been very good and all are fairly easy to complete. The book describes many things to help the new cook, such as how to tell the quality of meat. I especially enjoyed the 17 page section on sauces and stuffings. Though many recipes are brief, they are complete and sufficient. This book is becoming very difficult to find and is fairly expensive if it is in very good or better condition. This is a great cook book and I would love to see it in free e-book format so everyone could enjoy it.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whether you prefer yours fried, broiled, grilled, or smoked, you'll find here a mullet recipe to suit your every whim.

In addition, you get a wealth of insight on the health benefits of mullet, on the history and economics of the mullet trade, and on where to get a good cast net to catch your own ""Mr. Mugil"" or what to look for if you haul in your fish at the local supermarket.

However, you don’t have to live in Florida to enjoy these delicious meals. The recipes are straightforward and easy to follow, making it possible for even beginners to create gourmet meals. The authors even created complete regional Florida menus, including “A Florida Thanksgiving,” “Boating Picnic,” “Football Tailgate Party,” “Miami High Life,” and “Key West Fiesta.”  A chapter on Florida ingredients introduces readers to items that appear throughout the book. The authors also provide handy tips in recipes that require working with possibly unfamiliar ingredients (learn how to peel and seed a mango, for example, or safely handle habanero peppers). The book is divided into sections on drinks, appetizers, salads, soups, sandwiches, entrées, sides, breakfast specialties, sweet things, and condiments, making it easy to find your favorites in no time. And the recipes yield out-of-this-world results. Some hard-to-resist examples include jubilant orange creams; crabby stuffed mushrooms; papaya, tomato, and cilantro salad; oyster stew; Key West pork tenderloin; fried green tomatoes; fancy blue crab quiche; and Southern-style pecan pralines. Enjoy the Florida bounty!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It can be used to replace egg whites in many sweet and savoury recipes. Its unique mix of starches, proteins, fibre and sugars, which are left in the water after cooking, gives aquafaba a wide range of emulsifying, foaming, binding and thickening properties, making it the perfect ingredient in vegan cooking or recipes for those who have egg allergies. It's amazing to think that this precious liquid that we all threw down the sink could have such incredible properties? This is a real culinary revolution. The authors give all the secrets of aquafaba; how to make your own at home with just chickpeas and water and then how to use it in a dazzling array of recipes. Aquafaba beaten with a whisk produces a mountain of snowy white, giving volume to your muffins, and binding in your pasta. At last for vegans, lemon meringue pie, mousses, mayonnaise, macaroons and meringues are on the menu. And have Sebastien and Laura have thought of everything.

She doesn't think of eating homemade, from scratch meals as part of a trend or movement; it has always been her life. Raised in a family of farmers, bakers, chefs, gardeners, and publishers, Maria is used to growing, cooking, reading and writing about, and eating organic, delicious food. And now, for the first time ever, she's sharing her tried-and-true family recipes. Scratch is full of comfort food recipes that aren't focused on any one healthy trend, but are instead innately healthy, because Maria inspires you to return to your kitchen and cook with real, organic food. Recipes like Pasta Fagiole, Maria's Fried Chicken, and Lamb & Barley Soup will be crowd pleasers for sure, but Maria throws in some unique-to-the-family recipes that are going to delight as well, such as her Pennsylvania Dutch Dandelion Salad with Bacon Dressing, Ardie's Pasties, and Homemade Hoppin' John (a black-eyed pea stew made with smoked turkey or ham). Besides sharing her family's favorite recipes, Maria's book also gives you a peek into her life as a Rodale, with personal family portraits and stories. With this cookbook, you can eat like the Rodale family every night of the week with delicious food to make at home, from scratch. Naturally healthy, bacon included.  Rodale shows you how to get to the essence of good food-- cooking from scratch. It's easier than you thought, and even if you don't use organic, homegrown ingredients you'll still be losing many of the preservatives and artificial ingredients from canned and dried foods.

Powerhouse experts Arne Astrup, Professor Jennie Brand-Miller, and Christian Bitz know that the Nordic Diet is the ""best diet in the world"" for getting healthy and staying lean, even into middle age and beyond. As leaders in obesity research, glycemic science, and healthy living, respectively, they've learned that eating a specific ratio of proteins, whole grains, and vegetables and incorporating traditional Nordic ingredients such as rye flour, skyr yogurt, and rapeseed oil into one's diet are the most effective paths to overall health and stable weight. There's complex science at work behind the Nordic Diet, yet it's remarkably simple and delicious to adopt. Readers will be able to see significant improvements in their health and weight--and even prevent the dreaded middle-age spread--without ever having to count a single calorie or eliminate carbs, dairy, and meat. Featuring an in-depth look at peer-reviewed studies that support the diet and more than 60 stunningly photographed recipes, The Nordic Way is the health-forward cookbook that readers need to get and stay healthy for life""--  ""Based on the practically perfect Nordic Diet, this gimmick-free and scientifically proven approach to eating will help you keep unwanted pounds off for good""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Adapting recipes meant for a different-size cooker doesn't work--getting the right level of spice in your Vietnamese soup or keeping pulled pork tender requires having ingredients in the right proportion. But now, Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough have decoded slow cookers, and each of their recipes includes ingredient proportions for 2-3 quart, 4-5 quart, and 6-8 quart machines, guaranteeing a perfect fit no matter what machine you own. Each recipe is labeled for its level of difficulty and nutritional value, and they cover every kind of dish imaginable: delicious breakfast oatmeals, slow-braised meats, succulent vegetables, sweet jams and savory sauces, decadent desserts. This is the slow cooker book to end them all.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nourishment is nurture. That's what Andie learned from her grandmother and what she's always believed about cooking. But somehow, since marrying Ross, she's allowed her love of food to take a back seat and given up her dream of becoming a chef. Lately she's been craving more. And when her marriage falls apart, she's determined to find herself again and take back control of her destiny. The first step is taking a job in the kitchen of renowned chef Dominic Gerou. The brooding Englishman is more than Andie bargains for, but the new Andie is ready for anything, even a bad-tempered chef who makes it clear he won't tolerate mistakes. In this beautiful new novel, Dianne Blacklock takes us on a sumptuous journey of the heart as Andie uncovers the secret ingredient for her new life, and shows that no matter how many false starts you may have, if you hold on to your passion and your dreams, anything is possible.

Through his short animated films, his sculptures, installations, charcoal drawings on paper - based on a technique of erasure - as well as through his activities in theater as set designer and director, Kentridge explores the nature of memory and emotions, the ambiguity and complexity of social conflicts in the age of globalization.

The second part focuses on positions of the feet and bows and courtesies, and provides exercises for the feet and legs. The third and fourth parts discuss the quadrille and provide many figures; the fifth part is devoted to round dances such as the waltz, polka, schottisch, galop, and polka mazurka.

For the film adaptation, see No Blade of Grass (film).    The Death Of Grass  Cover of a U.S paperback edition.    Author(s)   John Christopher    Country United Kingdom    Language    English    Genre(s)    Science fiction novel    Publisher   Michael Joseph    Publication date    1956 (UK)    Media type  Print (Hardcover)    Pages   231 pp    ISBN    0140013008    OCLC Number 16191150  The Death of Grass (aka No Blade of Grass) is a 1956 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel written by the English author John Christopher, the first in a series of post-apocalyptic novels written by him. It deals with the concept of a virus that kills off all forms of grass.    The novel was written ""in a matter of weeks"" and liberated Christopher (a pen name for Samuel Youd) from his day job. It was retitled No Blade of Grass for the US edition as supposedly the US publisher thought the original title ""sounded like something out of a gardening catalogue"". The film rights were sold to MGM.[1]    [edit]Plot summary  A new virus strain has infected rice crops in East Asia causing massive famine; soon a mutation appears which infects the staple crops of West Asia and Europe such as wheat and barley, all of them types of grasses (thus the novel's title), threatening a famine engulfing the whole of the Old World, while Australasia and the Americas attempt to impose rigorous quarantine to keep the virus out.    The novel follows the struggles of architect John Custance and his friend, civil servant Roger Buckley, as, along with their families, they make their way across an England which is rapidly descending into anarchy, hoping to reach the safety of John's brother's potato farm in an isolated Westmorland valley. Picking up a travelling companion in a gun shop owner named Pirrie, they find they must sacrifice many of their morals in order to stay alive. At one point, when their food supply runs out, they kill an innocent family simply to take their bread. The protagonist justifies this with the belief that ""it was them or us.""    Adaptations  A film version, No Blade of Grass, was produced and directed by Cornel Wilde, and released in 1970.    In 2009, as part of a BBC Radio 4 science fiction season, the station broadcast a drama in five episodes, based on the novel and narrated by David Mitchell.[2]   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To former private investigator Quinn O'Casey, it's a simple case of death by misadventure. But when his brother Doug, a Miami-Dade patrolman, asks for help, he can't refuse. Especially when he learns that Lara and Doug—a student at the Moonlight Sonata dance studio where Lara occasionally taught—were having an affair. And despite Quinn's lack of interest in the case and even less in dancing, experience has taught him not to count on the obvious when it comes to murder. Going undercover as a dance student, Quinn meets studio manager Shannon Mackay, a beautiful, graceful woman who has left world-class competition to teach. He also uncovers some disturbing facts. Everyone there had a reason to hate Lara Trudeau, a woman as ruthless as she was talented. As a drama of broken hearts, shattered dreams and tangled motives unfolds, Quinn begins looking for a killer.In a city where pleasure drugs are a fast and dangerous high, Quinn is alarmed by the growing number of deaths due to overdoses, illegal substances and execution-style shootings connected to the Moonlight Sonata. Shannon, too, has begun to wonder if strange events surrounding the studio have a deeper source. She suspects she's being followed. Worse, she fears someone may be trying to kill her.Shannon is about to discover the risks she is willing to take to fight for what she wants—to dance, to compete again, to share her life with Quinn. Yet someone has another plan for her, a dangerous shadow figure made all the more deadly by wearing the face of a friend. But someone just hadn't counted on Quinn O'Casey—a man who doesn't give up and never backs down, especially when it comes to protecting the woman he loves.

The book is the text of four lectures delivered by Martin at the New School for Social Research in New York City (1931-1932) on the dance form as a philosophic perspective.Certain common principles underlie the many systems and methods of modern dancing, and these texts endeavor to discover a full explanation of the modern dance. The distinguishing characteristics—what it is made of and how it differs from other types of dance—form the starting point.Martin discusses the dance form as a philosophic perspective, considering (among other topics) the basic experience of physical movement, the effectiveness of beauty in form, metakinesis, vertical and horizontal rhythms and divergent approaches to art. The content is organized in four parts: Characteristics of the Modern Dance; Form; Technique; The Dance and the Other Arts.   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Unlike countless self-help books that tell us how and what we need to change to become happy, The Dance is an invitation to embrace our true selves. To dance, alone or with others, is to slow down and realize that who we are is enough. Once we stop striving to be someone else, we will be able to live with passion, energy, and honesty -- and truly experience the dance.

Through interviews and ethnographic, multi-sited research in Havana and several European cities, the author draws on the notion of ‘entangled mobilities’ to show how the intimate gendered and ethnicized moves on the dance floor relate to the cross-border mobility of salsa dance professionals and their students. A combination of research on migration and mobility with studies of music and dance, Entangled Mobilities in the Transnational Salsa Circuit contributes to the fields of transnationalism, mobility and dance studies, thus providing a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of gendered and racialized transnational phenomena. As such it will appeal to scholars across the social sciences with interests in migration, cultural studies and gender studies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, frameworks have been established and guidance made available for keeping dances, performances, and choreographers' legacies alive so that the dancers of today and tomorrow can experience and learn from the dances and dancers of the past. In this volume, a range of voices address the issue of dance preservation through memory, artistic choice, interpretation, imagery and notation, as well as looking at relevant archives, legal structures, documentation and artefacts. The intertwining of dance preservation and creativity is a core theme discussed throughout this text, pointing to the essential continuity of dance history and dance innovation.

But when she first placed her hands on the barre at an after-school community center, no one expected the undersized, anxious thirteen-year-old to become a groundbreaking ballerina. When she discovered ballet, Misty was living in a shabby motel room, struggling with her five siblings for a place to sleep on the floor. A true prodigy, she was dancing en pointe within three months of taking her first dance class and performing professionally in just over a year: a feat unheard of for any classical dancer. But when Misty became caught between the control and comfort she found in the world of ballet and the harsh realities of her own life (culminating in a highly publicized custody battle), she had to choose to embrace both her identity and her dreams, and find the courage to be one of a kind. Life in Motion is an insider's look at the cutthroat world of professional ballet, as well as a moving story of passion and grace for anyone who has dared to dream of a different life""--Publisher description.

Her theories of movement, based upon the principles of Fall and Recovery, are no less well-known by reputation than by their pervasive influence. This 1978 publication was the first documentation in book format of her movement theories, presented and analyzed by a first-generation disciple.The book teaches more than sixty exercises, geared to the beginning and intermediate student through the means of written description and illustration. The historical and philosophical background of the technique is discussed and descriptions of Humphrey's dance compositions are used as case studies of the exercises.The Dance Technique of Doris Humphrey is divided into three parts: The Background of the Technique reveals how the theory evolved, inspired by the writings of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; The Technique as Practice contains chapters on center, floor and barre work, as well as spatial sequences; The Creative Potential of the Technique describes how the three basic ingredients of dance movement-rhythm, dynamic and design-can be used to create dances. There is also an Epilogue, which analyzes the choreographic concepts underlying four of Humphrey's most well-known dance works: Air for the G String, La Valse, Two Ecstatic Themes and Passacaglia.

As she takes in the magnificent energy and brassy sounds of her youth, the past comes to life, along with the fateful decision all those years ago that forced her to choose between personal conviction and social expectation, between the two men who had captured her heart. It had been a time of great music and love, but also of war and sacrifice, and now, trying to make peace with her memories, Lorraine must find the courage to face buried secrets. In the process, she will rediscover herself, her passion, and her capacity for resilience. Set during the 1940s and the present and inspired by a real-life ballroom, Stars Over Clear Lake is a moving story of forbidden love, lost love, everlasting love--and self love.""--  ""Mesmerizing and romantic, Stars Over Clear Lake transports readers to the Surf Ballroom, where musical acts became legends in the 1940s and which holds the key to one woman's deepest secret. Lorraine Kindred's most cherished memories are of the Surf Ballroom, the place where youth lost themselves to the brassy sounds and magnetic energy of the big band swing, where boys spent their last nights before shipping off to war--and where Lorraine herself was swept away by a star-crossed romance. Returning to the ballroom for the first time in decades, Lorraine enters a dazzling world she thought long vanished. But as the sparkling past comes to life, so does the fateful encounter that forced her to choose between her heart and her duty all those years ago--and Lorraine must face the secret she's buried ever since. Along the way, she'll rediscover herself, her passion, and her capacity for resilience. Set during the 1940s and the present and inspired by a real-life ballroom, Loretta Ellsworth's Stars Over Clear Lake is a moving story of forbidden love, lost love, everlasting love--and self love""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Underlining the transcultural potential of the genre, she discusses in particular their individual body-mind practices and so-called butō techniques in order to produce a generalised account of butō training. Her argument is underpinned by complex field research which she carried out as an expert observer and a workshop participant. Drawing on a transdisciplinary approach, which combines insights and findings from the fields of cultural and performance studies, cultural anthropology and cognitive sciences, the book depicts the sequence of three phases which make up the processual structure of butō training: intro, following and embodiment.

Terry Gross has included an original introduction to each entry in ALL I DID WAS ASK, providing the historical and artistic context for the conversation and introducing the subject to the reader. And while the interviews are all with famous, household names, Gross’s probing, thoughtful interview style allows for content that goes beyond the typical superficial banter exchanged on most talk shows. Terry Gross’s trademark meticulous research lets her link ideas and experience in ways that help even the most reticent guest relax and to open up for interviews that are more informative and more revelatory than those from other shows.While Terry Gross often has politicians and political journalists on her show, the book features contributors to popular culture whose stories are less ephemeral. She has edited down thousands of interviews to feature the classics, the interviews with lasting relevance and interest for readers and those interviews that transcend the radio medium, with such interviewees as Aerosmith, Conan O’Brien, Dustin Hoffman, John Updike, and Chuck Close.

Her questions, about the nature of our experience of dance and the nature of dance as a formed and performed art, are still provocative and acutely significant today. Sheets-Johnstone considers dance as an aesthetic mode of expression, and integrates theories of dance into philosophical discussions of the nature of movement. Back in print after nearly 20 years, The Phenomenology of Dance provides an informed approach to teaching dance and to dance education, appreciation, criticism, and choreography. In addition to the foreword by Merce Cunningham from the original edition, and the preface from the second edition, this fiftieth anniversary edition includes an in-depth introduction that critically and constructively addresses present-day scholarship on movement and dance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These questions and their answers are the subjects around which Margaret Lloyd has written a unique and endlessly entertaining book.Originally published in 1949, The Borzoi Book of Modern Dance captures the beginnings of modern dance history fresh from its inception. Margaret Lloyd creates a detailed, witty and insightful overview of the art form in its early stages. The book is organized by individuals and then branches into documentation of important subcategories of dance (subsidizing; humanizing dance; forms of documentation).The seminal choreographers, teachers and dance groups of the first half of the twentieth century are all included: Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman, Helen Tamiris, Hanya Holm, The New Dance Group, Jose Limon, Anna Sokolow, Esther Junger, Sybil Shearer, Katherine Dunham, Valerie Bettis, Pearl Primus, Lester Horton and Eleanor King.Lloyd describes the importance of each of these individuals through personal anecdotes, performance recounts and creative analysis. When there is a story, Lloyd tells it. When a choreographic invention or effect is important, she describes it.The Borzoi Book of Modern Dance deals with a range of aspects of the art form to show that modern dance is a question of attitude, a way of expression, social perceptions and sociological thrusts. It is the personality of modern dance, captured in words. Includes 49 illustrations.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The work contains much of the same information found in numerous other historiographies of the era. The author considers the birth of stage dancing to be Kate Vaughan's ""Skirt Dance."" Another opinion expressed by St. Johnston is the erroneous notion that the quadrille was one of the dances that directly followed the minuet. As was common during this era, the author maintains a strict western bias with chapter titles such as ""Quaint Dances in Civilized Countries.""

It is a storytelling art passed on from teacher to student. A ballerina dancing today is a link in a long chain of dancers stretching back to sixteenth-century Italy and France: Her graceful movements recall a lost world of courts, kings, and aristocracy, but her steps are also marked by the dramatic changes in dance and culture that followed. From ballet's origins in the Renaissance and the codification of its basic steps and positions under France's Louis XIV (himself an avid dancer), the art form wound its way through the courts of Europe, from Paris and Milan to Vienna and St. Petersburg. Jennifer Homans, a historian and critic who was also a professional dancer, traces the evolution of technique, choreography, and performance in clear prose, drawing readers into the intricacies of the art with vivid descriptions of dances and the artists who made them.

The book combines historiography and ethnography with movement analysis using a set of analytical tools compiled and tailored from distinct disciplines. As such, Cristina F. Rosa creates a 'toolbox' to map, more specifically, the presence of this polycentric and polyrhythmic system across distinct and specific realms: samba-de-roda (samba-in-a-circle) dances, capoeira angola games, and the repertoire of Grupo Corpo, a contemporary dance company based in Belo Horizonte (MG). This fascinating book examines how ginga functions at the bodily level, the multiple roles it assumes in each of these realms, and the effects that it mobilizes through choreographed and/or improvised movements, gestures, and intentions. It is an important resource for all scholars and students of international dance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The biggest event in the island's history is coming up--an integrated dance featuring Duke Ellington. It's a daring idea for fifties-era Texas, and not everyone is happy about it.
