Franziska Martinsen erläutert aus radikaldemokratietheoretischer Perspektive, dass Menschenrechte erst dann, wenn sie weniger als humanitäre denn als originär politische Rechte verstanden werden, ihr ermächtigendes Potenzial weltweit entfalten können.

Fixing failed states,Ashraf Ghani,political_science,First published in 2009,/works/OL19668677W,/authors/OL6189105A/Ashraf_Ghani,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Oxford University Press USA|Language English|Pages 254,"Today between forty and sixty nations, home to more than one billion people, have either collapsed or are teetering on the brink of failure. The world's worst problems--terrorism, drugs and human trafficking, absolute poverty, ethnic conflict, disease, genocide--originate in such states, and the international community has devoted billions of dollars to solving the problem. Yet by and large the effort has not succeeded. Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart have taken an active part in the effort to save failed states for many years, serving as World Bank officials, as advisers to the UN, and as high-level participants in the new government of Afghanistan. In Fixing Failed States, they describe the issue--vividly and convincingly--offering an on-the-ground picture of why past efforts have not worked and advancing a groundbreaking new solution to this most pressing of global crises. For the paperback edition, they have added a new preface that addresses the continuing crisis in light of ongoing governance problems in weak states like Afghanistan and the global financial recession. As they explain, many of these countries already have the resources they need, if only we knew how to connect them to global knowledge and put them to work in the right way. Their state-building strategy, which assigns responsibility equally among the international community, national leaders, and citizens, maps out a clear path to political and economic stability. The authors provide a practical framework for achieving these ends, supporting their case with first-hand examples of struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal as well as the world's success stories--Singapore, Ireland, and even the American South.  The authors provide a practical framework, contrasting struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal with success stories like Singapore and Ireland.

A la proliferación de libros, artículos y nuevas revistas, en crecimiento exponencial, debe añadirse la pluralidad de ejes que vertebran la discusión contemporánea en este ámbito: el debate liberalismo-comunitarismo, el multiculturalismo y nacionalismo liberal, la reformulación del igualitarismo, la renovación del republicanismo, la democracia participativa y la deliberación, el posmodernismo y la crítica de los fundamentos, la teoría política de género, el pensamiento político verde etc. El riquísimo panorama que se configura deviene crecientemente inabarcable incluso para los especialistas pues, conjuntamente con la infinidad de argumentos en liza, cuatro décadas de intenso debate ?siempre sobre un trasfondo de siglos de historia del pensamiento político? han originado asimismo cambios, desplazamientos y reorientaciones de diverso alcance en la trayectoria de los principales participantes. Los casos de Foucault, Rawls, Walzer o Habermas, constituyen elocuente prueba de ello.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

How to run a government,Michael Barber,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL23437029W,/authors/OL5228567A/Michael_Barber,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Allen Lane, an imprint of Penguin Books|Language English|Pages 336","The secrets of successful government from Michael Barber, one of the world's leading experts on carrying out lasting improvements in public life. Billions of citizens around the world are frustrated with their governments. Political leaders struggle to honour their promises and officials find it near impossible to translate ideas into action. The result? High taxes, but poor outcomes. Cynicism not just with government but with the political process. Why is this? How could this vicious spiral be reversed? In this groundbreaking book Michael Barber draws on his wealth of experience of working for and with government leaders the world over to present a blueprint for how to run a government. Using contemporary cases from every continent and classic examples from history, he makes a compelling case for a new approach. From Downing Street to Punjab, Charles I to Churchill, this book shows that the solution is less about ideology and more about clear priorities and meticulous planning. Praise for Instruction to Deliver: ""Wonderful"". (Bill Bryson). ""One of the best books written on British government for many years"". (Vernon Bogdanor, Financial Times). Sir Michael Barber is the co-founder of Delivery Associates and Chief Education Advisor at Pearson. Over the last two decades he has worked on government and public service reform in more than 50 countries. From 2001 to 2005 he was the first Head of the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit in the UK. He is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Harvard School of Public Health and an Honorary Doctor of several universities including the University of Exeter. His previous books include Instruction to Deliver: Fighting to Transform Britain's Public Services.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Im Gegensatz zu den Elektrizitäts- und Gas-Versorgungsunternehmen in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland haben die Fernwärme-Versorgungsunternehmen jedoch keine wettbewerbsrechtliche Sonderstellung: Sie können keine rechtswirksamen wettbewerbsbeschränkenden Verträge im Sinne der 1, 15 und 18 des Gesetzes gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen (GWB) abschliessen, was den anderen Versorgungsunternehmen ausdrücklich erlaubt ist. Dafür unterliegt die Elektrizitäts- und Gaswirtschaft einer umfassenden Kontrolle aufgrund des Energiewirtschaftsgesetzes und einer Vielzahl anderer Gesetze und Verordnungen. Ausserdem gilt für diese - zusätzlich zur allgemeinen Missbrauchsaufsicht im Rahmen des GWB - eine spezielle Missbrauchsaufsicht nach den 103-105 GWB. Diese unterschiedliche Rechtsstellung der Elektrizitäts- und Gaswirtschaft einerseits und der Fernwärmewirtschaft andererseits ist erklärungsbedürftig.

Belarus - on the road to nationhood or back to a merger with Russia?,Carl Haselbach,political_science,First published in 1997,/works/OL16613157W?edition=ia%3Abelarusonroadton00hase,/authors/OL7117143A/Carl_Haselbach,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25295361M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 1997|Publisher  Naval Postgraduate School,              Available from National Technical Information Service|Language English|Pages 133","This thesis, a single case study, focuses on the manner in which Belarus handles the sovereignty that it acquired during the implosion of the Soviet Union. Various Belarusian factors likely to generate or to foster national identity and state independence are examined. None of them (ethno- cultural patterns, institutions and politics, attitudes of the Belarusian people) gives reason for optimism. Belarusian national identity is poorly developed and unable to serve as a formative factor in nation-building. In addition, Belarus shows a high economic dependence on Russia. Thus, the country pursues a course of close alignment with its former overseer. Belarus and Russia have initiated an integration process, the real aims of which are unclear. Bilateral treaties remain largely unimplemented, while the countries' leaders make contradictory statements about the possibility of a Belarusian-Russian unification. For Russia, this inconsistency reflects a lack of consensus on the issue within the government and among the various political factions. In the absence of an agreed-upon foreign policy in the 'near abroad', Russian nostalgia for Slavic unity and the loss of the Empire further complicates the debate. Hence, the future of a sovereign Belarus or the form of a Belarusian-Russian political alignment is still to be decided.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Liberales: Compromiso cívico con la virtud,José María Lassalle,political_science,First published in 2010,/works/OL16282598W,/authors/OL5602322A/José_María_Lassalle,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25101236M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Debate|Language Spanish|Pages 413,"Una brillante explicación de qué significa ser liberal a través de la evolución histórica del término. Fue en Inglaterra donde apareció por vez primera un individualismo virtuoso comprometido con la defensa pública de la libertad frente a la amenaza del absolutismo. Allí surgió un discurso político liberal-republicano que defendió que el bien público y el interés privado fueran de la mano. Así, el liberalismo nació como un discurso público y privado de la virtud individual que tenía la vocación de frenar cualquier arrogancia despótica. Pero en la segunda mitad del siglo XX una tendencia neoliberal y libertaria convirtió el mercado en una abstracción dogmática que justificaba un egoísmo descontrolado y sin límites.  En Liberales, José María Lassalle expone la necesidad de que el liberalismo del siglo XXI vuelva a los principios virtuosos de sus padres fundadores, John Locke, Adam Smith y Edmund Burke. Los liberales tienen por delante la responsabilidad de enfrentarse a sus propios fantasmas y liderar nuevamente la defensa de una política del deber, y no del beneficio. Una política al servicio de la libertad: preocupada por el c ontrol del poder; que asegure el establecimiento de mecanismos institucionales que impidan la corrupción y las conspiraciones contra el mercado que se urden a las sombras de los gobiernos; que combata el dogmatismo y que defiende la tolerancia como una seña de identidad de nuestra cultura. Ante la mayor crisis de las últimas décadas, urge recuperar la virtud y los valores, una tarea para la que los liberales están mejor capacitados que nadie.

The distinctively liberal response to this challenge insists that the state should as far as possible avoid relying on such contested issues in its basic structure and deliberations. David McCabe critically surveys influential defenses of the liberal solution and advocates modus vivendi liberalism as an alternative defense of the liberal state. Acknowledging that the modus vivendi approach does not provide the deep moral consensus that many liberals demand, he defends the liberal state as an acceptable compromise among citizens who will continue to see it as less than ideal. His book will interest a wide range of readers in political philosophy and political theory""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Recently, however, there has been a rise of authoritarian politics in many countries. Concepts of post-democracy, anti-politics, and the like are gaining currency in theoretical and political debate. Now that capitalist democracies are facing seismic and systemic challenges, it becomes increasingly important to investigate not only the inherent antagonism between liberalism and the democratic process, but also socialism. Is socialism an enemy of democracy? Could socialism develop, expand, even enhance democracy? While this volume seeks a reappraisal of existing liberal democracy today, its main goal is to help lay the foundation for new visions and practices in developing a real socialist democracy. Amid the contradictions of neoliberal capitalism today, the responsibility to sort out the relationship between socialism and democracy has never been greater. No revival of socialist politics in the twenty-first century can occur without founding new democratic institutions and practices""--Amazon.com   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The world we live in, molded by science and historical relativism, may be described as hostile to human dignity or perfection, or abhorrent to those who love the search for wisdom. Straussian teaching consisted in the steady effort to reopen ""the quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns,"" and refers to the esoteric way of writing practiced by the most profound thinkers of the past which has been apparently forgotten in the last three centuries. Strauss binds the concept of natural right with the question of maintenance of conditions for philosophizing, and it probably seems to him that such defense of philosophy is the highest task in our times. However, one must be well aware that philosophizing always means a perilous way of life. Indeed, it may be destructive of the city (polis) itself as far as the city exists due to some crucial beliefs the philosopher might put in doubt. Reflecting on those issues, Strauss engaged in several highly important debates with his contemporaries, in an open way with, e.g., Carl Schmitt, Karl Lw̲ith and Alexandre Kojv̈e, and more tacitly with Martin Heidegger""--Provided by publisher.

Bush, political fundraising was considered an afterthought. Their campaigns spent $192 million--combined! In contrast, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney spent over $7 billion to beat one another in 2012--36 times more than that spent just 20 years before. How is it that politics has become so focused on the almighty dollar and the cost of political campaigns so expensive? Lindsay Mark Lewis is arguably the person best able to answer those questions--the notorious political fundraiser renowned for his willingness to do almost anything to get the next political dollar in the war chest. He was part of the new political mob responsible for the excessive influence of money on campaigns. Co-authored with writer and political analyst Jim Arkedis, Political Mercenaries is a fascinating look into how American politics, to contradict former Speaker Tip O'Neill, is now all national money. This book emerges at a time when millions of Americans are more skeptical than ever about politicians on both sides of the aisle and how they obtain the money that funds their campaigns""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As such, it represents a long overdue return to the comparative tradition with its emphasis on subject-specific studies across the country. The chapters in this revised edition of Provinces, each of which has been written for the book by a leading scholar, are arranged according to four major sections?political life, institutions, public administration, and public policy?making the book highly suitable for those interested in areas beyond provincial politics. At the same time, the adopted comparative approach reveals a wealth of insight into Canadian politics at the beginning of the new millennium. This new edition covers some of the vital concerns of our time: a disquiet about the quality of democracy, concern about women?s place in provincial societies, interest in the nature and potential of governance in the north, unease on the question of the fiscal imbalance between all orders of government, a sensitivity to the needs of cities and communities, assessment of the retrenchment of the state, and consideration of the policy futures influenced by the changing demography of the provinces.""--Publisher's website.

All are public events of significant consequence for politicians and for the voting public. As we pay attention to scandal, we ignore more weighty matters and we over-estimate the bad behavior of our elected officials. Political scandals have tremendous consequence on citizenry and might possibly undermine democratic institutions. This volume brings together academics from different backgrounds to explore the impact and long-term effects of political scandals. What makes this book different from others is the wide spectrum of perspectives brought together to help analyze a singular subject""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
Political Augustinianism,Michael J. S.

In the twentieth century especially, Augustine has been pivotal to the development of modern and contemporary political and social construction. Schools of 'Augustinianism' proliferated, especially in French, German, and English, and debated critical questions around the relationship of the church and state, war, justice, ethics, virtue, and the life of citizenship, interpreted through a lens provided by Augustine. Political Augustinianism examines these modern political readings of Augustine, providing an extensive account of the pivotal French, British, and American strands of interpretation. Fr. Michael J.S. Bruno guides the reader through these modern strands of interpretation, examines their historical, theological, and socio-political context, and discusses the hermeneutical underpinnings of the modern discussion of Augustine's social and political thought.

With Bolshevism triumphant in Russia and public discontent shaking the United States, conservatives at every level of government and business created a network dedicated to sweeping away the 'spider web' of radicalism they saw threatening the nation. In this groundbreaking study, Nick Fischer shines a light on right-wing activities during the interwar period. Conservatives, eager to dispel communism's appeal to the working class, railed against a supposed Soviet-directed conspiracy composed of socialists, trade unions, peace and civil liberties groups, feminists, liberals, aliens, and Jews. Their rhetoric and power made for devastating weapons in their systematic war for control of the country against progressive causes. But, as Fischer shows, the term spider web far more accurately described the anticommunist movement than it did the makeup and operations of international communism. Fischer details how anticommunist myths and propaganda influenced mainstream politics in America, and how its ongoing efforts paved the way for the McCarthyite 1950s and augured the conservative backlash that would one day transform American politics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, the empirical analysis of three democratic rising and regional powers' understandings and practices of political sovereignty suggests otherwise. On the basis of empirical research in Brazil, India, and South Africa, this book presents a descriptive analysis of the transformation of sovereignty in non-western contexts since the end of the Cold War. The book argues that the processes of change are most accurately captured by a novel ideal-type of 'soft sovereignty'. Soft sovereignty takes into account today's complex multi-polar order in a post-western world.

Thus understanding the Venezuelan election of 2012 has proved to be challenging, with various recent studies focused upon it. Luis F.

Global energy governance in a multipolar world,Dries Lesage,political_science,First published in 2010,/works/OL18718986W?edition=ia%3Aglobalenergygove0000unse_m7j2,/authors/OL6705976A/Dries_Lesage,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23944511M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  Ashgate|Language English,"Multipolar governance permits a number of important states to have significantly more economic and political clout than others, but among them there is hardly any hierarchy. The new energy challenge, with its intricate socio-economic, ecological and international-political considerations, is a multi-dimensional, multi-level and multi-actor issue that requires a minimum of 'central' political steering, because neither the invisible hand of the market, nor unilateral or bilateral power politics are capable to bring about sustainable solutions.  Global Energy Governance in a Multipolar World investigates the relationship between the emergence of a multipolar world order and the enormous challenges of global energy governance that the world is facing in the 21st century. It reflects on fundamental questions such as how the main consuming countries can avoid conflict over scarce resources, how they will cooperate to bring about open energy markets, energy conservation and efficiency, and how they can promote renewable energy sources.  Reviews:  'This important book addresses a crucial issue that has been ignored for far too long – how to establish and implement international rules that facilitate energy security on a sustainable basis for all. It combines a thorough analysis of the world’s key energy governance institutions, the interests of key countries, and the past and potential roles for concerts of major powers such as the G8 with thought-provoking recommendations that deserve serious consideration by policy-makers around the world.'    Ann Florini, National University of Singapore, Singapore and The Brookings Institution, USA  '…a truly path breaking book on a subject of vital importance that shows a deep understanding of the increasingly multi-polar and interdependent world in which we live. Energy issues cannot be compartmentalized from other global issues and the authors grasp the reality that the world needs a ‘political steering committee’. They are right.

The debate about languages of instruction in Africa and Asia involves an analysis of both the historical thrust of national government and also development aid policies. Using case studies from Tanzania, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, Zehlia Babaci-Wilhite argues that the colonial legacy is perpetuated when global languages are promoted in education. The use of local languages in instruction not only offers an effective means to contextualize the curriculum and improve student comprehension, but also to achieve quality education and rights in education. Evidence that science literacy is better served through local languages and adapted to local contexts is put forward with a new vision for science learning that invests cutting edge technologies with local context. This vision is crucial to the African and Asian development on their own terms and should take its rightful place as a human right in education""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Boundary Struggles,,political_science,,/works/OL20931234W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Cappelen Damm Akademisk/NOASP (Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing)|Language English|Pages 326,"Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right and a core value in liberal democracies. It is also, however, one of our time?s most contested issues, constantly claimed to be either too wide-ranging, at the peril of vulnerable minority groups, or too limited, restricting dissent and democratic deliberation. Employing a sociological lens on the dynamics of the public sphere, this book investigates how the boundaries of free speech are contested and negotiated through social processes which silence certain groups and opinions while amplifying others. The book focuses on key topics in current free speech debates ? immigration, religion and culture. Drawing on population-representative survey data, media analysis and in-depth interviews, the authors paint a broad picture of how boundaries of free speech are defined and maintained, experienced and challenged, in the rapidly changing Norwegian public sphere.

Jahrhunderts nach Aussagen darüber, was Aufgabe des Staates sein soll. Dabei ordnet er diese Aussagen den großen Staatstheorien zu - der liberalen, der konservativen und der sozialistischen Staatstheorie sowie - als deutschen Sonderfall - der des ""Kathedersozialismus"" gegen Ende des Jahrhunderts. Er kommt dabei zu der Erkenntnis, dass die Frage nach der Staatstätigkeit damals bereits mit vergleichbaren Argumenten wie heute diskutiert wurde und dass die Entwicklung - auch innerhalb der theoretischen Strömungen selbst - hin zum aktiven, vorsorgenden Staat ging. Ergebnis dieser Entwicklung war nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg in Deutschland die Entscheidung für die ""Soziale Marktwirtschaft"".   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Se ha vuelto casi un leit motiv hablar de crisis, ocaso o más aún, del fin del Estado por la pérdida de poderes y funciones de los aparatos estatales. La descripción del Estado que predomina hoy es la de un Estado débil, que ha perdido irremediablemente su soberanía en medio de la sociedad compleja. No es la intención de este libro dar cuenta de cómo, con esas afirmaciones, se esconden posiciones antipolíticas o que pretenden desplazar o hacer compartir la decisión política con otros actores (sean éstos, el tercer sector, las empresas o la sociedad civil) que no responden a la lógica de la responsabilidad democrática de validar el ejercicio o la renovación del poder mediante elecciones periódicas libres.  Resulta evidente que la producción de resultados justifica la existencia de cualquier institución pero ¿cuáles deben ser los “productos” en una institución pública?; ¿cuáles son los resultados esperados de un Estado, la institución pública más compleja de la modernidad? En términos más sencillos: ¿qué puedo esperar de un Estado?; ¿por qué y para qué existe esta forma política propia de la modernidad? Una pregunta tan sencilla no suele sino encontrar respuestas complejas y elípticas y orientadas al modelo Estatal legitimado pero ese modelo ha cambiado (y mucho) en los últimos dos siglos.  Siendo el objetivo de esta publicación acercar los temas claves de la materia a los alumnos de grado, como parte del Programa Libros de Cátedra de la Editorial de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata, trataremos de exponer los problemas centrales de una forma directa sin que ello implique disminuir la necesaria profundidad de los diversos aspectos que debemos abordar. El lector más interesado podrá consultar la bibliografía citada, mucha de ella de libre disposición.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Mastering space: hegemony, territory and international political economy",John A. Agnew,political_science,First published in 1995,/works/OL2715082W?edition=ia%3Amasteringspacehe00agne,/authors/OL397241A/John_A._Agnew,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL1097624M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1995|Publisher  Routledge|Language English|Pages 260,"For over two hundred years the domination of some countries by others has been intrinsic to international relations, with national economic and political strength viewed as essential to a nation's survival and global position. Mastering Space identifies the essential features of this ""state-centredness"" and suggests an optimistic alternative more in keeping with the contemporary post-Cold War climate. Drawing on recent geopolitical thinking, the authors claim that the dynamism of the international political economy has been obscured through excessive attention on the state as an unchanging actor. Dealing with such topical issues as Japan's rise to economic dominance and America's perceived decline, as well as the global impact of continued geographical change, the book discusses the role of geographical organization in the global political economy, and the impact of increasing economic globalisation and political fragmentation in future international relations. The authors identify the present time as crucial to the global political economy, and explore the possibilities of moving the world from mastering space to real reciprocity between peoples and places.

Mid-twentieth-century capitalism has turned into global capitalism, and global capitalism - turbocharged, Web-based, and able to find and make almost anything just about anywhere - has turned into supercapitalism. But as Robert B. Reich makes clear in this eye-opening book, while supercapitalism is working wonderfully well to enlarge the economic pie, democracy - charged with caring for all citizens - is becoming less and less effective under its influence. Reich explains how widening inequalities of income and wealth, heightened job insecurity, and the spreading effects of global warming are the logical outcomes of supercapitalism. He shows us why companies, fighting harder than ever to maintain their competitive positions, have become even more deeply involved in politics; and how average citizens, seeking great deals and invested in the stock market to an unprecedented degree, are increasingly loath to stand by their values if it means biting the hands that feed them. He makes clear how the tools traditionally used to temper America's societal problems - fair taxation, well-funded public education, trade unions - have withered as supercapitalism has burgeoned. Reich sets out a clear course to a vibrant capitalism and a concurrent, equally vibrant democracy. He argues forcefully that the spheres of business and politics must be kept distinct. He calls for an end to the legal fiction that corporations are citizens, as well as the illusion that corporations can be ""socially responsible"" until laws define social needs. Reich explains why we must stop treating companies as if they were people - and must therefore abolish the corporate income tax and levy it on shareholders instead, hold individuals rather than corporations guilty of criminal conduct, and not expect companies to be ""patriotic."" For, as Reich says, only people can be citizens, and only citizens should be allowed to participate in democratic decision making.""--The Hardcover edition.

Covering fourteen countries and five continents, it demonstrates that lynching has neither been a uniquely American phenomenon, nor did it exclusively target racial and ethnic minorities. But what appears to be common to vigilantism and extralegal punishment around the globe is the ideology of popular justice, the idea that lynching represents a form of communal self-defense against crimes that are unchecked by the state. The multidisciplinary and multiregional approach of this volume will lay the groundwork for a more thorough understanding of mob violence and extralegal punishment in the United States and the world""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book provides an innovative theoretical and conceptual approach that challenges this view, demonstrating that international society can accommodate hierarchies between sovereign states.Synthesising the concept of international society with elements of Beck's 'risk society', Clapton explores a particular set of hierarchies in the post-Cold War era that are characterised by interventions conducted by Western states in non-Western territories to promote liberal democratic government. Exploring interventions along the European Union's periphery, in the South Pacific and in Iraq, Clapton argues that these interventions are essentially exercises in risk management, designed to promote liberalism and democracy as a means of managing globalized risks to the security of Western states, such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is now used frequently - and often incorrectly - by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power - the ability to coerce - grows out of a country's military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and policies.""  ""Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration's new national security strategy. But according to Joseph Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America's military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recuiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power. This is our guide.""--BOOK JACKET.   Read more Read less",29 Want to read|2 Currently reading|2 Have read

His project kicked off a half century of research that has expanded our knowledge of climate change. Despite more than fifty years of research, however, our global society has yet to find real solutions to the problem of global warming. Why? In Behind the Curve, Joshua Howe attempts to answer this question. He explores the history of global warming from its roots as a scientific curiosity to its place at the center of international environmental politics. The book follows the story of rising CO2--illustrated by the now famous Keeling Curve--through a number of historical contexts, highlighting the relationships among scientists, environmentalists, and politicians as those relationships changed over time. The nature of the problem itself, Howe explains, has privileged scientists as the primary spokespeople for the global climate. But while the ""science first"" forms of advocacy they developed to fight global warming produced more and better science, the primacy of science in global warming politics has failed to produce meaningful results. In fact, an often exclusive focus on science has left advocates for change vulnerable to political opposition and has limited much of the discussion to debates about the science itself. As a result, while we know much more about global warming than we did fifty years ago, CO2 continues to rise. In 1958, Keeling first measured CO2 at around 315 parts per million; by 2013, global CO2 had soared to 400 ppm. The problem is not getting better - it's getting worse. Behind the Curve offers a critical and levelheaded look at how we got here.Joshua P. Howe teaches history and environmental studies at Reed College.""Scientists have proven to be right about the causes of a warming planet, but they have failed to stop the warming. Stopping it involves politics and economics more than science, and in this important book Joshua Howe examines how scientists and environmentalists--although both live in intensely political worlds--have managed to get the science right and the politics wrong. This is not the usual story of heroes and villains. Howe tells a more nuanced story-- a tragedy--in which a somewhat naive faith in science rendered scientists politically impotent in a complicated world. Few books published this year will tell a more important story."" - Richard White, Margaret Byrne Professor of American History, Stanford""How shall we deal with climate change? That is not just an important topic but, from the standpoint of future generations, arguably the most important of all topics. Thorough and wide-ranging, this book puts the history of global warming policy in its full political and cultural context."" - Spencer Weart, author of The Discovery of Global Warming""Behind the Curve is a much-needed book on the history of climate science and politics stretching back to the immediate post-World War II period."" - Mark Carey, author of In the Shadow of Melting Glaciers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

"Coleridge and Kantian ideas in England, 1796-1817",Monika Class,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16769497W,/authors/OL7162625A/Monika_Class,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Bloomsbury|Language English,"""Author of Biographia Literaria (1817) and The Friend (1809-10,1812 and 1818), Samuel Taylor Coleridge was the central figure in the British transmission of German idealism in the nineteenth century. The advent of Immanuel Kant in Coleridge's thought is traditionally seen as the start of the poet's turn towards an internalized Romanticism. Demonstrating that Coleridge's discovery of Kant came at an earlier point than has been previously recognized, this book examines the historical roots of Coleridge's life-long preoccupation with Kant over a period of twenty years from the first extant Kant entry until the publication of his autobiography. Drawing on previously unpublished contemporary reviews of Kant and seeking socio-political meaning outside the literary canon in the English radical circles of the 1790s, Monika Class here establishes conceptual affinities between Coleridge's writings and that of Kant's earliest English mediators and in doing so revises Coleridge's allegedly non-political response to Kant""--  ""Examines the influence of Kant - and in particular the neglected influence of his moral and political philosophy - on the work of Coleridge""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However it can at times be hard to tell difference between the two. It can be especially hard to do so when the difference between 'pretend to be' and 'is' is obscured almost to a point beyond recognition. In the volume one, we analyze the mass production and use of counterfeit religious symbolism used for political purposes. In volume two of this book we focus more on the actual practical application of the symbolyzm within the context of state, nation and faith: the use of counterfeit religious symbolyzm to blur the essential distinction between 'what is a real danger to a nation' and 'what is not'""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Özerdem and Podder reject the pejorative notion of youth as a security threat, a notion that still pervades the literature and practice of peacebuilding. The main objective of this study is, therefore, to provide a new conceptualisation of youth as a harbinger of peace, whether at an international or local level.By adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that identifies key themes in the analysis of its two main case studies of Liberia and Mindanao in the Philippines, this study maps out the debate surrounding the role of youth in post-conflict environments and draws from a wide range of cross-cultural examples. The failure to recognise youths as political actors can result in their contribution to peacebuilding being ignored, wasted and, at best, under-utilised. In recognising their agency as legitimate political actors, Özerdem and Podder address the need for a comprehensive understanding of their valuable contribution to peacebuilding""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Student activism in Asia,Meredith L. Weiss,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16688415W,/authors/OL5227244A/Meredith_L._Weiss,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  University of Minnesota Press|Language English,"""Since World War II, students in East and Southeast Asia have led protest movements that toppled authoritarian regimes in countries such as Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand. Elsewhere in the region, student protests have shaken regimes until they were brutally suppressed--most famously in China's Tiananmen Square and in Burma. But despite their significance, these movements have received only a fraction of the notice that has been given to American and European student protests of the 1960s and 1970s. The first book in decades to redress this neglect, Student Activism in Asia tells the story of student protest movements across Asia.Taking an interdisciplinary, comparative approach, the contributors examine ten countries, focusing on those where student protests have been particularly fierce and consequential: China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Burma, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. They explore similarities and differences among student movements in these countries, paying special attention to the influence of four factors: higher education systems, students' collective identities, students' relationships with ruling regimes, and transnational flows of activist ideas and inspirations.The authors include leading specialists on student activism in each of the countries investigated. Together, these experts provide a rich picture of an important tradition of political protest that has ebbed and flowed but has left indelible marks on Asia's sociopolitical landscape.Contributors: Patricio N.

Buckley as the champion of conservative ideas in an age of liberal dominance, taking on the smartest adversaries he could find while singlehandedly reinventing the role of public intellectual in the network television era. When Firing Line premiered on American television in 1966, just two years after Barry Goldwater's devastating defeat, liberalism was ascendant. Though the left seemed to have decisively won the hearts and minds of the electorate, the show's creator and host, William F. Buckley--relishing his role as a public contrarian--made the case for conservative ideas, believing that his side would ultimately win because its arguments were better. As the founder of the right's flagship journal, National Review, Buckley spoke to likeminded readers. With Firing Line, he reached beyond conservative enclaves, engaging millions of Americans across the political spectrum. Each week on Firing Line, Buckley and his guests--the cream of America's intellectual class, such as Tom Wolfe, Noam Chomsky, Norman Mailer, Henry Kissinger, and Milton Friedman--debated the urgent issues of the day, bringing politics, culture, and economics into American living rooms as never before. Buckley himself was an exemplary host; he never appealed to emotion and prejudice; he engaged his guests with a unique and entertaining combination of principle, wit, fact, a truly fearsome vocabulary, and genuine affection for his adversaries. Drawing on archival material, interviews, and transcripts, Open to Debate provides a richly detailed portrait of this widely respected ideological warrior, showing him in action as never before. Much more than just the story of a television show, Hendershot's book provides a history of American public intellectual life from the 1960s through the 1980s--one of the most contentious eras in our history--and shows how Buckley led the way in drawing America to conservatism during those years""--  ""Few conservatives are as revered and admired as William F. Buckley. Buckley is best known for founding National Review, the flagship journal of the right. But his long-running talk show Firing Line was equally important, because it allowed him to reach beyond the conservative enclave and engage millions of mainstream Americans. When Firing Line premiered in 1966, only two years after Barry Goldwater's blow-out defeat in the 1964 presidential election, it seemed as if liberalism had decisively won. Buckley's liberal guests clearly thought so. Yet he gamely and serenely soldiered on in his role as a public contrarian, making the case for conservative ideas and assuming that his side would ultimately win because its arguments were better. In time he was proven correct. Buckley's show--challenging, exciting, and always unpredictable--engaged the most urgent issues of the day and paraded the cream of America's intellectual class across the screen. The guest list reads like a who's who of midcentury American liberalism-David Susskind, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, along with major conservative figures like Henry Kissinger and Milton Friedman. It was also responsible for inspiring several generations of conservatives""--  Includes primary source materials.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is, as such, always a matter of judgment. Courses of action are chosen at least in part because they are somehow thought to be - are adjudged - better than the alternatives, and this simple fact has given rise to a great deal of speculation about the ways in which we determine or judge the relative merits of proposed laws and policies. What exactly is good judgment in politics? What are the characteristics of people who judge especially well? How is good judgment acquired and how can we recognize it in others? Political Judgment: An Introduction, Peter Steinbergeraddresses such questions by considering a variety of important developments in the history of political thought: ancient, modern and contemporary. Focusing on the central issue of rationality in politics and, in particular, on the primarily Kantian distinction between ""determinate"" and ""reflective"" judgment, this book introduces readers to important and on-going debates about the idea of prudence or practical wisdom as it functions, or ought to function, in the realm of public affairs. It will be essential reading for students and scholars of political theory, the history of political thought, and political ethics."" --   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Typically, public justification is conceived of as a procedure of abstraction, which only aims to identify universally shareable reasons. This book shows that this widespread view should be resisted, on both epistemic and moral grounds. Rather, public reasoning is best understood as a process whereby different non-shareable reasons converge. This alternative justificatory model suggests rethinking issues, such as the depth of reasonable pluralism, the function of moral epistemology, the scope of public justification, and the relationship between Anglo-American philosophy and discourse theory. --Back cover.

The Mind That is Catholic,James V.

Schall is a treasure of the Catholic intellectual tradition. A prolific author and essayist, Schall readily connects with his readers on sundry topics from war to friendship, philosophy, politics, and to ordinary everyday living. In his newest work, The Mind That Is Catholic, he presents a retrospective collection of his academic and literary essays written in the past fifty years. In each essay, he exemplifies the Catholic mind at its best―seeing the whole, leaving nothing out.  The ""Catholic mind"" seeks to recognize a consistent and coherent relation between the solid things of reason and the definite facts of revelation. Its thought aims to understand how they belong together in a fruitful manner, each profiting from the other; each being what it is. The Catholic mind is not a confusion of disparate sources. It respects and makes distinctions. It sees where things separate. It is in fact delighted by what is.  This delightful book is not polemical, but contemplative in mood. Schall shares with readers a mind that is constantly struck by how things fit together when seen in full light. He brings to his work a lifetime of study in political philosophy, a wide-ranging discipline that, in many ways, is the most immediate context in which reason and revelation meet. The Mind That Is Catholic respects what can be known by faith alone. But it also considers what is known by faith to be itself intelligible to a mind actively thinking on political and philosophical things. The whole, at the risk of its own contradiction, does not exclude the intelligibility of what is revealed.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A picture emerges of two strong US alliances increasingly at odds with each other, and of Japan-South Korea relations newly troubled not only by intensifying national identities but also by divergent strategic calculations. This volume shows how vital this triangle is to understanding US policy in Asia by bringing to light the dynamics of triangularity in the shadow of China's rise and the North Korean threat""--  ""This book reconsiders what we thought we knew about the US-led alliance triangle with Japan and South Korea, integrating some of the best, up-to-date analysis from three countries.

Fear of a virus. Fear of death. Fear of losing our jobs, our democracy, our human connections, our health and our minds. It's also about how the government weaponised our fear against us – supposedly in our best interests – until we were one of the most frightened countries in the world.But why did the government deliberately frighten us? How has this affected us as individuals and as a country? Who is involved in the decision-making that affects our lives? How are behavioural science and nudge theory being used to subliminally manipulate us? How does the media leverage fear? What are the real risks to our wellbeing?Ahead of any official inquiry into the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Laura Dodsworth explores all these questions and more, in a nuanced and thought-provoking discussion of an extraordinary year in British life and politics. With stories from members of the general public who were impacted by fear, anxiety and isolation, and revealing interviews with psychologists, politicians, scientists, lawyers, Whitehall advisers and journalists, A State of Fear calls for a more hopeful, transparent and effective democracy.

As a result of his work with political prisoners in the late 1970s, the Argentinean military dictatorship arrested, tortured, and held him for more than a year. During that time, Amnesty International adopted him as a ""Prisoner of Conscience."" After his release, he moved to the United States and continued his lifelong fight for the rights of others, and the lessons he has gleaned over the decades can help us with our current struggles.  Here, he sets forth an authoritative and incisive examination of torture, detention, exile, armed conflict, and genocide, whose urgency is even greater in the wake of America's recent disastrous policies.

Written by two expert insiders in the field, this extensive examination surveys a wide range of diverse terrorist groups from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) to Al Qaeda. It shows how key trends and patterns in domestic and international terrorism such as suicide bombings require counter strategies and tactics including surveillance and reconnaissance.||Case studies of terrorist organizations in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Balkans, and the Caucasus, and profiles of terrorists like Khalid Sheikh Mohommad, alias Mokhtar (The Brain), who masterminded the Al Qaeda attack on 9/11, illustrate the growing network of groups and leaders harnessing the forces of globalization. Finally, the authors suggest lthat no single state can act effectively on its own to confront terrorism--instead, a wide range of strategies needs to be adopted by all.

"ACCESS: EFFECTS OF A STATE-FUNDED POLICY IN ONE COMMUNITY (HEALTH CARE, EMERGENCY CARE, UNINSURED, KANSAS, PRIMARY CARE)",Betty Smith-Campbell,political_science,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281451W,/authors/OL5370531A/Betty_Smith-Campbell,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 107,"America is in the midst of a health care crisis, and access to health care is a significant problem. As this crisis has escalated with little response from the federal government, state governments have begun to respond. For example, Kansas enacted a law in 1991 (HB 2019) to provide funding for primary care services for the medically indigent. Health Care Access (HCA), a community based volunteer clinic in Douglas County, KS, received this state funding and the services they provided increased dramatically. Little research has been done to assess the impact of organizations, such as HCA, on access to care. The purpose of this research study was to determine whether this state funding policy influenced access to health care for the medically indigent in Douglas County, KS.  This quantitative descriptive study was guided by the Aday, Anderson and Fleming (1980) Access Framework. A descriptive design was used to gather information on the characteristics of the health care system and the medically indigent in Douglas County, KS. To determine whether state funding for primary health care services for the medically indigent in Douglas County, KS decreased Emergency Department (ED) visits by the uninsured, a retrospective design was employed. Client satisfaction with care at HCA was examined using a cross sectional survey.  It was revealed in the findings that the uninsured visited the ED proportionately more frequently than the insured. The data showed that within three years after state funding of HCA was initiated, uninsured visits to the ED decreased by 63 percent, while insured visits continued to increase. The survey results revealed that HCA clients had a high level of satisfaction with the care they received at HCA.  In the era of accountability and downsizing of government services, state funded initiatives need to be evaluated to assess their effectiveness. This study will allow Kansas state legislators to evaluate the influence of one state policy on access to health care. Most importantly, legislators and citizens need to be informed that their financial and volunteer support can influence the availability and utilization of services and the satisfaction of services of the medically indigent.

From the bestselling author of The Dark Side, an electrifying work of investigative journalism that uncovers the agenda of this powerful group.  In her new preface, Jane Mayer discusses the results of the most recent election and Donald Trump’s victory, and how, despite much discussion to the contrary, this was a huge victory for the billionaires who have been pouring money in the American political system.  Why is America living in an age of profound and widening economic inequality? Why have even modest attempts to address climate change been defeated again and again? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers? In a riveting and indelible feat of reporting, Jane Mayer illuminates the history of an elite cadre of plutocrats—headed by the Kochs, the Scaifes, the Olins, and the Bradleys—who have bankrolled a systematic plan to fundamentally alter the American political system. Mayer traces a byzantine trail of billions of dollars spent by the network, revealing a staggering conglomeration of think tanks, academic institutions, media groups, courthouses, and government allies that have fallen under their sphere of influence. Drawing from hundreds of exclusive interviews, as well as extensive scrutiny of public records, private papers, and court proceedings, Mayer provides vivid portraits of the secretive figures behind the new American oligarchy and a searing look at the carefully concealed agendas steering the nation. Dark Money is an essential book for anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.    source: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215462/dark-money-by-jane-mayer/   Read more Read less",21 Want to read|3 Currently reading|5 Have read

Medical cannabis is now legal in eighteen states and Washington, D.C., and more than one million Americans have turned to it in place of conventional pharmaceuticals. Yet the federal government refuses to acknowledge these broader societal shifts and continues to raid and arrest people: 49.5 percent of all drug-related arrests involve the sale, manufacture, or possession of cannabis. In the first book to explore the new landscape of cannabis in the United States, investigative journalists Alyson Martin and Nushin Rashidian present a deeply researched, insightful story of how recent developments tie into cannabis's complex history and thorny politics. Reporting from nearly every state with a medical cannabis law, Martin and Rashidian enliven their book with in-depth interviews with patients, growers, doctors, entrepreneurs, politicians, activists, and regulators. They whisk readers from the federal cannabis farm at the University of Mississippi to the headquarters of the ACLU to Oregon's ""World Famous Cannabis Cafe;."" They present an expert analysis of how recent milestones toward legalization will affect the war on drugs both domestically and internationally. The result is an unprecedented and lucid account of how legalization is manifesting itself in the lives of millions. A New Leaf offers an essential guide for anyone who wants to understand the far-ranging implications of this rapidly changing drug landscape.

John Dean, of Watergate fame, knows what it's like to work for a strong-willed, vindictive president. But even Richard Nixon, says Dean, didn't have the raw lust for power that Donald Trump has. Nor the lack of skill. Nor the deep ignorance of our democracy. So how did such a loathsome character achieve power' Suspecting the answer lay in understanding Trump's base constituency, Dean has partnered with Bob Altemeyer, a professor of psychology whose expertise is the study of authoritarianism, to see why Trump's base is so faithful to him, no matter what he does. By using some classic psychological diagnostic tools (such as the ""Power Mad Scale"" and the ""Con Man Scale"") and looking at other historic authoritarians and their movements, Dean and Altemeyer offer not only an eye-opening revelation of how Trump and his followers have gotten where they have, but where they may go next.

This positive identification was not matched by the opposing camp's designation of Anti-Federalism, which only denotes what that group did NOT support.  Ethan Allen and others are treated to an overdue examination by Storing, who brings into greater relief these other founding fathers.  It is to them that the US owes the creation of the Bill of Rights, for which the Anti-Federalists withheld their ratification votes until they were extended a promise of immediate amendment from the pro-passage camp.

Have the problem and its solution been misconceived and misrepresented, as manifested by the problematic aftermath of Iraq War? Has 9/11 rendered redundant past international ordering strategies, or are these still discarded at our own peril? These are the questions explored in this Adelphi Paper. It opens by focusing attention on the linked problems of enmity, power and legitimacy, which lie at the root of the contemporary problem of order. The paper shows how the 'WMD order' that was constructed during and after the Cold War was challenged from various directions in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It shows how the growing disorder was a cause and effect of a potent 'double enmity' that arose in the US against both 'rogue states' and the international constitutionalism that had been espoused by previous US governments and bound states to a common purpose. An ordering strategy that is imperious and places its main emphasis on counter-proliferation and the threat of preventive war cannot be successful. The recovery of order must entail the pursuit of international legitimacy as well as efficacy. It will require all states to accept restraint and to honour their mutual obligations.

These include Marx's never translated German notes on Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, as well as Lewis Henry Morgan's' Ancient Society. Fischer's philosophical analysis of these texts demonstrates that there is a strain of Marxist ethics that is only understandable in the context of the great works of Western political theory and philosophy, particularly those that emphasize the republican value of public spiritedness, the communitarian value of solidarity and the liberal values of liberty and equality""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From Donald Trump's ""America First"" politics to Brexit to the rise of the right in Europe, events have forced a crucial debate: Should we fight for international government? Or should the world's nations keep their independence and self-determination?  In The Virtue of Nationalism, Yoram Hazony contends that a world of sovereign nations is the only option for those who care about personal and collective freedom. He recounts how, beginning in the sixteenth century, English, Dutch, and American Protestants revived the Old Testament's love of national independence, and shows how their vision eventually brought freedom to peoples from Poland to India, Israel to Ethiopia. It is this tradition we must restore, he argues, if we want to limit conflict and hate--and allow human difference and innovation to flourish.

Singapore is a state that has firmly rejected welfarism but whose political leaders have maintained that collective values, instead of those of autonomous individuals, are essential to its very survival.The book begins by examining basic concepts of citizenship, nationality and the state in the context of Singapore's arrival at independence. The theme of nation-building is explored and how the creation of a national identity, through building new institutions, has been a central feature of political and social life in Singapore. Of great importance has been education, and a system of multilingual education that is part of a broader government strategy of multiculturalism and multiracialism; both have served the purpose of building a new national identity. Other areas covered by the authors include family planning, housing policy, the creation of parapolitical structures and the imporatnce of shared 'Asian values' amongst Singapore's citizens.

Yet on the Spanish island of Cuba, barely fifty miles away, the events in Haiti helped usher in the antithesis of revolutionary emancipation. There, planters and authorities saw the devastation of their neighboring colony and rushed to prevent the same events from happening in Cuba by buttressing the institutions of slavery and colonial rule.  Freedom's Mirror follows the reverberations of the Haitian Revolution in Cuba, where the violent entrenchment of slavery occurred at the very moment that the Haitian Revolution provided a powerful and proximate example of slaves destroying slavery. By linking two stories--the story of the Haitian Revolution and that of the rise of Cuban slave society--that are usually told separately, Ada Ferrer sheds fresh light on both of these crucial moments in Caribbean and Atlantic history""--Provided by publisher.

It therefore deals especially with the return of religious themes and symbols into politics, with the analysis of the link between political theory and religion, and finally with the critical discussion of the secularization thesis. At the centre of the research are questions concerning the causes of violent conflict, the possibilities for a just world order and the conditions for peaceful coexistence on a local, regional, national and international/worldwide scale between communities in the face of divergent religious and ideological convictions. Its task is to initiate and coordinate thematically related research-efforts from various disciplinary backgrounds at the University of Innsbruck. It creates a network between departments, research-teams and single researchers working on topics of religion, politics and violence. The overall aim of the research platform World Order-Religion-Violence is to promote excellence in social and human science research on religion and politics at the University of Innsbruck and to guarantee the diffusion of this particular competence on a national and international level.""

In Presidential Leadership in Public Opinion, Jeffrey E. Cohen argues that the perception of presidential leadership in American politics is affected not so much by what presidents accomplish but by whether voters think their president is a good leader. When assessing whether a president is a good leader, voters ask two questions: Does the president represent me and the nation? And, is the president strong? Cohen shows that presidential interactions with Congress affect voter perceptions of presidential representation and strength. These perceptions have important implications for public attitudes about American politics. They affect presidential approval ratings, the performance of candidates in presidential elections, attitudes toward Congress, and trust in government. Perceptions of presidential leadership qualities have implications not only for the presidency but also for the larger political system""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The multi-year, multi-billion dollar operation elected the nation's first black president, raised and spent more money than any other election effort in history, and built the most sophisticated voter targeting technology ever before used on a national campaign. But what is missing from these accounts is an understanding of how Obama for America organized its formidable army of 2.2 million volunteers -- over eight times the number of people who volunteered for democratic candidates in 2004. Unlike previous field campaigns that drew their power from staff, consultants, and paid canvassers, the Obama campaign's capacity came from unpaid local citizens who took responsibility for organizing their own neighborhoods months--and even years--in advance of election day. In so doing, Groundbreakers argues, the campaign enlisted citizens in the often unglamorous but necessary work of practicing democracy. Hahrie Han and Elizabeth McKenna argue that the legacy of Obama for America is a transformation of the traditional models of field campaigning. Groundbreakers makes the case that the Obama ground game was revolutionary in two regards not captured in previous accounts. First, the campaign piloted and scaled an alternative model of field campaigning that built the power of a community at the same time that it organized it. Second, the Obama campaign changed the individuals who were a part of it, turning them into leaders. Groundbreakers proves that presidential campaigns are still about more than clicks, big data and money, and that one of the most important ways that a campaign develops its capacity is by investing in its human resources""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From the adoption of new forms of electoral campaigning to the use of networking technology to organise social movements, media technology has the potential to radically change the way politics is conducted and experienced in this country. The first comprehensive volume on the impact of digital media on Australian politics, this book examines the way these technologies shape political communication, alter key public and private institutions, and serve as the new arena in which discursive and expressive political life is performed. Employing a range of theoretical perspectives, empirical data, and case examples, the book provides insights on political behaviour of Australia’s elites, as well as the increasingly important politics of mirco-activism and social media. Energetic and fast-paced, the book draws together a wide range of Australian and international scholarship on the interface between communications technology and politics. Crossing several genres, the book will find a wide audience amongst scholars of both politics and communication, among public relations professionals, and with members of the media themselves.

We?ve had enough false slogans of unity, which are just another form of divisiveness. It is time for a more difficult unity that acknowledges the reality of group differences and fights the deep inequities that divide us. Chua offers a bold new prescription for reversing our foreign policy failures and overcoming our destructive political tribalism at home. Print run 100,000.

But as financial institutions stagger and crumble, there is no obvious alternative. There is good reason to believe that, in a generation or so, capitalism will no longer exist: for the simple reason that it’s impossible to maintain an engine of perpetual growth forever on a finite planet. Yet faced with this prospect, the knee-jerk reaction is often to cling to what exists because they simply can’t imagine an alternative that wouldn’t be even more oppressive and destructive. The political imagination seems to have reached an impasse. Or has it?  In this collection of essays David Graeber explores a wide-ranging set of topics including political strategy, global trade, debt, imagination, violence, aesthetics, alienation, and creativity. Written in the wake of the anti-globalization movement and the rise of the war on terror, these essays survey the political landscape for signs of hope in unexpected places.  At a moment when the old assumption about politics and power have been irrefutably broken the only real choice is to begin again: to create a new language, a new common sense, about what people basically are and what it is reasonable for them to expect from the world, and from each other. In this volume Graeber draws from the realms of politics, art, and the imagination to start this conversation and to suggest that that the task might not be nearly so daunting as we’d be given to imagine.

Ein Gläschen Yarden-Wein auf den israelischen Golan,Karl Selent,political_science,First published in 2003,/works/OL13363099W,/authors/OL6256024A/Karl_Selent,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL21354305M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  Ça Ira|Language German|Pages 184,"Häresie in Zeiten der Heiligen Al Aksa Intifada ist, was der Autor in diesem Buch präsentiert. Er kauft bei Juden auf dem israelischen Golan und verteidigt die Siedler von Hebron. Der Autor weiß von PLO-Bomben gegen Antizionisten und verrät die exakte (!) Zahl der Jungfrauen, die den palästinensischen Märtyrer im Paradies erwarten. Vom Massaker in Sabra und Shatila will er nichts hören – berichtet jedoch über das zweite, das vergessene Massaker in den beiden Flüchtlingslagern, bei dem »wahrscheinlich noch mehr palästinensische Zivilisten als beim ersten Sabra-Shatila-Massaker ermordet wurden« (Udo Steinbach). Für die historischen arabischen Friedensbanditen Palästinas findet er adäquate Worte, den Kosovo-Palästinensern dagegen würde er gerne mal Ar-kan den Tiger zeigen. Er hat über den ersten Toten im virtuellen Cyber-Jihad zu berichten und bietet dem Leser aus gebührendem Abstand einen Blick ins Lager des »Humanitären Interventionismus«, wo propalästinensische Fraktionen der radikalen Linken als Protagonisten einer deutsch-europäischen »Friedenstruppe« für Nahost sich betätigen. Daher gibt es über linksradikale Walserisierung und Finkelsteinerei zu berichten, aber dies nicht allein in der deutsch-palästinensischen Linken, sondern auch beim Lieblingskind der deutschen Medien, der israeli-schen Friedensbewegung. Wider den Geschichtsrevisionismus verteidigt der Autor die Erkenntnis, das der Nah-ostkonflikt nur im Zusammenhang mit Antisemitismus und Holocaust zu begreifen ist. Er beschreibt die Verbindungen der frühen arabischen Nationalbewegung Palästinas zum Dritten Reich. Schon den Aufstand von 1936 bis ’39 betrieb die Bewegung mit italienischen Waffen und deutschem Geld. Die Verstrickung ihres Führers, des Muftis von Jerusalem, in den Holocaust ist bekannt; Selent aber weiß von weiteren, kaum oder gar nicht bekannten palästinensischen Nazi-Kollaborateuren.

Their encounter affirms the enduring need for a coherent theory of the revolutionary subject in the era of global capitalism, based on a political pedagogy of subaltern hegemony, solidarity, and reciprocal education. Investigating the political and economic lineages and outcomes of the mass uprising of Tahrir Square, De Smet discusses the emancipatory achievements and hegemonic failures of the Egyptian workers' and civil-democratic movements from the perspective of their (in)ability to construct a genuine dialectical pedagogy.""--Supplied by publisher.

THE EFFECT OF CASE-MIX REIMBURSEMENT ON NURSING HOME SPENDDOWN IN NEW YORK,Peter George Beatty,political_science,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278918W,/authors/OL5368263A/Peter_George_Beatty,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 339,"In recent years state and federal policymakers have become concerned about the effect of the high costs of nursing home care on both individual patients and public budgets. Initial reports of the potentially catastrophic financial impact of nursing home care on a high proportion of the elderly were subsequently brought into question by studies using national samples. State specific studies of spenddown, however, suggest that the national studies may have underestimated the extent of the problem. Neither national or state-specific studies have related the occurrence of spenddown to specific reimbursement methodologies. Using a random sample of 3366 patients admitted to New York nursing homes as private payers during the period 1985 through 1988, this study documents the prevalence of spenddown in New York and uses event history methods to test hypotheses regarding changes in risk for spenddown following the start of New York's case-mix reimbursement system, and regarding the effect of nursing home and market characteristics on spenddown risk. It was found that (1) spenddown in New York is substantially higher than reported in other state and national studies; (2) subjects admitted in the years following the start of RUG-II were significantly less likely to convert to Medicaid; and (3) during the years 1985 through 1988 there was a dramatic decrease in Medicaid admissions and a corresponding increase in Medicare admissions.

Featuring new, original and imaginative reflections, world leaders in law, sociology, politics, economics and international studies, interrogate global governance as it is and as it ought to be. It asks: What are the principal forces, structures, movements and ideas shaping global governance under conditions of global crisis? And what are the likely prospects for transformations in the theory and practice of global governance? The contributors highlight alternative imaginaries and social forces harnessing new organizational and political forms to counter and displace dominant strategies of rule. In so doing, they suggest that to meaningfully address intensifying economic, ecological and ethical crises of the early 21st century in ways more consistent with greater social justice, democracy and the integrity biosphere will require far more effective, legitimate and far-sighted forms of global governance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The common thread for oligarchs across history is that wealth defines them, empowers them, and inherently exposes them to threats. The existential motive of all oligarchs is wealth defense. How they respond varies with the threats they confront, including how directly involved they are in supplying the coercion underlying all property claims, and whether they act separately or collectively. These variations yield four types of oligarchy: warring, ruling, sultanistic, and civil. Oligarchy is not displaced by democracy but rather is fused with it. Moreover, the rule of law problem in many societies is a matter of taming oligarchs. Cases studied in this book include the United States, ancient Athens and Rome, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, medieval Venice and Siena, mafia commissions in the United States and Italy, feuding Appalachian families, and early chiefs cum oligarchs dating from 2300 BCE""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|1 Have read

A MEDICAID RESIDENT ASSESSMENT-BASED STATEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERMEDIATE CARE NURSING HOMES,Anne Howard Pyles Glass,political_science,First published in 1989,/works/OL12266161W,/authors/OL5358220A/Anne_Howard_Pyles_Glass,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 195,"Through development of a conceptual model and an index measure based on actual performance, this dissertation focused on clarifying what is ""very good"" (and ""very bad"") in nursing home quality. The model expanded on the traditional narrow image of nursing home quality of care, and specified four major dimensions of this broader view of quality. The dimensions (staff intervention, nutrition/food service, physical environment, and community relations) were each reduced further to two sub-dimensions. Factors influencing quality were also delineated.  The new model was then used to tie specific measurable indicators to the overall quality construct. Quality indicators derived from standardized assessments of Medicaid residents were employed in a study of 135 intermediate care facilities in Virginia. Process variables, such as use of physical restraints, catheters, and receipt of various therapies, were analysed for 12,327 residents. Outcome variables (weight loss, increased dependencies in activities of daily living, new pressure sores) were determined through longitudinal analysis for residents with an appropriate preceding assessment (n = 9,006). Assessments were aggregated in each home to calculate a mean (percentage incidence) for each of the 14 quality indicators.  A scaling system was used clearly identify industry ""norms"" for each variable. Quintiles based on relative incidence were employed to assign homes to five levels of performance. Scale scores were summed to obtain a facility index measure of relative quality. Reliability and validity were evaluated. Relationships of case-mix and selected structural variables (size, ownership, location, percent Medicaid, staff ratios) to the quality measure were analysed.  Results suggested better performance by non-profit and smaller homes, but proprietary and non-profit facilities were about evenly represented among the top tenth percentile of homes. Presence of a skilled care unit appeared to negatively influence quality. Possible interactions and explanations for this finding were considered. Most significantly, the study demonstrated that resident assessments can serve as excellent information sources about what goes on in nursing homes. However, additional variables must be incorporated to make a comprehensive quality measure, based on the model. Recommendations and policy implications were discussed.

The present challenge is for man to live and work in a permanently based space station. Nurses work everywhere people are found and nurses relate to and care for the whole person. The purpose of this research was to describe the role of the nurses in the United States space program.  Qualitative research using an exploratory descriptive design was conducted. Interviews, participant observation, and content analysis of available documents were the methods of data collection. Nurses employed by NASA were the primary informants. Additional informants included other members of the space term and/or their families, and other persons involved in the space program. Participant observation was conducted at two NASA field centers involved in health-related research, and one major university involved in space-related research. Informants employed at other agencies or field centers were interviewed by telephone.  The findings of this study offer a conceptual framework constructed from the data that represents a beginning substantive theory. Roles were classified as practitioner, researcher, administrator/manager, teacher, and consultant. Analysis of the data revealed three major categories within each role. The categories were: duties/responsibilities, knowledge/skills, and values. Common themes used by the informants in describing their roles were identified and grouped by categories. The common themes were: nurses function primarily in a support role, nurses have strong observation/data collection skills, and nurses are valued members of the space team because of their ability to care for the whole person. Future opportunities for nurses within the roles of practitioner, researcher, and consultant were identified.  Additional research using futures methodology is needed to identify the future role of the space nurse. The role of ground-based nursing in the space program should be distinguished from the role of the space nurse.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CASE-MIX REIMBURSEMENT FOR NURSING HOME CARE USING A DYNAMIC SIMULATION MODEL,Daniel E. Gordon,political_science,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265441W,/authors/OL5357635A/Daniel_E._Gordon,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 235,"This study uses a computer simulation model to determine whether case-mix reimbursement (CMR) for nursing homes can reduce the excess waiting time faced by heavy-care public-pay patients who seek nursing home care.  Under fixed-rate reimbursement nursing homes are biased against admitting public-pay heavy-care patients. CMR differs from fixed-rate schemes by matching nursing home payments to the level of care patients need.  A system dynamics model was developed to investigate how the characteristics of CMR policies and the conditions under which they operate determine CMR's effectiveness.  The model simulated patient flow through the general community, hospitals, nursing homes, home care, hospital long-term care queues and community long-term queues.  Analysis of model behavior was followed by a series of experiments in which price and time characteristics of CMR and long-term care sector growth were systematically varied.  The following conclusions are drawn: (1) Patient cross-flows cause the system to appear unresponsive to reimbursement changes, even when nursing homes admission behavior has, in fact, changed. Because of the cross-flows, changes in nursing home admission behavior may not change patients' waiting time. (2) Patient waiting time is the key measure of the effectiveness of CMR. Patient composition, queue sizes and admission rates are likely to be misleading. (3) Case-mix reimbursement can reduce high-need public-pay patients' waiting times. (4) The reduction is affected by the characteristics of the CMR policy and by the scenario in which it operates. (5) Most CMR policies increase public nursing home costs, but some reduction in waiting time gap can be managed without additional expenditure. (6) The general price level and the price boost for high-need patients determine the expenditure level, but the frequency of patient assessment and the time lag in implementing a new reimbursement rate determine the efficiency of the policy. (7) CMR is more effective when LTC resources are scarce, but its effect is overshadowed by the increased waiting times caused by the shortage. (8) The efficiency of CMR is affected by the quantity of LTC resources available.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
EDUCATION AS A DETERMINANT OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF NURSE-MIDWIVES,Theresa Christine Gesse,political_science,First published in 1989,/works/OL12265355W,/authors/OL5357559A/Theresa_Christine_Gesse,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1989|Pages 239,"This study examined political participation among nurse-midwives and investigated relationships which influence electoral, non-electoral, and unconventional political activities. Of particular interest was the effect of education, a key variable in political participation studies. The study also examined the professional advancement of nurse-midwifery in both an historical and societal context.  The evolution of nurse-midwifery has been closely linked with economic, social and political events. Political participation is viewed by nurse-midwifery leaders as a mechanism for involvement in decision making relative to nurse-midwifery's professional identity and to health care of women and infants.  A mail survey was conducted using a random sample from the membership of the American College of Nurse-Midwives which yielded 364 respondents and a 59.7% response rate. The questionnaire used was modified from that of Hanley (1983) which incorporated items from studies reported by Verba and Nie (1972), Milbrath (1976), and the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies (1976, 1979).  Factor analysis identified five modes of political participation in this sample. These are community/contacting activities, protest, voting, campaigning and petitioning. The relationships and effects of the predictor variables on each of these modes were analyzed using bivariate cross-tabulation and correlation techniques, and multivariate regression analysis.  Findings indicated that the majority of nurse-midwives have increased their involvement in professional activities since becoming a nurse-midwife and support the political activism of the American College of Nurse-Midwives. Individually, voting is the predominant political activity among this group who are inclined to be pro feminist and who believe that people like themselves can influence governmental activities. Education was not identified as a predictor of political participation. Support of women's issues, sense of political efficacy, and feminist attitudes were positive predictors of political participation. Thus, this sample of nurse-midwives deviated from the standard models of political participation developed in the general population.

A POLICY IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS: NURSE AIDE CERTIFICATION IN FLORIDA,Pamela Tarquinio Brannon,political_science,First published in 1993,/works/OL12278669W,/authors/OL5368046A/Pamela_Tarquinio_Brannon,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 179,"Policy implementation is recognized as a major component of the public policy process, and an important area for public administration research. The literature calls for the examination of public projects to improve policy design and implementation, for the comparison of expected implementation with actual implementation, and for the examination of the role of states in implementing federal policy. This dissertation addressed those areas by analyzing the implementation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87) which contains federal requirements for certification of nurse aides (nursing assistants) who are employed in Medicare and Medicaid funded nursing homes. The dissertation focused on the state of Florida and three levels of analysis: policies and practices of the state, nursing home operations and procedures, and individuals in the certification process. Multiple methods of data collection and data analysis were used and included: an analysis of the history, development and content of the federal policy, interviews with state administrators, a survey of nursing home administrators, an analysis of state certification statistics, documentary analysis, factor analysis and content analysis.  Some of the data indicate that, although Florida has had a nurse aide certification process in place since 1982, there may be some uneven implementation of the certification process at the local level, and that race may have an impact on the certification rate. These areas were recommended for further study. A descriptive model, developed from the research design, outlined three dimensions that should be examined in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis of policy implementation: the origin of the policy, the agent of the policy, and the target of the policy. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis should examine the communication between the dimensions. In this dissertation, the federal legislation was the origin, the state of Florida was the agent, and nursing homes and prospective nurse aides were the targets. The descriptive model can be used for future implementation studies whether the origin of the policy is federal, state or local legislation.

IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITIZING POLITICAL VALUES AND SKILLS ESSENTIAL IN INFLUENCING PUBLIC POLICY: A COMPONENT OF THE POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION OF BACCALAUREATE NURSING STUDENTS,Sandra Godman Brown,political_science,First published in 1990,/works/OL12267528W,/authors/OL5359402A/Sandra_Godman_Brown,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1990|Pages 155,"The focus of the health care delivery system is changing from one of providing care to all Americans to a focus on economic considerations. As a result, the need for nursing to possess political values and skills needed to influence public policy is imperative. However, these values and skills have not been identified or prioritized. The purpose of this descriptive study, which used political and professional socialization theories as its framework, was to determine if political values and skills needed to influence public policy could be identified and prioritized on a two-part, six-section, open-ended questionnaire.  One hundred and ten baccalaureate nursing faculty, 22 nurse political experts, and 26 political experts participated in the study. Four hundred and ninety-six responses were categorized into 13 categories. Data were analyzed for consensus on priority and category selection. There was agreement on the priority of less than 21% of rankings among the three sample groups. Nurse political experts and the political experts were in agreement on 20.5% of the selections, while nursing faculty and nurse political experts agreed on 14.1% of the priority choices. In evaluating the top five category selections of the three sample groups, there was more agreement between the expert groups than with either group and the nursing faculty. The majority of the responses by the expert groups related to qualities of the individual. Nursing faculty selected more idealistic categories, such as Democratic Principles and Ideologies.

"A STUDY OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION BY REGISTERED NURSES IN ILLINOIS (FEMINISM, KING MODEL OF NURSING)",Teresa J. Krassa,political_science,First published in 1994,/works/OL12279931W,/authors/OL5369156A/Teresa_J._Krassa,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1994|Pages 236,"This study examined factors influencing political participation of Illinois nurses and described the effect of Illinois Nurses' Association (INA) membership on political behavior. The conceptual framework was from King's Model of Nursing (1981), and Verba and Nie (1972), and Hanley (1983).  The variables age, race, income, nursing education, political socialization, urbanization, organizational participation, partisan strength, ideological constraint, political efficacy, feminist attitudes, and political participation were assessed in surveys sent to 700 Illinois nurses; the response rate was 50.6%. Two subgroups were INA members and non-members; response rates were 54.6% and 46.6% respectively.  Factor analysis revealed five modes of political participation, and showed INA members to be more active in politics than non-members on all five modes, although the difference was significant for campaign, contacting/expressing views, and protest modes only. Correlation analyses indicated that education, age, internal and external political efficacy affect participation for INA members and non-members, but feminist attitudes and partisanship affect participation for INA members only.  Regressions indicated that nurse participation is predicted by organizational activity, internal efficacy, education, age, and mother's political interest. Organizations affect all participation modes; either organizational activity or membership was the most powerful predictor of participation in each regression. INA membership did not have an impact separate from the effects of organizations. Education predicts campaigning and protest behavior; internal efficacy predicts campaigning and contacting/expressing views. External efficacy and feminist orientation predict communal and voting behavior. Implications for research and education discussed.

King's active and daily participation in that movement, from its inception through its demise, provides a unique insider perspective to illustrate how the Oakland police and city administrators lost the ability to effectively control the movement. Drawn from King's intensive field work, the book focuses on the physical, legal, political, and ideological dimensions of repression--in the streets, in courtrooms, in the media, in city hall, and within the movement itself--When Riot Cops Are Not Enough highlights the central role of political legitimacy, both for mass movements seeking to create social change, as well as for governmental forces seeking to control such movements. Although Occupy Oakland was different from other Occupy sites in many respects, King shows how the contradictions it illuminated within both social movement and police strategies provide deep insights into the nature of protest policing generally, and a clear map to understanding the full range of social control techniques used in North America in the twenty-first century""--  ""This book examines the policing, and broader political repression, of Occupy Oakland. This project emerged from the authors active, daily participation in the movement, from its inception through its demise. The book illustrates how the Oakland police and city administrators lost their ability to effectively control the movement in its first two months, while its primary objective is to show how, through a variety of techniques, they were able to regain that control. After a failure to establish communicative cooperation with the movement (negotiated management), techniques of militarized policing, less-lethal weapons, and coordinated efforts to forge police control of urban space (strategic incapacitation) failed miserably in late-October 2011- leading to over 50,000 people shutting down the Port of Oakland a week later. Drawn from almost a year of intensive field work, the book focuses on the period from Occupy Oakland's beginnings, in early October 2011, until its last major mass action on May 1, 2012. Looking at the physical, legal and politico-ideological dimensions of repression - in the streets, in courtrooms, in the media, in city hall, and within the movement itself - this book highlights the central role of political legitimacy, both for mass movements seeking to create social change, as well as for forces seeking to control those movements. Although Occupy Oakland was very different from other U.S. Occupy sites in many respects, the contradictions it illuminated within both social movement and police strategies provide deep insights into the nature of protest policing generally, and a clear map to understanding the full range of social control techniques used in North America in the current moment.

Hailed by The Washington Post as a 'master of the political profile, ' Leibovich has spent his career writing memorable, buzz-worthy, and often jaw-dropping features about politicians and other notables. Currently chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine, Leibovich punctures the inflated personas of the powerful, and in Citizens of the Green Room, he reveals the lives, stories, and peculiarities behind the public masks. A brilliant reporter with a talent for subversive, engaging storytelling, Leibovich maintains a refreshing conviviality with many of his subjects even as he renders incisive and unflinching assessments. His features have driven the national conversation while exposing the fallibilities of the kingmakers and media stars: consider his 2007 profile of Hillary Clinton, which unearthed a treasure trove of old letters that the then senator had written as a vulnerable young college student; or his much-talked-about 2010 portrait of Glenn Beck, which laid bare the tortured soul and precarious standing of the once invincible host and his uneasy relationship with his soon-to-be ex-employer FOX News. In the political arena, Leibovich's portraits of John Kerry, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, and John McCain are already classics; they invariably remind us that great journalism and stylish writing are not only essential to the Republic but necessary to maintain the citizenry's sanity and humor in the face of made-for-TV government""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A month later, reports surfaced that Washington had been covertly selling arms to Iran (our sworn enemy and a state sponsor of terrorism), in exchange for help freeing hostages in Beirut. The profits, it turned out, were going to support the Contras, despite an explicit ban by Congress. In the firestorm that erupted, shocking details emerged, raising the prospect of impeachment, and the American public confronted a scandal as momentous as it was confusing. At its center was President Ronald Reagan amid a swirl of questions about illegal wars, consorting with terrorists, and the abuse of presidential power. Yet, despite the enormity of the issues, the affair dropped from the public radar due to media overkill, years of legal wrangling, and a vigorous campaign to forestall another Watergate. As a result, many Americans failed to grasp the scandal's full import. Through exhaustive use of declassified documents, previously unavailable investigative materials, and wide-ranging interviews, Malcolm Byrne revisits this largely forgotten and misrepresented episode. Placing the events in their historical and political context (notably the Cold War and a sharp partisan domestic divide), he explores what made the affair possible and meticulously relates how it unfolded--including clarifying minor myths about cakes, keys, Bibles, diversion memos, and shredding parties. Iran-Contra demonstrates that, far from being a 'junta' against the president, the affair could not have occurred without awareness and approval at the very top of the U.S. government. Byrne reveals an unmistakable pattern of dubious behavior--including potentially illegal conduct by the president, vice president, the secretaries of state and defense, the CIA director and others--that formed the true core of the scandal. Given the lack of meaningful consequences for those involved, the volume raises critical questions about the ability of our current system of checks and balances to address presidential abuses of power, and about the possibility of similar outbreaks in the future""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dismantling public policy,Michael W. Bauer,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL20956073W,/authors/OL7887418A/Michael_W._Bauer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English,"Policy dismantling is a distinctive form of policy change, which involves the cutting, reduction, diminution or complete removal of existing policies. The perceived need to dismantle existing policies normally acquires particular poignancy during periods of acute economic austerity. Dismantling is thought to be especially productive of political conflict, pitting those who benefit from the status quo against those who, for whatever reason, seek change. However, scholars of public policy have been rather slow to offer a comprehensive account of the precise conditions under which particular aspects of policy are dismantled, grounded in systematic empirical analysis. Although our overall understanding of what causes policy to change has accelerated a lot in recent decades, there remains a bias towards the study of either policy expansion or policy stability. Dismantling does not even merit a mention in most public policy textbooks. Yet without an account of both expansion and dismantling, our understanding of policy change in general, and the politics surrounding the cutting of existing policies, will remain frustratingly incomplete. This book seeks to develop a more comparative approach to understanding policy dismantling, by looking in greater detail at the dynamics of cutting in two different policy fields: one (social policy) which has been subjected to study before and the other (environmental policy) which has not. On the basis of a systematic analysis of the existing literatures in these two fields, it develops a new analytical framework for measuring and explaining policy dismantling. Through an analysis of six, fresh empirical cases of dismantling written by leading experts, it reveals a more nuanced picture of change, focusing on what actually motivates actors to dismantle, the strategies they use to secure their objectives and the politically significant effects they ultimately generate. Dismantling Public Policy is essential reading for anyone wanting to better understand a hugely important facet of contemporary policy and politics. It will inform a range of student courses in comparative public policy, politics, social and environmental policy.   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Three and half decades later, behind its rapid growth and glitzy façade, modernization under one-party rule has spawned a form of rapacious crony capitalism characterized by endemic corruption, an incipient kleptocracy, record income inequality, and high social tensions. This book traces the origin of China's crony capitalism to a set of incomplete reforms of property rights in the post-Tiananmen era that have decentralized the control of public property without clarifying its ownership. This combination has created an ideal environment for political and economic elites to collude and amass private wealth through systematic theft of nominally state-owned property, in particular land, natural resources, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Based on illuminating details from 260 well-researched cases of corruption involved multiple officials and businessmen since the early 1990s, this study investigates how collusion among elites has penetrated the vital sectors of the Chinese political and economic systems. These cases reveal a well-developed illicit market for power inside the Chinese party-state, in which bribes and official appointments are surreptitiously but routinely traded. They also document the widespread theft inside Chinese SOEs and collusion between law enforcement officials and organized crime. Above all, through its in-depth analysis of the exchange of money for favors between government officials and private businessmen, the study shines a spotlight on the dark world of crony capitalism in China - and a Leninist regime in late-stage decay.""--   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It notes that traditional approaches to urban planning (particularly in developing countries) have largely failed to promote equitable, efficient and sustainable human settlements and to address twenty-first century challenges, including rapid urbanization, shrinking cities and aging, climate change and related disasters, urban sprawl and unplanned peri-urbanization, as well as urbanization of poverty and informality. It concludes that new approaches to planning can only be meaningful, and have a greater chance of succeeding, if they effectively address all of these challenges, are participatory and inclusive, as well as linked to contextual socio-political processes.--Publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Revolutionary Dissent brings alive a world of colorful and stormy protests that included effigies, pamphlets, songs, sermons, cartoons, letters and liberty trees. Solomon explores through a series of chronological narratives how Americans of the Revolutionary period employed robust speech against the British and against each other. Uninhibited dissent provided a distinctly American meaning to the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and press at a time when the legal doctrine inherited from England allowed prosecutions of those who criticized government. Solomon discovers the wellspring in our revolutionary past for today's satirists like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann, and protests like flag burning and street demonstrations. From the inflammatory engravings of Paul Revere, the political theater of Alexander McDougall, the liberty tree protests of Ebenezer McIntosh and the oratory of Patrick Henry, Solomon shares the stories of the dissenters who created the American idea of the liberty of thought. This is truly a revelatory work on the history of free expression in America""--  ""When the Framers of the Constitution developed what we call today the Freedom of Speech, they didn't realize they would be setting a foundation for the American political character we know today - raucous, intemperate, and often mean-spirited. This character is not limited to contemporary political discourse, as we so often assume. Revolutionary Dissent brings alive a world far more complicated than the history we're all familiar with suggests, giving a clear picture of just how imprecise the Framers were about what such freedoms actually meant. Solomon explores through a series of chronological, advancing narratives how Americans employed robust and colorful expression as they debated separation from England and creation of a new system of government. Uninhibited protest provided vital meaning to the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and presses at a time when legal doctrine offered little protection from government prosecution. Revolutionary Dissent shows that the roots of the careers of satirists like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert and pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann, and the acts of flag burning, draft card destruction, and sit-ins like Occupy Wall Street, lie in the Revolutionary period's inflammatory engravings of Paul Revere, the polemics of Thomas Paine, and the symbol-laden protests again the Stamp Act.

The kingdom's western province contains the heart of Islam, and it is the United States' closest Arab ally and the largest producer of oil in the world. However, the country is undergoing rapid change: its aged leadership is ceding power to a new generation, and its society, dominated by young people, is restive. Saudi Arabia has long remained closed to foreign scholars, with a select few academics allowed into the kingdom over the past decade. This book presents the fruits of their research as well as those of the most prominent Saudi academics in the field. This volume focuses on different sectors of Saudi society and examines how the changes of the past few decades have affected each. It reflects new insights and provides the most up-to-date research on the country's social, cultural, economic and political dynamics""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In it we find a forward-looking vision of a world respectful of human rights, dominated by liberal democracies, and united in a cosmopolitan federation of diverse peoples. The essay is an expression of global idealism that remains an enduring antidote to the violence and cynicism that are all too often on display in international relations and foreign affairs. This book features a fresh and vigorous translation of Kant's essay by Ian Johnston, and it includes an extended introduction by philosopher Brian Orend. The introduction situates Kant's essay in its historical context and offers a substantial analysis, section by section, of the essay itself. In doing so, Orend not only discusses Kant's personal life and the history of the perpetual peace tradition, he also shows how Kant's provocative ideas have inspired and infused our own time, especially the concept of a global alliance of free societies committed to respecting human rights.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book examines the consequences of this inequality for the legitimacy of democratic political institutions and systems. Using survey data collected in democracies around the globe, the authors argue that losing generates ambivalent attitudes towards political authorities. Because the efficacy and ultimately the survival of democratic regimes can be seriously threatened if the losers do not consent to their loss, the central themes of this book focus on losing: how losers respond to their loss and how institutions shape losing. While there tends to be a gap in support for the political system between winners and losers, it is not ubiquitous. The book paints a picture of losers' consent that portrays losers as political actors whose experience and whose incentives to accept defeat are shaped both by who they are as individuals as well as the political environment in which loss is given meaning."" ""Given that the winner-loser gap in legitimacy is a persistent feature of democratic politics, the findings presented in this book contain crucial implications for our understanding of the functioning and stability of democracies.""--BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Our Political Nature is the first book to reveal the hidden roots of our most deeply held moral values. It shows how political orientations across space and time arise from three clusters of measurable personality traits. These clusters entail opposing attitudes toward tribalism, inequality, and differing perceptions of human nature. Together, these traits are by far the most powerful cause of left-right voting, even leading people to regularly vote against their economic interests. As this book explains, our political personalities also influence our likely choice of a mate, and shape society's larger reproductive patterns. Most importantly of all, it tells the evolutionary stories of these crucial personality traits, which stem from epic biological conflicts. Based on dozens of exciting new insights from primatology, genetics, neuroscience, and anthropology, this groundbreaking work brings core concepts to life through current news stories and personalities. For instance, readers will meet Glenn Beck and Hugo Chavez and come to understand the underlying evolutionary forces they represent. By blending serious research with relevant contemporary examples, Our Political Nature casts important light onto the ideological clashes that so dangerously divide and imperil our world today""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book is divided into three parts-The New Permanent Government of Britain, The Left Escapes to the West and Britain through the looking glass. The first section deals with the ambiguous differences among the three major parties in the UK, Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. That is to say that the policies of the parties cannot be distinguished to any degree and that Mr. Hitchens states that no matter who wins next year's general elections, the policies will remain in place. That philosophy is trying to take hold in America with the rise of the RINOs (Republican in names only) who to try to emulate the same things as the Tories in the UK today in terms of going along to get along.  The second part deals with the leaking of leftist ideologies from the former Warsaw Pact to the West. Mr. Hitchens seemed frustrated that the West won a hard fought Cold War only to see socialism rise in a disheartened Britain.  The last part has Mr. Hitchens going into various aspects of modern life in the UK and how it has played on its culture. The creation of the motorways and the destruction of the railways has left Britain more dependent on the automobile and truck for transportation. His address on this issue reminds me of when the Pacific Electric Railway was demolished in Los Angeles to foster highway construction in Southern California. Also he takes up the case against the leftist-Tory alliance in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think that Mr. Hitchens is right when he says that women have traded the hard work of motherhood for the slavery of the workplace where beauty and sexiness are assets that are vital to keep their job. The rise in plastic surgery could be traced to this very fact. Education mediocrity is derided as well when the author cites the damage that American-type public education has done to the UK with the replacement of the former grammar schools and meritorious advancement.  Mr. Hitchens has written a great book that deserves to be read by those on this side of the pond in light of the conflict today in Washington; it could prove helpful.

They tell inside stories--how Danes outmaneuvered the Nazis, Solidarity defeated Polish communism, and mass action removed a Chilean dictator--and also how nonviolent power is changing the world today, from Burma to Serbia.

Schmitter and Marc Blecher, provide a lively introduction to the concepts and framework to study and analyze politics.  Written with dexterity, concision and clarity, this short text makes no claim to being scientific. It contains no disprovable hypotheses, no original collection of evidence, and no search for patterns of association. Instead, Schmitter and Blecher keep the text broadly conceptual and theoretical to convey their vision of the sprawling subject of politics. They map the process in which researchers try to specify the goal of the trip, some of the landmarks likely to be encountered en route, and the boundaries that will circumscribe the effort. Examples, implications and elaborations are included in footnotes throughout the book.  Politics as a Science is an ideal introduction for anyone interested in, or studying, comparative politics.""

Whereas it is widely believed that the source materials for early medieval Europe are too sparse to allow sustained study of the workings of social and political relationships on the ground, this book focuses on a uniquely well-documented area to investigate the basis of power.

Poetry and radical politics in fin de siècle France,Patrick McGuinness,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL22312794W,/authors/OL2666496A/Patrick_McGuinness,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 289,"Poetry and radical politics in fin de siecle France' explores the relations between poetry and politics in France in the last decade of the 19th century. The period covers perhaps the most important developments in modern French poetry: from the post-Commune climate that spawned the 'decadent' movement, through to the (allegedly) ivory-towered aestheticism of Mallarme and the Symbolists. In terms of French politics, history and culture, the period was no less dramatic with the legacy of the Commune, the political and financial instability that followed, the anarchist campaigns, the Dreyfus affair, and the growth of 'Action francaise'. Patrick McGuinness argues that the anarchist politics of many Symbolist poets is a reaction to their own isolation, and to poetry's anxious relations with the public: too 'difficult' be be widely read, Symbolist poets react to the loss of poetry's centrality among the arts by delegating their radicalism to prose: they can call, in prose, for the overthrow of the state and support anarchist bombers, while at the same time writing poems about dribbling fountains and dazzling sunsets for each other. This study demonstrates the connections between the anti-Symbolist reaction of the ecole romane of 1891 (in which Charles Maurras first made his name), and the far-right cultural politics of Action francaise in the early 20th century. It also redefines many of the debates about late 19th-century French poetry by putting an argument forward for the political engagement(s) of the Symbolists while the French 'intellectuel' as a national icon was being forged. McGuinness insists on profound continuities between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th in terms of cultural politics, literary debate, and poetic theory, and shows how politics is to be found in unexpected ways in the least political-seeming literature of the period.

Paget shows how the CIA turned the National Student Association into an intelligence asset during the Cold War, with students used-often wittingly and sometimes unwittingly-as undercover agents inside America and abroad.  In 1967, Ramparts magazine exposed the story, prompting the Agency into engineering a successful cover-up.  Now Paget, drawing on archival sources, declassified documents, and more than 150 interviews, shows that the Ramparts story revealed only a small part of the plot.

It deals with environmental policy-making at institutional, national and international levels, and emphasises the solutions, as well as the problems.Within the overall context of sustainable development the book discusses the opportunities and constraints that environmental systems place upon the operation of human systems.  It suggests environmental policy is a potential way to modify the operation of human systems so that they function within environmental constraints.  Key social scientific concepts (political, social and economic) are used to explain the background for the formulation and implementation of environmental policy.Environmental problems, the role of humans in creating them, sustainable development and how this concept relates to environmental policy are all introduced.  The book then considers environmental policy formulation, implementation and evaluation, within three specific contexts: the firm, the nation state and at the international level. It also reviews the place of economics, science and technology in environmental policy.Environmental Policy is an accessible text with a multidisciplinary perspective. Detailed case-studies, drawn from a range of international examples, are used throughout to illustrate issues such as global warming, international trade, tourism and the human rights of indigenous peoples. It is well illustrated and includes end of chapter summaries and further reading.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Political extremism in democracies,William M.

Democracy's painful paradox seems to require tolerance of the intolerant, but democracy's defenders instead often ostracize and repress illiberal parties even when they enjoy broad electoral support. Drawing evidence from systematic comparison of contemporary pariah parties in seven European countries, the book classifies strategic responses of mainstream political actors and advances a framework for understanding cross-national differences. An inescapable, if normatively controversial, finding is that quarantining or banning extremists is less successful at containing or rolling back perceived threat than some forms of regulated inclusion""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The limousine liberal,Steve Fraser,political_science,First published in 2016,/works/OL20029907W?edition=ia%3Alimousineliberal0000fras,/authors/OL717062A/Steve_Fraser,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27209954M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Basic Books|Language English|Pages 291,"""No political metaphor in recent American history has enjoyed the impact of the ""limousine liberal."" It has managed to mobilize an enduring politics of resentment directed against everything from civil rights to women's liberation, from urban renewal to the war on poverty, from gay rights to the welfare state, from affirmative action to environmental regulation--and everyone from FDR to Hillary Clinton and Alger Hiss to Ben Afleck. Coined in 1969 by Mario Procaccino, a Democrat running for the mayoralty of New York City, the term took aim at what he and his largely white ethnic following considered the repellent hypocrisy of well-heeled types who championed the cause of the poor, especially the black poor, but who had no intention of bearing the costs of doing anything about their plight. In The Limousine Liberal, the acclaimed historian Steve Fraser argues that it is impossible to understand the perseverance and passion of right-wing populist politics in America without coming to grips with this metaphor, where it originated, how it evolved, why it persists, and where it may be taking us. He shows that the limousine liberal had existed in all but name long before Procaccino gave it one. From the ravings of Henry Ford in the 1920s to the ravings of Tea Party favorite Glenn Beck, it has served as the animus binding together right-wing populism in America. And it is responsible, in Fraser's view, for the modern conservative coalition of libertarian industrialists, technology impresarios, heartland evangelicals, and don't-tread-on-me small businessmen. Yet Fraser does not dismiss the limousine liberal as a phantasm conjured up by right-wing paranoids. To him the limousine liberal is a real figure on the American political landscape""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By giving full attention to this much-neglected group of women, Socialist Women examines and challenges the orthodox views of labour and suffrage history. Torn between competing loyalties of gender, class and politics, socialist women did not have a fixed identity but a number of contested identities. June Hannam and Karen Hunt probe issues that created divisions between these women, as well as giving them the opportunity to act together.  In three fascinating case studies they explore:* women's suffrage women and internationalism the politics of consumptionBelieving above all that being a woman was vital to their politics, these individuals sought to develop a woman-focused theory of socialism and to put this new politics into practice.Socialist Women explores what it meant to be a socialist woman against the backdrop of enormous political and social upheaval caused by the First World War and the growth of the women's suffrage movement.  The viewpoint of these women brings a new perspective to both socialist and feminist politics, which will make absorbing reading for anyone interested in gender history or the politics of this period.

Politicized motherhood persists, and motherhood continues to inspire women's participation and direct their concerns. In The Political Consequences of Motherhood, Jill S. Greenlee investigates the complex relationship between motherhood and women's political attitudes. Combining a historical overview of the ways motherhood has been used for political purposes with recent political opinion surveys and individual-level analysis, she explains how and when motherhood shapes women's thoughts and preferences. Greenlee argues that two mechanisms account for the durability of motherhood politics. First, women experience attitudinal shifts when they become mothers. Second, ""mother"" is a broad-based identity, widely shared and ideologically unconstrained, that lends itself to appeals across the political spectrum to build support for candidates and policy issues""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Subsequently, the book investigates the conditions under which post-accession liberalisation comes to a halt in countries once praised by the Democratisation and Europeanization literatures for their pace of reform.

The logic and limits of political reform in China,Joseph Fewsmith,political_science,First published in 2013,/works/OL16699881W,/authors/OL719255A/Joseph_Fewsmith,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Cambridge University Press|Language English,"""In the 1990s China embarked on a series of political reforms intended to increase, however modestly, political participation to reduce the abuse of power by local officials. Although there was initial progress, these reforms have largely stalled and, in many cases, gone backward. If there were sufficient incentives to inaugurate reform, why wasn,Ŵt there enough momentum to continue and deepen them? This book approaches this question by looking at a number of promising reforms, understanding the incentives of officials at different levels, and the way the Chinese Communist Party operates at the local level. The short answer is that the sort of reforms necessary to make local officials more responsible to the citizens they govern cut too deeply into the organizational structure of the party""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Australia is suffering from crisis of confidence. Globalisation, deregulation, and privatisation have delivered economic growth and enhanced consumption for the past twenty years, but the effects of the 2007-08 financial crisis, rising inequality, job insecurity, and increased corporate power over voters and employees are all eroding our sense of democracy.Meanwhile, with an election looming, the future of progressive politics nationwide is deeply uncertain. The Australian Labor Party and the Greens are splitting the left-of-centre vote -- the major party driven rightwards by an increasingly conservative swinging voter, and the minor party holding firm on vital but controversial issues. This book reviews the Greens' major economic, social, and environmental policies; and argues that progressive voters, and the nation as a whole, deserve an aligned ALP-Greens platform incorporating the best elements of each. With an annual government expenditure of $500 billion at stake -- not to mention the future of our social fabric and our very -- this is a time for visionary thinking, not old divisions and counter-productive rivalries.

Since then a consistent theme has been that black families are pathological.  Despite the fact that research has been inconclusive and contradictory, political debate and policy have been strongly influenced by the pathology theme. This volume presents alternative approaches toward understanding the special characteristics of black families. Extending a special issue of The Review of Black Political Economy, the book focuses on the economic circumstances and decision making of these families, employing Interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives. It examines the general responses of black families to various external factors such as economic systems, and to Internal factors such as interpersonal relationships.  This compendium of current thinking and research will be of interest to professionals in a number of fields, Including family studies, counseling, social work, psychology, and sociology. It will be of practical use in training programs for service delivery systems Interested In Incorporating multicultural perspectives, as well as those specifically interested in black families today.

Chamoiseau's work sheds light on the dynamic processes of creolization that have shaped Caribbean history and culture. He is the recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the prestigious Prix Goncourt for the epic novel Texaco. The author's diverse body of work, which includes plays, novels, fictionalized memoirs, treatises, and other genres of writing, offers a compelling vision of the postcolonial world from a francophone Caribbean perspective.An important addition to Caribbean literary studies, Patrick Chamoiseau is an indispensable work for scholars interested in francophone, Caribbean, and world literatures as well as cultural studies. Scholars and students with interests in creolization, neocolonialism, and globalization will find this work particularly valuable.Patrick Chamoiseau brings the writer's major works of fiction into dialogue with lesser-known texts, including unpublished theatrical works, screenplays, visual texts, and treatises. This holistic, comprehensive, and largely chronological study of Chamoiseau's oeuvre includes analyses of various authorial strategies, especially the use of narrative masques, cross-cultural storytelling techniques, and creolizing poetics""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The sudden and unexpected death of his father, Ber Cowen, Fianna Fail TD for Laois Offaly, thrust a twenty-four year-old Cowen into the heart of Irish politics.After an eight-year apprenticeship on the back benches, Cowen was appointed to his first ministerial position by Albert Reynolds and later went on to hold the senior cabinet positions of Health, Foreign Affairs and Finance. By the time of Bertie Ahern's resignation, Cowen's standing in the party was such that his election to the leadership of Fianna Fail seemed inevitable. On 7 May 2008, Brian Cowen became Ireland's eleventh Taoiseach.Here, for the first time, is a portrait of Brian Cowen which follows his remarkable life story, tracing the road to power from early childhood right up to his eventful early months in the office of An Taoiseach.

From 1972 until the late 1980s IIASA in Austria was one of the very few permanent platforms where policy scientists from both sides of the Cold War divide could work together to articulate and solve world problems. This think tank was a rare zone of freedom, communication, and negotiation, where leading Soviet scientists could try out their innovative ideas, benefit from access to Western literature, and develop social networks, thus paving the way for some of the key science and policy breakthroughs of the twentieth century.Ambitious diplomatic, scientific, and organizational strategies were employed to make this arena for cooperation work for global change. Under the umbrella of the systems approach, East-West scientists co-produced computer simulations of the long-term world future and the anthropogenic impact on the environment, using global modeling to explore the possible effects of climate change and nuclear winter. Their concern with global issues also became a vehicle for transformation inside the Soviet Union. The book shows how computer modeling, cybernetics, and the systems approach challenged Soviet governance by undermining the linear notions of control on which Soviet governance was based and creating new objects and techniques of government.

Does it accelerate progress towards social welfare and human development? Does it generate a peace-dividend and reduce conflict at home? Within the international community, democracy and governance are widely advocated as intrinsically desirable goals. Nevertheless, alternative schools of thought dispute their consequences and the most effective strategy for achieving critical developmental objectives. This book argues that both liberal democracy and state capacity need to be strengthened to ensure effective development, within the constraints posed by structural conditions. Liberal democracy allows citizens to express their demands, hold public officials to account and rid themselves of ineffective leaders. Yet rising public demands that cannot be met by the state generate disillusionment with incumbent officeholders, the regime, or ultimately the promise of liberal democracy ideals. Thus governance capacity also plays a vital role in advancing human security, enabling states to respond effectively to citizen's demands""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Palmer explores the soulful dynamics of American politics. What he did for educators in The Courage to Teach he does for citizens here, exploring the dynamics of our inner lives for clues to reclaiming our national unity. In Healing the Heart of Democracy, he points the way to a politics worthy of the human spirit, rooted in the commonwealth of compassion and creativity still found among ""We the People."" Democracy is a non-stop experiment in the strengths and weaknesses of our political institutions, local communities, and the human heart--its outcome can never be taken for granted. The experiment is endless, unless we blow up the lab, and the explosives to do the job are found within us. But so also is the heart's alchemy that can turn suffering into community, conflict into the energy of creativity, and tension into a force that opens us to the common good. Healing the Heart of Democracy names the vital ""habits of the heart"" we need to do the job and shows how they can be formed. Palmer proposes practical and hopeful, on-the-ground ways to learn how to hold the tensions of our differences in a manner that can restore a government ""of the people, by the people, for the people.""""--Provided by publisher.

The analysis then follows a more or less chronological path, discussing the arguments developed in The New Science of Politics, Voegelin's most famous book, the differentiation of consciousness and the problems of myth and nature as presented in the early volumes of Order and History. Starting in the 1960s, Voegelin began a lengthy argument in several volumes that resumed his concern with the philosophy of consciousness, which he had outlined in his early writings, and its connection to what we conventionally call philosophy of history. Voegelin's late and often difficult essays, lectures, and the final volume of Order and History, many scholars have noticed, emphasize the meditative origins of his political science and, more broadly, of philosophy. The concluding chapters analyze this subject-matter and a perennial question that so many of Voegelin's readers have raised: what is the relation of his political science or philosophy to Christianity?""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Badiou considers how language becomes judgment, which judgments form opinion, how opinions harden into propaganda, and which propaganda becomes the dominant power.

A zero-sum game. Politics as usual. Only the hearty or craven need apply. The political actors have lost sight of the politics of a common good. A Theology of Political Vocation takes up the question of public life precisely where most discussions end. Proving that moral ambiguity does not exclude moral possibility, author John Senior crafts a theology of political vocation not satisfied simply by theologies of sin and grace and philosophical theories of power. For Senior, political theology moves beyond merely staking a claim within a public conversation, a move that prizes discursive skills and aims at consensus concerning shared norms and values. Political theology must offer an account of a political vocation. Senior connects political deliberation to moral judgment, explores use and consequence of power, analyzes political conflict and competition, and limns the ethics of negotiation and compromise. In light of this richer understanding of political vocation, Senior develops theological resources appropriate to a variety of ecologies -- ordinary citizens, political activists, and elected officials. A Theology of Political Vocation shows how Christian politicians can work faithfully within the moral ambiguity of political life to orient their work -- and indeed, their very selves -- toward the common good.

But if there is such a basic minimum, how should this be understood? Dale Dorsey offers an underexplored answer: that the basic minimum should be characterized not as the achievement of a set of capabilities, or as access to some specified bundle of resources, but as the maintenance of a minimal threshold of human welfare. In addition, Dorsey argues that though political institutions should be committed to the promotion of this minimal threshold, we should reject approaches that seek to cast the basic minimum as a human right. His book will be important for all who are interested in theories of political morality""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Why is an unarmed young black woman who knocks on a stranger's front door to ask for help after her car breaks down perceived to be so threatening that the stranger shoots her dead? In Jumping at Shadows, Sasha Abramsky sets his sights on America's most dangerous epidemic: irrational fear. In this meditation on the paralyzing terror Americans feel when confronted with something they don't understand--from foreigners to tropical viruses to universal health care--Abramsky delivers an eye-opening analysis of our misconceptions about risk and threats, and how our brains interpret them, both at a neurological level and at a conscious one. What emerges is a journey through a political and cultural landscape that is defined by our fears, which are often misplaced. Ultimately, Abramsky shows that our fears can teach us a great deal about our society, exposing our deeply ingrained racism, classism, xenophobia, and susceptibility to the toxic messages of demagogues""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

McGuire reports shocking examples of progressive sex-denialism--from American schools, offices, bathrooms, and bedrooms--and reveals the most startling and alarming trend of all: that the frontline victims of our new ""gender-neutral"" world are young women and girls, the very people progressive activists claim to be championing.

Wade identified abortion as a constitutional right 45 years ago, it still bears stigma--a proverbial scarlet A. Millions of Americans have participated in or benefited from an abortion, but few want to reveal that they have done so. Approximately one in five pregnancies in the US ends in abortion. Why is something so common, which has been legal so long, still a source of shame and secrecy? Why is it so regularly debated by politicians, and so seldom divulged from friend to friend? This book explores the personal stigma that prevents many from sharing their abortion experiences with friends and family in private conversation, and the structural stigma that keeps it that way.

Each perspective explores a modern democratic site--courts, classrooms, legislatures, the media, academic professions, and bureaucratic routines. Together, they expose a contradiction--that official constructions of identity treat ""differences"" as both natural characteristics of individuals and the collective basis of interest groups. This contradiction hampers liberal states' efforts to acknowledge and accommodate the cultural diversity of citizens. They also show that official categories do not monopolize the available terms of understanding and identification, given the richness and flexibility of people's self-identifications outside official spheres. This recognition implies an ethnographic project at the heart of democratic change. The book develops two national case studies, the United States and Spain. Both countries have been invoked as models of multiculturalism, but their constitutional discourse and politics take very different approaches to issues of identity. Similarly, ethnographic disciplines have been involved in the officialization of difference in both countries, in different ways. Taken together, these differences and their common roots in the twinned histories of modern liberal democracy and the social sciences, provide ethnographic, reflexive, and comparative themes as well as broader theoretical and practical implications.

With the Millennium Development Declaration of 2000, the international community has agreed to focus on poverty reduction and the reduction of deprivation in its many dimensions.

It is ineffective as a deterrent for crime. It is an instrument the state uses to contain or eliminate its political adversaries. It is a tool of ""justice"" that disproportionality affects religious, social, and racial minorities. It is a sanction that cannot be fixed if unjustly applied. Yet the United States--along with countries notorious for human rights abuse--remains an advocate for the death penalty. In these thirteen pieces, Mario Marazziti exposes the profound inhumanity and irrationality of the death penalty in this country, and urges us to join virtually every other industrialized democracy in rendering capital punishment an abandoned practice belonging to a crueler time in human history. A polemical book, yes, yet one that brings together a wide range of stories to compel the heart as well the mind""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

In order to understand the determinants of poverty and its distribution between and within countries, it is necessary to know its dimensions and the channels through which poverty and inequality affect human well-being. This book analyzes the spatial disparities of the outcomes and determinants of poverty, the interdependencies of dimensions of poverty, the distribution of progress in human development over the population and the dynamics of poverty risk over time. The study takes into account the global spread of poverty. Based on cross-country comparisons of countries from Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, this study does not only consider on average outcomes and determinants of different indicators of human well-being, but also examines their distribution between and within countries.

Besides rising incomes can not distract from the fact that resources to fight global problems remain scarce. These resources have to be devoted to the fight against different global problems like the fight against communicable and non-communicable diseases (especially HIV/AIDS and Malaria) or the fight against global warming. The main precondition to achieve the best results with these limited resources is a good knowledge about the determinants and the best policies to fight each problem. But before being able to analyze the determinants of the different global problems and especially of poverty, it is of fundamental importance to find the right indicators for each phenomenon. This book contributes to the discussion of appropriate poverty indicators for the different dimensions of poverty like income poverty, undernutrition and child mortality and proposes a multidimensional poverty indicator that takes the income distribution into consideration.

How have we coped during this time? Which values have been important? Have we managed to protect the ideals of democracy, openness and humanity? And not least: Who is this """"we"""" that we are referring to?  This scholarly anthology includes articles from researchers associated with the project NECORE (Negotiating Values: Collective Identities and Resilience after 22 July) and other researchers whose work is closely associated with the project. They give us insights, opinions and sharp perspectives on not just 22 July, but also about Norway today, about values, identities and resilience in Norwegian society in the wake of the terror attacks. An important backdrop for the book and the project is the assertion that, as the events themselves recede into the past, it is even more important to focus on what the terror events have led to and how we can learn from them. In a world where terrorism has become an all too common part of political reality, it is crucial that we understand how we ought to think about terror, and how we as a society encounter it.""

Bush describes many of the decisions he made over the years and what inputs he received before making them. It adds enormously to our understanding of the man and his presidency. His broad view is that several Presidents who left office while unpopular (Truman, Reagan) were treated very well by history.  At several critical junctures, Bush relied upon his faith in Jesus Christ to guide his decision-making. He describes his time of coming to understanding about his need for a relationship with Christ during a family discussion with evangelist Billy Graham. His subsequent life seems to display regeneration.  He also plainly credits his decision to forswear the use of alcohol as preceding all of his most important career accomplishments. In the excellent audio version, the reader sounds like the President and makes the experience of listening quite enjoyable. One warning: Mr. Bush uses profanity more often than he should. Other than that, he has produced an excellent, compelling story.

In Stokely, preeminent civil rights scholar Peniel E.

Eleni Kounalakis was forty-three and a land developer in Sacramento, California, when she was tapped by President Barack Obama to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. During her tenure, from 2010 to 2013, Hungary was a key ally in the U.S. military surge, held elections in which a center-right candidate gained a two-thirds supermajority and rewrote the country's constitution, and grappled with the rise of Hungarian nationalism and anti-semitism. The first Greek-American woman ever to serve as a U.S. ambassador, Kounalakis recounts her training at the State Department's 'charm school' and her three years of diplomatic life in Budapest--from protocols about seating, salutations, and embassy security to what to do when the deposed King of Greece hands you a small chocolate crown (eat it, of course!). A cross between a foreign policy memoir and an inspiring personal family story--her immigrant Greek father went from agricultural day laborer to land developer and major Democratic party activist--Madam Ambassador draws back the curtain on what it is like to represent the U.S. government abroad as well as how American embassies around the world function""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES: RESIDENT CHARACTERISTICS AND PUBLIC POLICY,Sharon Anice Baggett,political_science,First published in 1988,/works/OL12265108W,/authors/OL5357349A/Sharon_Anice_Baggett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1988|Pages 325,"Residential care is a rapidly growing form of housing and service provision for older adults. Policy and regulation in this field are only beginning to take shape, and reflect largely a reliance on previous patterns of policy development and regulation in the nursing home industry.  This study examines the characteristics of elderly residential care facility (RCF) residents and examines these through the lens of current state and federal regulations concerning the type of care given in these facilities. It is hypothesized that the lack of knowledge regarding the characteristics of older persons choosing RCF level care contributes to facility design and regulations which may not provide for living environments in which appropriate care and oversight are given.  First, this study examines the factors contributing to the growth of residential care, analyzes federal policy initiatives, and examines the state of Oregon's implementation of the federal initiatives in residential care.  A second research task, to provide information about the characteristics of residential care users, includes an analysis of data collected at three points in time from new residents of an RCF and from a community sample. The data were collected using the Geriatric Assessment Testing and Evaluation System (GATES).  A descriptive analysis of the samples is reported, and a two-way analysis of covariance for a factorial design with equal cell frequencies (25 in each) is used to examine the effects of the two variables, time and place of residence, on the individual and group scores obtained using the GATES.  Primarily, the variables discriminating the RCF consumer from the community sample were found to be: (1) age; (2) number of medications and inability to take them without assistance; (3) continence; (4) mental status; and (5) instrumental activities of daily living.  This study concludes that residential care facilities increasingly provide care for a more impaired, dependent population. Yet current policy reflects a desire to maintain some of the more independent nature of these facilities. Maintaining a balance between imposing regulation and fostering expansion of a needed long term care option is a critical policy issue to be addressed by policy makers and aging advocates concerned with long term care in the coming decades.

A new politics from the left,Hilary Wainwright,political_science,First published in 2018,/works/OL19747566W,/authors/OL709548A/Hilary_Wainwright,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Language English|Pages 146,"""Millions passionately desire a viable alternative to austerity and neoliberalism, but they are sceptical of traditional leftist top-down solutions. In this urgent polemic, Hilary Wainwright argues that this requires a new politics for the left that comes from the bottome up, based on participatory democracy and the everyday knowledge and creativity of each individual. Political leadership should be about facilitation and partnership, not expert domination or paternalistic rule. Wainwright uses lessons from recent movements and experiments to build a radical future vision that will be an inspiration for activists and radicals everywhere.""--Backcover.

On their shields they bore the bloody heart of Robert Bruce, the symbol of their claim to be the physical protectors of the hero-king's legacy. But others saw the power of these lords and earls of Douglas in a different light. To their critics the Douglases were a force for disorder in the kingdom, lawless, arrogant and violent, whose power rested on coercion and whose defiance of kings and guardians ultimately provoked James II into slaying the Douglas earl with his own hand. The Black Douglases examines aristocratic power and status and its place in Scottish political society through the greatest and most notorious magnate dynasty of late medieval Scotland. Michael Brown analyzes the rise and fall of the family as the dominant magnates of the South, from the deeds of the good Sir James Douglas in the service of Bruce to the violent destruction of the Douglas earls in the 1450s. Alongside this study of the accumulation and loss of power by one great noble house, the Black Douglases includes a series of thematic examinations of the nature of aristocratic power. In particular these emphasize the link between warfare and political power in southern Scotland during the 14th century. For the Black Douglases, war was not just a patriotic duty but the means to power and fame in Scotland and across Europe. - Back cover.

In the space of a generation, we have gone from being the best-educated society in the world to one in which a college degree benefits only to those in the top income brackets. In Degrees of Inequality, acclaimed political scientist Suzanne Mettler explains why the system has gone so horribly wrong and why the American Dream is increasingly out of reach for so many. In her eye-opening account, Mettler illuminates how political partisanship has overshadowed America's commitment to equal access to higher education. As politicians capitulate to corporate interests, owners of for-profit colleges benefit, but many of their students gain little aside from massive student loan debt. Meanwhile the nation's public universities have shifted the burden of rising costs onto students, and skyrocketing tuition fees make it increasingly difficult for students to finish their degrees. A comprehensive examination of how politicians have failed our students and our highest ideals as a nation, Degrees of Inequality is clarion call for education reform.

However in recent years there has been a recognition that their shared concerns in areas as diverse as the environment, transnational crime and terrorism, human rights and conflict resolution outweigh their disciplinary and methodological divergences. Law scholars have perhaps discovered the importance of understanding the behavior of actions in the international legal system and international relations scholars have re-discovered that objectives, including normative objectives, might influence choices and condition behavior. This new interest coincides with a general broadening of cross-disciplinary interests into history, sociology, philosophy, psychology, and economics for law and similar developments in international relations. The distinctive rationale for inquiry remains for both fields of study, but the need to move beyond description only in the case of law or analysis only in the case of politics has also fueled a need for new methodologies to understand the changing phenomenon of international life today. This book focuses on collaborative work within the disciplines of international law and international relations, to note sample efforts to collaborate, and to assess the cultivation of an interdisciplinary outlook.""--  ""This book focuses on collaborative work within the disciplines of international law and international relations, to note sample efforts to collaborate, and to assess the cultivation of an interdisciplinary outlook""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

In twenty-five years of imperial adventure, America has laid waste to its principles of democracy. The self-glorifying march of folly steps off at the end of the Cold War, in an era when delusions of omnipotence allowed the market to climb to virtual heights, while society was divided between the selfish and frightened rich and the increasingly debt-ridden and angry poor. The new millennium saw the democratic election of an American president nullified by the Supreme Court, and the pretender launching a wasteful, vainglorious and never-ending war on terror, doomed to end in defeat and the loss of America's prestige abroad. All this culminates in the sunset swamp of the 2016 election--a farce dominated by Donald Trump, a self-glorifying photo-op bursting star-spangled bombast in air. This spectacle would be familiar to Aristotle, whose portrayal of the ""prosperous fool"" describes a class of people who ""consider themselves worthy to hold public office, for they already have the things that give them a claim to office.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It examines the networks of engagement that have shaped relations across three areas: regionalism, non-traditional security, and economic engagement. An understanding of the nature of the Australia-ASEAN partnership is often overshadowed by occasional shocks that test the relationship, such as people smuggling or terrorism, but beneath the surface of these extremes are deep and steady currents of partnership and cooperation that have flowed over four decades. This volume does not seek to merely commemorate or celebrate 40 years of Australia-ASEAN Dialogue Partnership; it is intended to establish a more sophisticated and balanced understanding around which we can accurately identify the Australia-ASEAN dynamic - historically, culturally and theoretically. The volume not only maps where we have been but also where the Australia-ASEAN partnership might be headed as Southeast Asian economic dynamism and strategic influence expand""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Now she's a GLAAD Award-winning journalist happily married to another woman. A lot in her life has changed, but what hasn't changed is her deep love of Red State America, and of queer people who stay in so-called ""flyover country"" rather than moving to the liberal coasts.  In Real Queer America, Allen takes us on a cross-country road-trip stretching all the way from Provo, Utah to the Rio Grande Valley to the Bible Belt to the Deep South. Her motto for the trip: ""Something gay every day."" Making pit stops at drag shows, political rallies, and hubs of queer life across the heartland, she introduces us to scores of extraordinary LGBT people working for change, from the first openly transgender mayor in Texas history to the manager of the only queer night club in Bloomington, Indiana, and many more.  Capturing profound cultural shifts underway in unexpected places and revealing a national network of chosen family fighting for a better world, Real Queer America is a treasure trove of uplifting stories and a much-needed source of hope and inspiration in these divided times.

An expansive investigation of the ways in which a newly-configured right interconnects with anti-democratic and illiberal forces at the level of the state, Europe's Fault Lines provides much-needed answers, revealing some uncomfortable truths. What appear to be ""blind spots"" about far-right extremism on the part of the state, are shown to constitute collusion-as police, intelligence agencies and the military embark on practices of covert policing that bring them into direct or indirect contact with the far right, in ways that bring to mind the darkest days of Europe's authoritarian past. Old racisms may be structured deep in European thought, but they have been revitalized and spun in new ways: the war on terror, the cultural revolution from the right, and the migration-linked demonization of the destitute ""scrounger."" Drawing on her work for the Institute of Race Relations over thirty years, Liz Fekete exposes the fundamental fault lines of racism and authoritarianism in contemporary Europe."" -- Book jacket.

First, it considers how democracy has transformed historically from being one among several plausible forms of government into the only legitimate and publicly defensible regime. Second, it considers how modern democracy attempts to solve what has been called the 'theological-political problem,' that is, the competing claims to rule grounded in conflicting appeals to reason and revelation, by determining that consent of the people would replace divine authorization as the source of political authority.  Understanding the emergence of modern democracy requires examining the manner in which democratic political thinkers, most importantly Benedict Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Jefferson re-conceptualized the traditional understanding of the relation between politics and religion.  This book will show that Spinoza, Rousseau and Jefferson were the three who made the democratic west we know today""--  ""This study examines the three political philosophers that arguably laid the intellectual foundations for contemporary life in the liberal democratic west: Benedict Spinoza, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Jefferson.

In this book, leading Russian and Western political scientists contribute to debates in comparative politics by examining Russia's subnational politics. Beginnings with a chapter that reviews major debates in theory and method, this book continues to examine Russia's 83 regions, exploring a wide range of topics including the nature and stability of authoritarian regimes, federal politics, political parties, ethnic conflict, governance and inequality in a comparative perspective. Providing both qualitative and quantitative data from 20 years of original research, the book draws on elite interaction, public opinion and the role of institutions regionally in the post-Soviet years. The regions vary on a number of theoretically interesting dimensions while their federal membership provides control for other dimensions that are challenging for globally comparative studies. The authors demonstrate the utility of subnational analyses and show how regional questions can help answer a variety of political questions, providing evidence from Russia that can be used by specialists on other large countries or world regions in cross-national scholarship.Situated within broader theoretical and methodological political science debates, this book will be of interest to students and scholars of Russian politics, comparative politics, regionalism and subnational politics""--  ""Subnational political units are growing in influence in national and international affairs, drawing increasing scholarly attention to politics beyond national capitals.

As one young Sandinista commented, 'Rambo is like the Nicaraguan soldier. He's a superman. And if the United States invades, we'll cut the marines down like Rambo did.' And then he mimicked Rambo's famous war howl and mimed his arc of machine gun fire. We both laughed.""—from the book  There is a Nicaragua that Americans have rarely seen or heard about, a nation of jarring political paradoxes and staggering social and cultural flux. In this Nicaragua, the culture of machismo still governs most relationships, insidious racism belies official declarations of ethnic harmony, sexual relationships between men differ starkly from American conceptions of homosexuality, and fascination with all things American is rampant. Roger Lancaster reveals the enduring character of Nicaraguan society as he records the experiences of three families and their community through times of war, hyperinflation, dire shortages, and political turmoil.  Life is hard for the inhabitants of working class barrios like Doña Flora, who expects little from men and who has reared her four children with the help of a constant female companion; and life is hard for Miguel, undersized and vulnerable, stigmatized as a cochón—a ""faggot""—until he learned to fight back against his brutalizers.

However, many open questions remain that will be dealt with in the contributions to this volume. First, the linkages between growth, inequality, and poverty in Latin America need further clarification. More analyses at the country and even sub-national level are required to understand these complex relationships and their most important determinants. Of particular relevance is to examine these relationships in the Latin American context of high economic instability with recurrent economic and financial crises, particularly in the 1990s.

A Magyar politikai fejlődés logikája,Ervin Csizmadia,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL32481480W,/authors/OL8761609A/Ervin_Csizmadia,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Gondolat Kiadó|Language Hungarian|Pages 413,"Amikor A magyar politikai fejlődés logikája című művét írta Csizmadia Ervin, többek között egy barátjával is levelezett, akinek megírta, hogy még egy darabig azért nem tud vele találkozni, mert ezen a könyvön dolgozik. ""Ha bármi logikát és fejlődést látnál a magyar politikában, az meglepne.""--Írta neki az ismerős, és a mondat végére egy smiley jelet tett. Ő pedig (szintén az ismert emotikon kíséretében) azt válaszolta: ezzel a mondatával több év munkáját döntötte romba. Mindazonáltal el is gondolkodtatta a dolog. Vajon nem hiábavaló-e ez a vállalkozás, ami olyasmit akar feltárni, ami talán nincs is? Merthogy van-e egyáltalán fejlődés a magyar politikában, és nem inkább visszafejlődésről beszélhetünk-e, főleg, ha az utóbbi évtizedet nézzük? De persze nézhetünk nagyobb időtávot is, s ha így tesszük, olyan klasszikusokkal találkozunk, akik ""zsákutcásnak"" (Bibó István) vagy ""útvesztőnek"" (Szekfű Gyula) nevezik a magyar történelmet. De mi van, ha ezek túlzó kifejezések? Ha mégiscsak van valamiféle fejlődés? S ha igen, az miben nyilvánul meg? Mi fejlődik és milyen logikában? Egyáltalán: hogyan értelmezhető a ""politikai fejlődés"" jelzős szerkezet? Ezekre a kérdésekre is igyekszik válaszolni könyvében a szerző, ám rögtön az első oldalon leírja: műve egy állásfoglalás is. Állásfoglalás amellett, hogy a magyar politikát, úgy általában, ne hanyatlónak, zsákutcásnak, torznak stb. nevezzük, hanem normálisnak, olyannak, mint amilyen más - általunk normálisnak tekintett - országokban a politika. Ehhez azonban történeti szemléletre van szükség, állítja a szerző, s könyvében a maga történeti nézőpontjából igyekszik felvázolni a magyar politikai fejlődés logikáját.  Olyan kérdéseket érint, mint Thomas Kuhn paradigmaelmélete és a (történelem-jelen) paradigmák váltógazdaságának logikája, az elmúlt évtizedek meghatározó politikatudományi-ideológiai paradigmái (politikai fejlődés, tranzitológia, új historicizmus/új politikai fejlődés), vagy a jelencentrikus megközelítések irányai és tematikái Magyarországon. A szerző bemutatja a magyar fejlődés deformálódásának történeti elméletét Bibónál, a magyar és az angol parlamentarizmus összehasonlítását Kun József egy 1909-es tanulmánya alapján, a magyar pártosodás történeti hullámait a reformkortól az 1930-as évekig, a Fidesz jobbratolódásáról és radikalizálódásáról szóló politikai és tudományos kritikákat 2006 és 2017 között, a magyar jobboldal és Orbán Viktor Európa-felfogásának átalakulását, vagy a sokpártrendszer felől a domináns pártrendszer felé való elmozdulást. A végén a szerző az orbánizmust, mint a magyar politikai fejlődés logikájából fakadó következményt vezeti le. A vélhetően komoly szakmai visszhangot, vitákat is kiváltó kötet bibliográfiával és névmutatóval zárul. ""www.kello.hu  minden jog fenntartva.""

Analisa-se, igualmente, mediante incursões analítico-normativas, a problemática da estatalidade em África, procurando lançar miradas sobre as heranças pré-coloniais, coloniais, o período após as independências e os desenvolvimentos contemporâneos, nomeadamente, no campo da Sociedade Internacional e das Éticas Internacionais, que contribuem para que, tal como em outras partes do globo, este continente tenha as principais características da sua estatalidade caldeadas na sua história tanto milenar como recente. Este trabalho engloba, por fim, uma análise embrionária do caso cabo-verdiano. A escolha deste Estado prende-se fundamentalmente com facto de apresentar-se com a seguinte singularidade: por um lado, constatou-se que as características que encerra provam a inadequação da abordagem hegemónica na catalogação de determinados Estados como sendo «frágeis», «falhados» ou «colapsados». Por outro, demonstra-se que o seu percurso pós-colonial - considerado, por exemplo, pelas principais instituições internacionais como sendo de relativo sucesso em termos do que se convencionou chamar-se de governação - deve-se principalmente ao facto da solução estatal adoptada ter-se mostrado para a sua elite dirigente, tal como ocorreu em outros casos, como a melhor via a seguir, enquadrando-se na abordagem normativa inovadora que se propõe aqui para a análise desse tipo de casos.""--Back cover.

El recorrido por su antología pone de manifiesto al lector la unidad indisoluble entre su obra y los avatares de la política y las sociedades latinoamericanas de las últimas cinco décadas. Su trabajo nos muestra con claridad los principales ejes de reflexión de las ciencias sociales y, en particular, de la sociología política de los últimos cincuenta años, lo que da cuenta del amplio diálogo continental contenido en sus investigaciones.  Su obra refleja el compromiso político e intelectual con los diversos movimientos sociales y políticos que durante estas décadas han defendido los intereses de los sectores más vulnerables y excluidos de América Latina. Desde sus primeros escritos hasta hoy, una de sus mayores preocupaciones ha sido tratar de comprender en profundidad cómo se establecen y se trasforman las relaciones de poder en una sociedad concreta, para poder encontrar el lugar desde donde impulsar alternativas de cambio que fortalezcan la equidad y la democracia.""--Page 4 of cover.

Os dez anos precedentes caracterizam-se pela virtual impossibilidade de governar - no sentido próprio do termo - diante da disseminação pelo país da guerra civil e das sucessivas insurreições militares. Diante do quadro, os governos instauram o desrespeito à imunidade parlamentar, recorrem ao exílio de personalidades, tudo culminando, sob o primeiro governo civil, na prisão de deputados""--Aparesentação, Antonio Paim, p. 7.

Der Band, der die gleichnamige Ausstellung des Deutschen Historischen Museums begleitet, folgt ihrem Blick auf das Zeitalter totaler Herrschaft, Antisemitismus, die Lage von Flüchtlingen, die Erblasten der Nachkriegszeit, den Eichmann-Prozess, das politische System und die Rassentrennung in den USA, Zionismus, Feminismus und Studentenbewegung.0Mit Beiträgen von Stefan Auer, Felix Axster, Susanne Baer, Roger Berkowitz, Micha Brumlik, Claudia Christophersen, Astrid Deuber-Mankowsky, Wolfram Eilenberger, Norbert Frei, Antonia Grunenberg, Barbara Hahn, Marie Luise Knott, Jerome Kohn, Marcus Llanque, Ursula Ludz, Thomas Meyer, Susan Neiman, Ingeborg Nordmann, Anna Pollmann, Milo Rau, Werner Renz, Antje Schrupp, Chana Schütz, Liliane Weissberg.00Exhibition: Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin, Germany ( 27.03. - 18.10.2020).

His research into nineteenth-century workers’ archives, reflections on political equality, critique of the traditional division between intellectual and manual labor, and analysis of the place of literature, film, and art in modern society have all constituted major contributions to contemporary thought. In this collection, leading scholars in the fields of philosophy, literary theory, and cultural criticism engage Rancière’s work, illuminating its originality, breadth, and rigor, as well as its place in current debates. They also explore the relationships between Rancière and the various authors and artists he has analyzed, ranging from Plato and Aristotle to Flaubert, Rossellini, Auerbach, Bourdieu, and Deleuze.

They rely on fear to keep and expand their privileges and control the masses. In the current crisis of the capitalist world system, elites in the United States, along with other central countries, promote fear of crime and terrorism.

On the History of Political Philosophy: Great Political Thinkers from Thucydides to Locke,W. Julian Korab-Karpowicz,political_science,First published in 2012,/works/OL16094373W,/authors/OL3445138A/W._Julian_Korab-Karpowicz,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24990292M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Pearson|Language English,"On the History of Political Philosophy: Great Political Thinkers from Thucydides to Locke is a lively and lucid account of the major political theorists and philosophers of the ancient Greek, Roman, medieval, renaissance, and early modern periods. The author demonstrates the continuing significance of some political debates and problems that originated in the history of political philosophy. Topics include discussions concerning human nature, different views of justice, the origin of government and law, the rise and development of different forms of government, idealism and realism in international relations, the distinction between just and unjust war, and the sources of public authority and the nature of legitimate sovereignty. The organizing principle of the book is the idea that the great political thinkers were searching for the best political order and a criterion for human conduct in both domestic and international politics. The book presupposes no previous knowledge of political philosophy. It will therefore be a valuable introductory book for students of philosophy, politics, and international relations. As it opens eyes to the perceptions that historical knowledge may convey, it will also be an illuminating and engaging reading for a general reader.

The authors present American political institutions, such as the presidency, Congress, and the Supreme Court, how the average American participates in Government by covering topics such as voting, public opinion, and the media. They explore why Americans seem to have increasing dissatisfaction with their government and attempt to explore the role that you as U.S. citizens and residents can take in improving democracy in America.

Al convertir a éste en la gran palanca de la transformación, la política revolucionaria se constituyó como conquista de aquel lugar fabulado del «poder concentrado», hasta el punto de agotarse. De hecho, si hoy la palabra revolución ha perdido todo contenido político sustantivo, se ha banalizado tanto, conviene preguntarse si esto no se debe a esta estrecha relación entre política y Estado.  En este libro se propone una inversión del juego. Dejar de pensar la política con relación al poder de Estado. Y empezar a pensarla como fundación de un poder o poderes propios. La política así constituida se confirma como autodeterminación de la colectividad social. Desde esta perspectiva, la estrategia se desplaza de la insistencia en la conquista del Estado a la génesis de un nuevo archipiélago de contrapoderes. Más preocupada por su afirmación que por su inscripción y asimilación en las instituciones del Estado, esta política se articula desde una inflexible unilateralidad: es, por eso, «política de parte».

Negotiated Power,Sukhee Lee,political_science,First published in 2009,/works/OL21084945W,/authors/OL8066808A/Sukhee_Lee,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Language English|Pages 256,"My dissertation explores how a new relationship between the state and society was formed in twelfth-fourteenth century China. Taking Mingzhou, modern Ningbo city, Zhejiang Province, as my case study, I challenge the assumption on which many interpretations of this period are based, namely a zero-sum competition between state power and that of local elites. Rather than asking a counter-productive question of ""whether the late imperial Chinese state was strong or weak"" vis-à-vis local elites, I orient my research toward an analysis of continual negotiation between them and what their voices tell us about the period. I have found that the presence of the state, not its absence, was essential to the rise of local elite society. Chapter One examines who the main actors were in the remarkable growth of Mingzhou during the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), and what made them different from elites in other localities, chiefly the elites of Fuzhou, Jiangxi, upon whom our understanding of Southern Song social elites has been largely based. Drawing mainly on 140 epitaphs written for Mingzhou natives, I argue that a flourishing elite community in Southern Song Mingzhou was an outcome of the connectedness of its elite to the state, not of their separation from it.  n Chapter Two, I argue that the local government in Southern Song showed a notable resiliency and administrative competence. Far from helpless, the local state managed to find a way to continue to be a reliable gatekeeper of society in terms of local defense and infrastructure building. Based on a close reading of the way in which policies of the Mingzhou government were worked out, I also show that the local government was actively negotiating with local people and did not lose its substantial leverage in this process well into the 1250s. Rather than seeing these facts as simple proof of the relative weakening of state power, I interpret them as a sign that the local state began to view itself as a participant in and caretaker of local society, not simply as its ruler. Chapter Three starts with a question: in what fields can we find so-called ""elite activism""? From this perspective, building and renovating local schools, reviving an ancient community ritual, creating a self-help institution, and organizing a voluntary association to cope with state imposed duty are all examined. Local community building was not dominated, let alone monopolized, by local elites. The Mingzhou government was enthusiastic about sustaining local community by becoming a financial supporter, administrative manager, and timely reformer of various local projects. The rise of local activism during the Southern Song period, I argue, was undergirded by an activism of local government. In Chapter Four, I turn to what happened to Mingzhou society and its elites during the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). In the absence of the examination system, arguably the most significant institutional link connecting local elites with the state, how did local elites make sense of themselves and the state?  How did the seeds of localism planted during Southern Song grow under the alien regime? In answering these questions, I show the crucial importance of the Yuan period in shaping local elite society and handing it over to the late imperial period.

Based on exclusive interviews, inside sources, and never-before-published material, Leading from Behind reveals a president who is indecisive, moody, and often paralyzed by competing political considerations. Many victories during the Obama presidency are revealed to be the work of strong women, negotiating behind the scenes as well as exercising leadership when the president did not: then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who spearheaded key domestic initiatives; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose tireless diplomacy guided America through a seemingly-endless sequence of controversial and delicate international events; and Valerie Jarrett, his closest advisor and an Obama family confidante, whose unusual degree of influence has been a source of conflict with more seasoned political insiders. In Leading From Behind, Richard Miniter's provocative research offers a dramatic, thoroughly-sourced account of President Obama and his White House during a time of domestic controversy and international turmoil""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary,Voltaire,political_science,First published in 2011,/works/OL16102102W,/authors/OL32293A/Voltaire,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24997195M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English,"Here is the only available English translation of one of the landmarks of European Enlightenment thought, Voltaire's 1764 edition of A Pocket Philosophical Dictionary. Highly entertaining and still highly relevant, the ""dictionary"" actually consists of a sequence of short essays, arranged in alphabetical order, covering everything from Apocalypse and Atheism to Tolerance and Tyranny. The unifying thread of these articles is Voltaire's vitriolic critique of established religion: ridicule of established dogma, attacks on superstition, and pleas for toleration. Witty and ironic, this is very much a work of combat, part of Voltaire's high-profile political struggle in the 1760s to defend the victims of religious and political intolerance. This new translation is based on the definitive French edition of 1764 that provoked widespread controversy and condemnation. In his Introduction Nicholas Cronk considers the nature of Voltaire's engagement in political debate, literary style, contemporary reaction, the lasting impact of the work and its continuing relevance to debates on religious intolerance. The volume also includes an up-to-date bibliography and full explanatory notes. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With renewed interest in pragmatism and its implications for democracy in an age of mass communication, bureaucracy, and ever-increasing social complexities, Dewey's The Public and Its Problems, first published in 1927, remains vital to any discussion of today's political issues. This edition of The Public and Its Problems, meticulously annotated and interpreted with fresh insight by Melvin L. Rogers, radically updates the previous version published by Swallow Press. Rogers's introduction locates Dewey's work within its philosophical and historical context and explains its key ideas for a contemporary readership.

The agreement and its negotiation have become a cornerstone of diplomatic law. A Cornerstone of Modern Diplomacy, which is based on archival research in the National Archives (London), the Austrian State Archives (Vienna) and the Political Archive (Berlin), delivers the first study of the British policy during the negotiation of the key convention governing diplomatic privileges and immunities: the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The book provides a complete commentary on the political aspects of the codification process of diplomatic law. By clearly presenting the case with accessible analysis, author Kai Bruns makes the relations between international law and politics understandable, stressing the impact of the emergence of the third world in UN diplomacy. This unique study is a crucial piece of scholarship, shedding light on the practice of United Nations conference diplomacy and the codification of diplomatic law at the height of the Cold War""-- $c Provided by publisher.

Bush, and usher in a new era of a global, interconnected world. More than two years have passed since his inauguration, and the reality of President Obama's approach is in stark contrast to the ebullient and optimistic image that he originally built up. In fact, Obama is not committed to redefining U.S. foreign policy in a transformational way, but to calibrating and correcting the Bush policies, and reclaiming the neorealist approach that defined America's foreign policy since WWII. Taking stock of Obama's first year in the White House, this book places his engagement in the Middle East within the broader context of U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 and examines key areas that have posed a challenge to his administration. Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges highlights the administration's widening credibility gap and lack of resolve and political will to directly confront policy challenges head-on, and offer essential strategic recommendations for advancing U.S. relations with the Muslim world""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Politics of Preferential Development,Steven Ratuva,political_science,First published in 2013,/works/OL20932933W,/authors/OL6299258A/Steven_Ratuva,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  ANU Press,"The book is a critical examination of affirmative action, a form of preferential development often used to address the situation of disadvantaged groups. It uses a trans-global approach, as opposed to the comparative approach, to examine the relationship between affirmative action, ethnic conflict and the role of the state in Fiji, Malaysia and South Africa. While affirmative action has noble goals, there are often intervening political and ideological factors in the form of ethno-nationalism and elite interests, amongst others, which potentially undermine fair distribution of affirmative action resources. The book examines the affirmative action philosophies and programs of the three countries and raises pertinent questions about whether affirmative action has led to equality, social justice, harmony and political stability and explores future possibilities. “Steven Ratuva provides a brilliant critical study, not just of affirmative action policy and practice in three very different postcolonial contexts, but of the very complex matters of principle, justification and ideology that are involved more generally. It is an invaluable contribution to the literature on this important topic.”         Dr Stephanie Lawson, Professor of Politics and International Relations, Macquarie University.    “Scholarly and provocative, Steven Ratuva’s Politics of Preferential Development is an original and insightful comparative contribution to the growing literature on affirmative action around the world.”         Dr Ralph Premdas, Professor of Public Policy, University of West Indies; Former Professor, University of California Berkeley and University of Toronto.

""The leading contributors reveal that good governance is about governments getting the advice that they need to hear as well as the advice that they want to hear. They highlight the importance of ensuring that the advice is appropriately responsive to the policy priorities of the government of the day. In countries such as the United States, and in some European democracies, political appointments to senior administrative positions are not a new development. However, in recent years a third element - the political adviser - has also become a feature of policy-making and political management in Westminster-styled systems. This authoritative work seeks to illuminate the drivers behind the advent of political staff in executive government, and the consequences for policy-making and governance. This unique book includes case studies from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States."" ""Academics and postgraduates researching in public administration and management as well as political science will find this book invaluable. Policymakers in agencies responsible for public service leadership will also find much to interest them in this important book.""--BOOK JACKET.

Rose--a visionary in urban development and renewal--champions the role of cities in addressing the environmental, economic, and social challenges of the 21st century. Cities are birthplaces of civilization; centers of culture, trade, and progress; cauldrons of opportunity--and by 2080 will be home to 80% of the world's population. As the 21st century progresses, metropolitan areas will bear the brunt of global megatrends such as climate change, natural resource depletion, population growth, income inequality, mass migration, and education and health disparity, among many others. ln this book, Jonathan F.P. Rose--the man who ""repairs the fabric of cities""--distills a lifetime of interdisciplinary research and firsthand experience into a five-pronged model for designing and reshaping cities with the goal of equalizing their landscape of opportunity. Drawing from the musical concept of ""temperament,"" Rose argues that well-tempered cities can be infused with systems that bend the arc of their development toward equality, resilience, adaptability, and well-being, to achieve ever-unfolding harmony between civilization and nature. While these goals may never be fully attained, it we at least aspire to them, and approach every plan and constructive step with this intention, our cities will be richer and happier. A celebration of the city and an impassioned argument for its role in addressing important issues in these volatile times, The Well-Tempered City is a well-reasoned, hopeful blueprint for a thriving metropolis--and the future.--From dust jacket.

For much of the twentieth century, however, it was better known as the 'Catalan Manchester', the 'city of the bombs' and 'rose of fire'. This reflected both its importance as the leading industrial centre of the Mediterranean and its revolutionary traditions, particularly the importance of anarchism within its labour movement. Interest has often focused on the barricades and revolts of 'Picasso's Barcelona' at the turn of the century and the great social revolution unleashed by the Civil War and chronicled by George Orwell. This book explores this 'red' or 'red and black' heritage, and how it has been transformed as the century has progressed.As one of Europe's great industrial and revolutionary centres Barcelona has been in need of a detailed social and cultural history, yet there is actually a paucity of detailed research. This book redresses the balance. Focusing on the entire twentieth century, it allows for the emergence of long-term trends, and deals with both classic and newer themes of labour history, such as: Transformations within the labour process The development of and splits within the organised labour movement Gender and labour The relationship between 'popular' and working-class protest, and labour and nationalismThis novel and authoritative work will interest not only those working on Spain, but all scholars and students of comparative history.

Here he explores this terrain from a different angle in essays that deftly counterpoise the personal and the political, and are shot through with the same passion, imagination, and breathtaking shifts of perspective that gives his fiction its unmistakable electric charge. A ""water lily"" who has called three countries on three continents his home-Pakistan, the birthplace to which he returned as a young father; the United States, where he spent his childhood and young adulthood; and Britain, where he married and became a citizen-Hamid writes about overlapping worlds with fluidity and penetrating insight. Whether he is discussing courtship rituals or pop culture, drones or the rhythms of daily life in an extended family compound, he transports us beyond the scarifying headlines of an anxious West and a volatile East, beyond stereotype and assumption, and helps to bring a dazzling diverse global culture within emotional and intellectual reach.""--  ""From the bestselling author of How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, an intimate and sharply observed commentary-in-essays on life, art, politics, and ""the war on terror.""""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

No Hope is for disaffected conservatives and moderates as well as liberals who are fed up with the political party system. Forty-three percent of Americans now identify as Independents. Many of them are right of center and used to be Republicans. In No Hope, former Republican Jimmy LaSalvia, cofounder of GOProud, which was one of the highest-profile gay political organizations, will share what he did to ignite change in the Republican Party. But ultimately LaSalvia determined there was no hope that conservatives would evolve on important cultural issues-revealing the party as an untenable coalition that includes the tolerance of bigotry. No Hope chronicles Jimmy's evolution from team-player Republican to free-thinking Independent and includes entertaining stories and anecdotes about some of the biggest names in politics today, including Donald Trump, Ann Coulter, Roger Ailes, Reince Priebus, Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, and others. No Hope also exposes some of the ugliest anti-gay operators in Washington, DC. In early 2014, Jimmy announced his resignation from the Republican Party and changed his voter registration to join the new majority of Independent voters, receiving significant media attention. Now, in No Hope, he tells all and, in the most entertaining outing in political book history, breaks apart the current two-party system to energize democracy""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book synthesizes insights from different scholarly approaches and offers an original interpretation of the knowledge accumulated in the field. Goran Hyden discusses how research on African politics relates to the study of politics in other regions and mainstream theories in comparative politics. He focuses on such key issues as why politics trumps economics, rule is personal, state is weak and policies are made with a communal rather than an individual lens. The book also discusses why in the light of these conditions agriculture is problematic, gender contested, ethnicity manipulated and relations with Western powers a matter of defiance""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On Stalin's Team overturns this view, revealing that behind Stalin were a group of loyal men who formed a remarkably effective team with him from the late 1920s until his death in 1953. Drawing on extensive original research, Sheila Fitzpatrick provides the first in-depth account of this inner circle and their families, vividly describing how these dedicated comrades-in-arms not only worked closely with Stalin, whom they both feared and admired, but also constituted his social circle. Readers meet the wily security chief Beria, whom the rest of the team quickly had executed following Stalin's death; Stalin's number-two man, Molotov, who continued on the team even after his wife was arrested and exiled; the charismatic Ordzhonikidze, who ran the country's industry with entrepreneurial flair; Andreev, who traveled to provincial purges while listening to Beethoven on a portable gramophone; and Khrushchev, who finally disbanded the team four years after Stalin's death. Among the book's surprising findings is that Stalin almost always worked with the team on important issues, and after his death the team managed a brilliant transition to a reforming collective leadership. Taking readers from the cataclysms of the Great Purges and World War II to the paranoia of Stalin's final years, On Stalin's Team paints an entirely new picture of Stalin within his milieu--one that transforms our understanding of how the Soviet Union was ruled during much of its existence""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book will help shed light on what social and political scholars in Asia and the Pacific have done in terms of research and knowledge development, as well as the new frontiers of research that have been explored and opening up, which can connect the two regions with the rest of the globe.

One of the most at-risk populations for contracting AIDS is intravenous drug users. Traditionally, government has responded to major health threats by implementing programs directed toward prevention and treatment. Although needle exchange programs are effective in changing risk behaviors, most programs in the United States are not legally sanctioned. Eleven states have laws that prohibit sale or possession of drug related equipment without a prescription. There are legal exchange programs in other countries. This study examined three needle exchange programs to determine barriers and facilitators of program implementation.  The organizing framework for the study was John Kingdon's garbage can model of policy implementation. A qualitative design used interviews and participant observation. The researcher interviewed forty-one policy makers and service providers and several individuals and groups of clients from three different needle exchange programs in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, New York City, and Tacoma, Washington. Data analysis revealed several emergent themes and a program design that was unique to each of the programs. Barriers and facilitators to implementation in all of the programs were determined. A new model of program implementation was identified in the Tacoma program.  Policy implementation theory is advanced by supporting Kingdon's model and by raising additional questions for future research. Facilitators and barriers are identified and are available to policy makers to consider in planning and implementing needle exchange programs.

Stacey, who grew up in a working poor family in Gulfport, Mississippi, rose from humble roots to Yale Law School, and through a career in C-suite businesses, to become the first woman to lead either party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African American to lead in the House of Representatives. In Minority Leader, Stacey combines aspects of memoir with real-world advice for women and people of color, offering hard-won insights for navigating worlds that, until now, were largely the territory of white men alone. Stacey encourages her readers both to leverage otherness to their advantage and to recognize their own underlying feelings of unworthiness and legitimate fears. Sure, networking helps, but so do well-chosen mentors, thoughtful self-advocacy, and, above all, pinpointing one's genuine passions. Stacey applies her lessons to the recent graduate taking her big idea to the startup level, the Latino city councilman eyeing the mayor's office, and the young assistant navigating her way to a higher position. There is precious little such wisdom out there. Stacey is determined to change that.""--Provided by publisher.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

But behind the officially approved story is a different reality. Preparing this book Gerard Lemos asked hundreds of Chinese men and women living in Chongqing, an industrial mega-city, about their wishes and fears. The lives they describe expose the myth of China's harmonious society. Hundreds of millions of everyday people in China are beleaguered by immense social and health problems as well as personal, family, and financial anxieties--while they watch their communities and traditions being destroyed.Lemos investigates a China beyond the foreigners' beaten track. This is a revealing account of the thoughts and feelings of Chinese people regarding all facets of their lives, from education to health care, unemployment to old age, politics to wealth. Taken together, the stories of these men and women bring to light a broken society, one whose people are frustrated, angry, sad, and often fearful about the circumstances of their lives. The author considers the implications of these findings and analyzes how China's community and social problems threaten the ambitious nation's hopes for a prosperous and cohesive future. Lemos explains why protests will continue and a divided and self-serving leadership will not make people's dreams come true""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Climate Terror,Sanjay Chaturvedi,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL20726403W,/authors/OL454585A/Sanjay_Chaturvedi,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28030032M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2015|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English|Pages 247,"""Climate Terror investigates the highly differentiated geographical politics of global warming. It explores how fear-inducing climate change discourses could result in new forms of dependencies, domination and militarised 'climate security'. In this revealing study from Doyle and Chaturvedi, the concept of environmental security is brought to life through cases of the most pressing environmental issues confronting the Global South, which are creating desperate realities for billions of people. The book proposes the following key questions, crucial to our understanding of this issue: Can the climate discourse be re-configured to provide a place where issues of environmental justice and sovereignty are paramount, rather than neo-liberal responses to climate? Can climate change give a voice to the global periphery, and can it be used as a vehicle for emancipation?  Doyle and Chaturvedi's study concludes by taking note of the more optimistic response of 'emancipatory' groups and networks to concepts such as climate justice and climate debt, and the ways in which these groups have attempted to use this global climate moment for more democratic purposes. Is the climate story, regardless of its diverse intentions, a discourse now captured by the affluent North to control the development of the Global South? Has the emancipatory moment now passed or is there still hope for the re-emergence of subaltern perspectives on climate futures? The authors further discuss the deployment of terror vocabulary to address climate change, which is a part of refurbished designs and technologies of control, regulation and domination in a neo-liberal, post-political globalised world marked by profound asymmetries in terms of economic growth and human development. They argue for an increased understanding of the environment, not as an external enemy force, but as a diverse nature that is inclusive of people, a nature that has the potential to provide secure access to citizens of all countries to basic nutrition, adequate access to health, appropriate shelter, and a security to practice a diverse range of livelihoods.

Catie Snow Bailard seeks to determine the Internet's influence on citizens' evaluations of their governments' performance, particularly whether the Internet influences their satisfaction regarding the quality of democratic practices available in their nation. While it is clearly important to understand how the Internet can streamline political organization once people are moved to action, the discipline has afforded less attention to whether the Internet influences citizens at this more foundational, antecedent stage of political action. Bailard originates two theories for democratization specialists to consider: mirror-holding and window-opening. Mirror-holding explores how accessing the Internet allows citizens to see a more detailed and nuanced view of their own government's performance, dirty laundry and all. Window-opening, on the other hand, enables those same citizens to see how other governments' perform in general, particularly in comparison to their own. The author offers a theory of the impact of Internet use on evaluations of government, as well as tests of that theory at the country and individual levels based on survey data collected in 73 countries and two field experiments conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Tanzania""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

For today's teenagers and young adults, years of ineffective and inefficient political leadership have completely eroded any sense that politicians or government have the ability to do good or effect positive change. Worse, the mean-spirited, dysfunctional political system that has come to characterize American politics has turned young people off to the idea of running for office. With more than 500,000 elected positions in the United States, what will happen when this generation is expected to take the reins of political power? Through an original, national survey of more than 4,000 high school and college students, as well as more than 100 in-depth interviews, Jennifer L. Lawless and Richard L. Fox find that young Americans feel completely alienated from contemporary politics and express little ambition or aspiration to run for office in the future. The overwhelming majority see nothing particularly noble about those currently in office, viewing most as dishonest, self-interested, and disinterested in helping their constituents. These young people want to improve their communities and enact change in the world; but they don't think politics is the way to achieve these goals. In fact, they look disdainfully upon the prospects of growing up to be a mayor, governor, senator, or even president of the United States. Running from Office explores young people's opinions about contemporary politics and their political ambition (or lack of it). The book paints a political profile of the next generation that should sound alarm bells about the long-term, deeply embedded damage contemporary politics has wrought on U.S. democracy and its youngest citizens. As disheartening as their conclusions sound, Lawless and Fox end with practical suggestions for how new technologies, national service programs, and well-strategized public service campaigns could generate political ambition in young people. Today's high school and college students care deeply about improving the future, and it's not too late to ensure that they view running for office as an effective way to do so""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

NURSING WAR: A PHILOSOPHICAL STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROFESSION OF NURSING AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE,Linda Bergstrom,political_science,First published in 1992,/works/OL12273432W,/authors/OL5363902A/Linda_Bergstrom,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1992|Pages 319,"The purpose of this study is to examine critically, using philosophical methods and interpretive prose, the relationship between the nursing profession and the phenomenon of political violence. Nursing history is intimately tied to wars, and while many nurse researchers have studied nurses' experiences in particular wars, no one has yet studied the nature of nursing's interactions with war.  Published personal accounts of nurses who served in World War I were used to describe the experience of war nursing. The generated description of war nursing was regarded as a description of nursing in any war. This experience included a personal transformation; the nurses began as young, enthusiastic and naive, and ended feeling old, tired, and cynical, especially cynical about war itself. The personal accounts were explored further to describe the meaning of the experience of war nursing. Four themes involving contrasts and irony were identified; taken together these themes showed the experience of war nursing to be morally conflictual in nature. The idea that nurses' participation in war fostered perpetuation of war itself was developed.  The profession's political responses to war was described. A historical survey of twentieth century wars demonstrated how the organized profession has generally supported and facilitated war efforts. Minority voices within the profession, nurses who opposed war supporting activities, were identified and explored.  Selected theoretical concepts in common usage within the profession were described to demonstrate that political violence is a phenomenon that can be identified as compelling attention by nursing, but that to date this concept has not been developed by nursing scholars or theorists. The moral delimma inherent in nursing during wartime was also identified from an examination of nursing's ethical codes juxaposed against the realities of political violence.  Taken together the themes explored in this study identified an emerging need for the profession of nursing to pay attention to the phenomenon of political violence in general, and to engage in deliberate, widespread, public discussion on the topic as a first step towards actions designed to resolve the moral dilemma inherent in the relationship between nursing and political violence.

STATE VARIATION IN MEDICAID SPENDING ON NURSING FACILITY CARE AND THE IMPACT OF OBRA 1987,Joan Lynn Exline,political_science,First published in 1996,/works/OL12281513W,/authors/OL5370589A/Joan_Lynn_Exline,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1996|Pages 69,"This dissertation provides insights into patterns of state policymaking regarding spending on nursing facility care for elderly Medicaid recipients. It examines economic and political sources of state variation in this policy area, and assesses the impact of the federal legislation (OBRA 1987) that was intended to improve the aggregate quality of nursing home care.  Medicaid nursing facility spending per recipient, adjusted for the differences in medical input prices, is a function of interest group system power, interparty competition and tax effort. Federal legislation intended to improve the quality of care diminishes the impact of these political and economic factors across states. Cross-sectional and pretest-posttest research designs and robust regression techniques are used to analyze data from time periods before and after the implementation of OBRA 1987. The pretest period is 1984-1986 and the posttest period is 1991-1993.  Several conclusions are suggested. From an economic perspective, states that are more willing and able to tax themselves have more resources for social welfare programs, like Medicaid nursing facility care. The more dominant the influence of interest groups on state policymaking, the less states spend on nursing facility care, controlling for interparty competition and tax effort. When interest groups are dominant over other political institutions, advocacy groups for Medicaid nursing facility care do not fare as well in the competition with other interest groups as they do in states where there is more balance in the power between interest groups and other political institutions. Moreover, when there is closer competition between state political parties, Medicaid nursing facility programs benefit as the conditions of competition provide elected officials with incentives to support more generous social policies. Finally, federal legislation intended to improve the aggregate quality of nursing homes diminished the effect of political and economic variables that facilitate state variation.

A POLICY PROCESS MODEL: ANALYSIS OF THE NURSE EDUCATION ACT OF 1991-1992,Bethany Ann Hall-Long,political_science,First published in 1993,/works/OL12273994W,/authors/OL5364378A/Bethany_Ann_Hall-Long,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1993|Pages 203,"The purpose of this exploratory case study was to examine an investigator-developed public policy process model. The Tri-Council For Nursing's political efforts during the 1991-1992 reauthorization of the Nurse Education Act served as an exemplary case to initiate the exploration of the model. Primary data were collected via a researcher designed questionnaire and interview guide that operationalized the policy process model. A purposive sample of 15 members of the Tri-Council For Nursing, U.S. Division of Nursing, and U.S. congressional staff completed the questionnaire and were interviewed. More than 75 public documents and records were reviewed as secondary sources of data. Data examination included nonparametric statistical analyses of numerical data and content analysis of categorical data, using the conceptual schema of the policy process model as a guide.  The findings supported the conceptual categories and organization of the policy process model. This first case exploration advanced the model's ability to discern perceptual differences among political actors efforts and corresponding policy stages. For instance, significant differences between government and Tri-Council For Nursing respondents' perceptions of the policy priorities and the frequency, effectiveness, and type of political efforts used by the Tri-Council For Nursing were readily deduced. Thematic findings from the content analysis revealed how the Tri-Council For Nursing shifted from using proactive and intradependent efforts during the initial agenda-setting phase of the NEA's reauthorization to mostly reactive and independent efforts for the remainder of the policy process. The Tri-Council For Nursing used different political strategies throughout the process, but were greatest in number during agenda setting. Other findings relative to the case's political points of contact, policy conflict areas, majority support building techniques, and forecasted roles with the NEA's implementation and evaluation were discerned.  Implications for future development of the policy process model and areas for expanded investigation of the exemplary case of the Tri-Council For Nursing were given.

Imperialism past and present,Emanuele Saccarelli,political_science,First published in 2015,/works/OL20043254W,/authors/OL6721638A/Emanuele_Saccarelli,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2015|Language English|Pages 256,"""After a long hiatus, when it was seemingly banished to the wilderness of esoteric academic debate, imperialism is back as one of the buzzwords of the day. In the past decade in particular, scholars, policy-makers and political pundits have been using the term with increasing frequency in their commentary on contemporary international relations. Many have invoked it as an old specter only to nervously deny its contemporary applicability. Meanwhile, the term has continued to be applied to a diverse range of economic, political, cultural and linguistic phenomena. The sudden popularity of the term has created confusion about what it means and why we should care about it. Regardless of whether it is used as an invective or an ideal, imperialism has turned into an all-encompassing buzzword that many use, though few can really define. Imperialism Past and Present seeks to clarify the prevailing confusion and provide a clear, concise account of imperialism, as well as to introduce readers to the fundamental logic, as well as the complex manifestations of imperialism. It also aims to offer a succinct review and interpretation of the complex experiences that constituted the history of imperialism. The authors contend that imperialism remains at the heart of recent events and ongoing processes that define contemporary politics, and they look at the way that it applies in the post-Cold War period""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

There were plenty of international observers and local and foreign press who were closely tracking the ANC top brass and branch delegates as they jostled for political power and position. The air was thick with anticipation and high with suspicion. Former student activist, member of the then Mitchells Plain Student Congress (Mipsco), COSAS national leader and now ANC member in good standing, Oscar van Heerden once again found himself doing duty in the resolutions drafting team at the ANC's National Conference. What he witnessed in the period leading up to the conference and then the five days of high drama at Nasrec make for an enthralling and insightful insider's view. Van Heerden's observations lay bare a governing party that is at war with itself. At the heart of this struggle is deception, corruption and power-hungry politicians flexing their muscles. Factional infighting, money in bags exchanging hands in the dead of night, spies on duty and a political party in the clutches of state capture are some of the political moves that Van Heerden witnesses and now shares in his book. Van Heerden's assertion after the first two days of the conference is that the Cyril Ramaphosa camp, also known as CR17, did not stand a chance of winning. To him they seemed disorganised, at times not understanding the modalities of election politics at the conference, and had arrived at the gun fight with a knife. How then did the tide turn against the obvious pro-Jacob Zuma camp to favour CR17? What really happened behind closed doors to secure the narrow margin of victory? Walk this journey with Van Heerden and see why, with the upcoming ANC National General Council in June 2020, the fight for our country's leadership is far from over, begging the question: Will Ramaphosa's ANC survive?

For the media to be democratic, they must enter into a positive relationship with their readers, viewers and listeners as citizens rather than consumers who buy things, audiences who gaze upon spectacles or isolated egos, obsessed with themselves. The media's first task is to remind people that they are inhabitants of a world in which they can make a difference. By enabling citizens to encounter and make sense of events, relationships and cultures of which they have no direct experience, the media constitute a public arena in which members of the public come together as more than passing strangers""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The belief that religion was dying became the conventional wisdom in the social sciences during most of the twentieth century. During the last decade, however, the secularization thesis has experienced the most sustained challenge in its long history. The traditional secularization thesis needs updating. Religion has not disappeared and is unlikely to do so. Nevertheless, the concept of secularization captures an important part of what is going on. This book develops a theory of secularization and existential security. Sacred and Secular is essential reading for anyone interested in comparative religion, sociology, public opinion, political behavior, political development, social psychology, international relations, and cultural change.

And as temperatures rise and the ice retreats, Vladimir Putin orders Russia's oil rigs to move north. But one early September morning in 2013 thirty men and women from eighteen countries--the crew of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise--decide to draw a line in the ice and protest the drilling in the Arctic. Thrown together by a common cause, they are determined to stop Putin and the oligarchs. But their protest is met with brutal force as Putin's commandos seize the Arctic Sunrise. Held under armed guard by masked men, they are charged with piracy and face fifteen years in Russia's nightmarish prison system. Ben Stewart--a key member of the campaign to release the Arctic 30--tells an astonishing tale of passion, courage, brutality, and survival. With wit, verve, and candor, he chronicles the extraordinary friendships the activists made with their often murderous cellmates, their battle to outwit the prison guards, and the struggle to stay true to the cause that brought them there""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Crowds and Party extends the energies of the riotous crowds of the last five years into an argument for the political party. Rejecting emphases on individuals and multitudes, Jodi Dean argues that we rethink the collective subject of politics. When crowds appear in spaces unauthorized by capital and the state, such as in the Occupy movement in New York, London and across the world, they create a gap of possibility. But too many on the left remain stuck in this beautiful moment of possibility--they argue for more of the same fragmentation into issues and identities as if this had not been the form of the last thirty years of left defeat. In Crowds and Party, Dean argues that previous discussions of the party have missed its affective dimensions, the way it operates as a knot of unconscious processes, and binds people together. Now, Dean shows how we can see the party as an organization that holds a space for communist political subjectivity and can reinvigorate political practice""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Jerry Mashaw demonstrates that from the very beginning Congress delegated vast discretion to administrative officials and armed them with extrajudicial adjudicatory, rulemaking, and enforcement authority. The legislative and administrative practices of the U.S. Constitution's first century created an administrative constitution hardly hinted at in its formal text. This book, in the author's words, will ""demonstrate that there has been no precipitous fall from a historical position of separation-of-powers grace to a position of compromise; there is not a new administrative constitution whose legitimacy should be understood as not only contestable but deeply problematic.""""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

(Abstract) The influence exerted by Rousseau on the declaration of political rights during the French Revolution is not generally acknowledged. But the role played by him in introducing their counterpart, i.e. a new concept of civil right based on the general principles of equality and liberty, is not known at all. The book follows the latter lead until its final developments in the French civil code of 1804, through the study of some legal institutions of family law and of property and estate law, as well as the Rousseaunian background of jurists like Portalis and others. In the first two chapters the secularisation of marriage and the shaping of a legal model of family are examined. The other three are concerned with the abolition of feudality and the rise of ideas of lawful property, of labour rights, and finally, connected with them, of a new last will and testament law.

The Curse of Demagogues: Lessons Learned from the Presidency of Donald J. Trump,Eli Merritt,political_science,First published in 2022,/works/OL30721597W,/authors/OL10802858A/Eli_Merritt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Merritt, Eli|Language English","The Curse of Demagogues: Lessons Learned from the Presidency of Donald J. Trump is a collection of thirty-two essays by twenty-two writers that makes the case that the pathway back to a healthy American democracy is for citizens, first, to understand demagogues and, second, to defend against them.  As Joseph J. Ellis, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, writes in his essay in the collection:  ""There have been two occasions in American history when the fate of the republic was placed at risk. The first was the Civil War . . . The second was the Great Depression . . . We are currently on the cusp of a third serious challenge to our republican roots, which has emerged in the person of the first full-scale demagogue who was elected president . . . This is the chief reason why the looming election is the most important political event of our lifetime.""  --JOSEPH J. ELLIS, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Founding Brothers and The Cause  Other contributing writers include Jill Abramson, Michael Austin, Frank O. Bowman, III, Curtis A. Bradley, Michael A. Cohen, Barbara Comstock, Jeff Flake, Megan Garber, Bryan Garsten, Jennifer Mercieca, Eli Merritt, Yaël Ossowski, Darryl Paulson, Frederic C. Rich, James Risen, Michael Signer, Andrew Sullivan, Andrew Trees, Jesse Wegman, and Richard Ashby Wilson.  More than any other book in print, The Curse of Demagogues makes the story of Donald Trump's rise to the White House coherent and understandable. Trump, a demagogue, gained ascendancy in a laissez-faire political culture wherein neither the Republican Party nor the other gatekeepers of democracy, including the news media, effectively counteracted him. Once in the highest office in the land, Trump devolved into authoritarianism in order to retain power, as demagogues are well-known to do.  The book has three overarching aims. First, it constitutes a short history of Trump's years in the White House (and his first two campaigns for president) as told from the perspective of scholars, journalists, and legal experts who specifically warned the public about his dangers as a demagogue in real time. Second, the collection is a detailed primer on demagogues and the multifarious ways they poison the vital organs of constitutional democracy. Third, the book is an urgent call to study, debate, research, learn, and, critically, to restore gatekeepers to their essential role as defenders of democracy against demagogues.  To revivify our once great democracy, we must defend it against demagogues by strengthening gatekeeping systems within political parties, the media, and the U.S. Congress (powers of impeachment, conviction, and disqualification from future office) and through vigorous civics, ethics, and media literacy education K-12 and beyond.  As Eli Merritt, editor and contributor, writes in the book's introduction:  ""The enemy of democracy is not a Democrat or Republican. It is a demagogue.""

First published to great acclaim and controversy in 2005 as Steal this Vote, this thoroughly revised edition lifts the lid off the largely undiscussed corruption at the core of our democracy-elections so poorly regulated and administered they fall short of standards the United States routinely imposes on emerging democracies. The problem has only grown worse in the last decade, as campaign spending has gone hog wild, partisan battles rage over voter ID, and a key provision of the Voting Rights Act has been shredded. As award-winning journalist Andrew Gumbel shows, we need proper oversight and regulation of elections, reliable voting machines, and a keener understanding of where private interests infringe on the public good. Now that Citizens United, super PACs, and the Koch brothers have turned the electoral process into an increasingly squalid lottery for billionaires, there is no better time for Gumbel's revision of his acclaimed book""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is a journey that has been anything but easy.In this first full biography of the person seen by many as the honest face of Australian politics, James Norman goes in search of Bob Brown. His is an intimate exploration of Brown's world to reveal the real man his difficult adolescence, the places he loves, his shy struggles around his sexuality, his search for intimacy and his surprising conversion from conservative country doctor to environmental activist and political revolutionary.This is a politician who remains resolutely optimistic yet his philosophy is to be defiant, who is gently spoken yet fires equal amounts of passion in his supporters and opponents alike, who in many respects is very conventional but has pursued a radical local, national and international agenda. This is also a politician who has never lost sight of where it all began, in the fight to save Tasmania's wilderness areas.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The internet once promised to be a place of extraordinary freedom beyond the control of money or politics, but today corporations and platforms exercise more control over our ability to access information and share knowledge to a greater extent than any state. From the online calls to arms in the thick of the Arab Spring to the contemporary front line of misinformation, Jillian C. York charts the war over our digital rights. She looks at both how the big corporations have become unaccountable censors, and the devastating impact it has had on those who have been censored.  In Silicon Values, leading campaigner Jillian C. York looks at how our rights have become increasingly undermined by the major corporations’ desire to harvest our personal data and turn it into profit. She also looks at how governments have used the same technology to monitor citizens and threatened our ability to communicate. As a result our daily lives, and private thoughts, are being policed in an unprecedented manner. Who decides the difference between political debate and hate speech? How does this impact on our identity, our ability to create communities and to protest? Who regulates the censors? In response to this threat to our democracy, York proposes a user-powered movement against the platforms that demands change and a new form of ownership over our own data.

America at war with itself,Henry A. Giroux,political_science,First published in 2017,/works/OL20034865W,/authors/OL19296A/Henry_A._Giroux,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Language English|Pages 319,"""From hatemongering tactics in the run-up to the 2016 presidential race, to the increasing number of mass shootings, to excessive police violence, evidence that America is at war with itself is everywhere around us. The question is not whether or not it's happening, but how to understand what's driving the crisis and how to prevent conditions from getting worse. In this insightful book, Henry A. Giroux offers a far-reaching critique of the economic interests, cultural dynamics, and political forces at work in the nation's shift toward increasingly abusive forms of power, and what can and should be done to resist them. Reflecting on a wide range of social issues, Giroux contrasts Donald Trump's America with Sandra Bland's to understand who really benefits from politically fueled intolerance for immigrants, communities of color, Muslims, low-income families, and those who challenge state and corporate power. A passionate advocate for civil rights and the importance of the imagination, Giroux argues that only through widespread social investment in democracy and education can the common good hope to prevail over the increasingly concentrated influence of extreme right-wing politicians and self-serving economic interests. Praise for America at War with Itself: ""This is the book Americans need to read now. No one is better than Henry Giroux at analyzing the truly dangerous threats to our society. He punctures our delusions and offers us a compelling and enlightened vision of a better way. America at War with Itself is the best book of the year.""-Bob Herbert, Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos and former Op-Ed columnist for the New York Times ""In America at War with Itself, Henry Giroux again proves himself one of North America's most clear-sighted radical philosophers of education, culture and politics: radical because he discards the chaff of liberal critique and cuts to the root of the ills that are withering democracy. Giroux also connects the dots of reckless greed, corporate impunity, poverty, mass incarceration, racism and the co-opting of education to crush critical thinking and promote a culture that denigrates and even criminalizes civil society and the public good. His latest work is the antidote to an alarming tide of toxic authoritarianism that threatens to engulf America. The book could not be more timely.""-Olivia Ward, Toronto Star ""The current U.S. descent into authoritarianism did not just happen. As Henry Giroux brilliantly shows it was the result of public pedagogical work in a number of institutions that were part of a long-standing assault on public goods, the social contract, and democracy itself. Giroux powerfully skewers oppressive forces with the hallmark clarity and rigor that has made him one of the most important cultural critics and public intellectuals in North America. His sharp insights provide readers with the intellectual tools to challenge the tangle of fundamentalisms that characterize the political system, economy, and culture in the current conjuncture. America at War with Itself makes the case for real ideological and structural change at a time when the need and stakes could not be greater. Everyone who cares about the survival and revival of democracy needs to read this book.""-Kenneth Saltman, Professor, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Author of The Failure of Corporate School Reform Henry A. Giroux's most recent books include The Violence of Organized Forgetting and America's Addiction to Terrorism. A prolific writer and political commentator, he has appeared in a wide range of media, including the New York Times and Bill Moyers""--  ""A searing critique of state violence and intolerance in the United States today, Henry Giroux examines how hot-button issues and events reveal the nation's drift toward totalitarian forms of social control. From police violence in black communities to meteoric rise of Donald Trump, Giroux parses the trends and flashpoints to understand the underlying politics and social forces impacting America today""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

Bush and Vice President Cheney deceived Congress and the people to drive us into a war in Iraq; they claimed the right to wiretap illegally and to eavesdrop on citizens; and they authorized torture, unilaterally upending laws and violating international treaty obligations. Yet, both Bush and Cheney are audaciously unapologetic about their crimes. In his recent memoir, President Bush makes no apologies for his decision to start a war in Iraq, though no weapons of mass destruction, the ostensible reason for the war, were found there. Regarding his approval of the waterboarding form of torture, he proudly said, ""Damn right.""   Time and again throughout his term, President Bush proclaimed sternly ""we do not torture."" However, the 2009 release of secret torture documents revealed otherwise. The documents paint a bleak picture of the involvement of President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and top administration officials in unleashing, sanctioning, and conspiring in the infliction of torture. Holtzman and Cooper cite unlawful torture as only one of the many ways that the Bush-Cheney administration transgressed the law, trampled the Constitution, and harmed the image of the United States around the world. Bush and Cheney, the authors argue, authorized and condoned behavior and practices that starkly violate human-rights principles and the rights of American citizens. Congress chose not to pursue impeachment, despite multitudes of citizens advocating for it, Holtzman and Cooper among them. New revelations, however, about the extent and depth of their crimes make the need for accountability imperative.  Holtzman posits that the failure to indict, prosecute, or hold accountable officials at the highest level makes a mockery of U.S. law and sets frightening precedents. With Holtzman's legal expertise and Cooper's bold journalism, Cheating Justice explains why the nation needs to address the Bush-Cheney administration's abuse of power and manipulation of the law._   As a member of Congress and part of the committee that investigated and held hearings on the conduct of President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, Elizabeth Holtzman balks at Bush's echo of Nixon's claim that he was acting in the interest of national security. Using Watergate-era reforms as a model, Holtzman details the steps necessary to undo the damage that the Bush-Cheney administration inflicted and explains how we can establish new protections that will block future presidents from similarly abusing the law. Cheating Justice is a call to empower the American people, and a firm insistence that the nation's leaders are not above the law""--  ""The Bush-Cheney Administration transgressed the law in ways that trampled the Constitution, crushed the concept of lawful conduct and harmed the image of the U.S. around the world. The 2009 release of secret torture documents, in particular, ripped apart the notion that ""'we' do not torture,"" as President Bush liked to say. Torture is against the law, plain and simple. The documents paint a bleak picture of the involvement of President Bush, Vice-President Cheney and top Administration officials in unleashing, sanctioning and conspiring in the infliction of torture. Without indictments, prosecution or accountability, their activities make a mockery of the United States law and especially of the unwavering standard that ""no person is above the law."" The failure to indict, prosecute or hold officials at the highest level accountable sets frightening precedents. Cheating Justice identifies in clear language why the nation needs to address the Bush-Cheney Administration's willing plunge into torture, and, more specifically, how to do it. With Watergate-era reforms as a model, the book will describe the plain steps to undoing the damage that the Bush-Cheney Administration inflicted and to putting into place new protections that will block future presidents from similarly abusing the law. Few topics can be more important for our times: these actions are vital to our freedom and to the nation's future. Following upon their book, The Impeachment of George W. Bush: A Practical Guide for Concerned Citizens, (Nation Books, September 2006) (http://www.channonart.com/impeachBush/index.html) co-authors Elizabeth Holtzman and Cynthia L. Cooper discuss clearly and plainly how and why Bush, Cheney and others can and must be held accountable. ""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Irresistible Revolution: Marxism's Goal of Conquest & the Unmaking of the American Military,Matthew L. Lohmeier,political_science,First published in 2021,/works/OL24488650W,/authors/OL9222403A/Matthew_L._Lohmeier,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL32445578M-M.jpg,"Publish Date May 10, 2021|Publisher  Matthew L. Lohmeier|Language English|Pages 230","Irresistible Revolution is a timely and bold contribution from an active-duty Space Force lieutenant colonel who sees the impact of a neo-Marxist agenda at the ground level within our armed forces. In it, author Matthew Lohmeier provides answers to many important questions that Americans are currently asking: Is systemic racism a reality, or is much of our talk about race merely a rhetorical tool used to divide Americans? Why has the Defense Department suddenly shifted to a focus on extremism within the ranks? Is there really a white supremacy or white nationalist problem within our armed forces? Are the many Diversity and Inclusion trainings that are being conducted in our federal agencies helping solve these problems, or are they creating conflict where none previously existed? What is Marxism, and what does it have to do with all of this?  Though pundits often appear perplexed by current policy decisions being made in our country, our apparent missteps are part of a longstanding plot against America, patiently and methodically pursued by those with a mind intent on the overthrow of the US Government and its replacement with a communist dictatorship. Unfortunately, many of those now furthering that agenda do so unwittingly.  After becoming aware of the Marxist conquest of American society, you will never again look at things in the same way. Mainstream media, social media, the public education system (including universities), as well as federal agencies have all become vessels of various schools of thought that are rooted in Marxist ideology - an ideology bent on the destruction of America's history, of Western tradition, specifically Judeo-Christian values, and of patriotism and conservatism. Marxism's sinister and dark agenda has led the country into what some have called a cold civil war. The problem has become systemic, a tragedy considering that the defeat of Marxist-communist ideology was the very cause against which our nation spent great treasures of blood and iron during much of the twentieth century.  The book's three-part framework begins with a discussion of the greatness of the American ideal (including the importance of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the notions of individual and civil liberties), transitions to an examination of the history and overarching narrative of Marxist ideology (specifically Marx's and Engels' Communist Manifesto wherein the oppressor vs. oppressed narrative is developed), and concludes by looking into the ongoing transformation of America's military culture and military policy, while also providing a warning about where the country is headed if we choose to not make an immediate course correction.  Irresistible Revolution also covers a breadth of hot topics everyone is hearing and talking about - topics that actually have implications for our national security: woke ideology, cancel culture, identity politics, the Black Lives Matter movement, anti-racism, postmodernism, political correctness, and critical and cynical theories, to include critical race theory. Lohmeier's penetrating and common sense look at current events within our military and across American society is a sublimely unique contribution that is certain to be shared, referenced, and discussed for years to come. Every American, including every US military servicemember, needs to read and understand the Irresistible Revolution.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Zur Beurteilung der ökonomischen Konsequenzen solcher vereinigungsbedingter Arbeitsmobilität wird zunächst ein Referenzmodell entwickelt, das später durch Variationen der Annahmen ergänzt bzw. modifiziert wird. Das deutsche Migrationspotential und seine Ausschöpfung werden empirisch geschätzt und die für die Zukunft zu erwartenden Erträge und Kosten aus regionalen Unterschieden monetär bewertet. Verschiedene sich hinsichtlich der Angleichsdauer von Löhnen und Mieten unterscheidende Varianten werden durchgespielt. Die individuellen Kosten-Nutzen-Rechnungen zeigen, dass die möglichen Wanderungserträge von vielen Beschäftigten deutlich unterschätzt wurden.

The book gives an answer to this question with a comparative study of the United States and Germany. Based on expert interviews and in-depth interviews with forty sans papiers, police controls as well as controls in areas such as labor market, health care, housing, schooling and childcare are carefully analysed. The book discusses whether global economic, political or social processes have restricted the ability of advanced capitalist countries to control migration. It argues that migration policy in the OECD countries has become more similar, but this convergence only takes place at the level of policy goals and legal norms. At the level of implementation, national differences persist. The interviews show that sans papiers in the U.S. continue to have many possibilities to participate in society. In contrast, the comprehensive exclusion of sans papiers in Germany confi rms that there is no general “loss of control”.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The predominantly inward-looking, domestic preoccupation of social policy has made way for a more integrated, international and outward approach to analysis which looks beyond the boundaries of the state. It is in this context that this Handbook brings together the work of key commentators in the field of comparative analysis in order to provide comprehensive coverage of contemporary debates and issues in cross-national social policy research. Organized around five themes, this thoroughly revised and updated second edition explores the contextual, conceptual, analytical and processual aspects of undertaking comparative social research. The contributions highlight specific areas of comparative social policy including child poverty and wellbeing, patterns of housing provision and housing inequalities, social protection in East Asia as well as crime and criminology in a global context. The Handbook explores the continuing and emerging themes as well as issues which are of particular relevance to understanding the contemporary social world. International in scope, this authoritative Handbook presents original cutting-edge research from leading specialists, and will become an indispensable source of reference for anyone interested in comparative social research. It will also prove a valuable study aid for undergraduate and postgraduate students from a range of disciplines including social policy, sociology, politics, urban studies and public policy.

Unlike the previous critical studies about La Mothe Le Vayer, the book does not study exclusively the works in which he seemed to undermine the political order, but also takes into account the series of educational treatises that he wrote for the prince between 1640-1658. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, which involves philosophical and literary concepts, the book is likely to deal with a question that could not be more relevant nowadays: should an intellectual who perceives the failings of the political order withdraw into the solitude of his library or get involved in politics in order to try to improve it?""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It was also the year the PAP government recaptured its electoral hyper dominance at Singapore’s 13th General Election held on 11 September 2015. This volume analyses the unexpected results of yet another historic election and considers why a change in voting ensued after the ‘watershed’ polls in 2011. Sixteen well-regarded scholars and political observers uncover the key issues raised and evaluate the impact of the 2015 general election from the perspectives of law, history, politics, media, culture and sociology.
