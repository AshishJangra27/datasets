Driven to protect and take care of her hive, she cleans the nursery and feeds the larvae and the queen. But is she strong enough to fly? Not yet!  Apis builds wax comb to store honey, and transfers pollen from other bees into the storage. She defends the hive from invaders. And finally, she begins her new life as an adventurer.  The confining walls of the hive fall away as Apis takes to the air, finally free, in a brilliant double-gatefold illustration where the clear blue sky is full of promise– and the wings of dozens of honeybees, heading out in search of nectar to bring back to the hive.  Eric Rohmann’s exquisitely detailed illustrations bring the great outdoors into your hands in this poetically written tribute to the hardworking honeybee. Award-winning author Candace Fleming describes the life cycle of the honeybee in accessible, beautiful language. Similar in form and concept to the Sibert and Orbis Pictus award book Giant Squid, Honeybee also features a stunning gatefold and an essay on the plight of honeybees.

Along with this exploration of the historical, contemporary, and future tools—such as the rockets and satellites used to gather data—and galaxies, nebulae, and pulsars found outside of the solar system, are instructions for creating a rubber-band powered Mars rover, using dry ice to simulate the tail of a comet, and models of various phenomena.

Their language, law, literature, customs, technology, and architectural styles have passed into our own everyday lives. As well as the ""invisible"" legacy, the Romans left us many buildings and monuments, some ephemeral ruins, others whole cities, which still survive right across the Empire, from Scotland to Syria. We can still wonder at Roman feats of engineering, art, and architecture, from the soaring aqueducts to the exquisitely worked jewelry. This book looks at many fascinating aspects of everyday life for the Romans two centuries ago, in towns, the countryside, and the army -- the clothes people wore, their jewelry, food, religious beliefs, the entertainment they enjoyed, and how they traveled across their vast Empire, to expand and control it. The text is beautifully illustrated with a wealth of evocative and informative pictures, which bring the exciting past alive and put it into its context. - Jacket flap.

Growing up, Liz Prince wasn’t a girly girl, but she wasn’t exactly one of the guys either (as she learned when her little league baseball coach exiled her to the distant outfield). She was somewhere in between. But with the forces of middle school, high school, parents, friendship, and romance pulling her this way and that, the middle wasn't an easy place to be.  Tomboy follows award-winning author and artist Liz Prince through her early years and explores―with humor, honesty, and poignancy―what it means to ""be a girl."" From staunchly refuting ""girliness"" to the point of misogyny, to discovering through the punk community that your identity is whatever you make of it, Tomboy offers a sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking account of self-discovery in modern America.

Sara Josephine Baker was a strong girl who loved adventure. Growing up in New York in the late 1800s was not easy. When she lost her brother and father to typhoid fever, she became determined to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. In Jo's day, medical schools were closed to women, but times were changing, and Jo was at the forefront. When she graduated in 1898, Dr. Jo still faced prejudice against women in her field. Not many people were willing to be seen by a female doctor, and Dr. Jo's waiting room remained mostly empty. She accepted a job in public health and was sent to Hell's Kitchen, one of New York's poorest neighborhoods where many immigrants lived. There, she was able to treat the most vulnerable patients: babies and children. She realized that the best treatment was to help babies get a stronger start in life. Babies need fresh air, clean and safe environments, and proper food. Dr. Jo's successes, fueled by her determination, compassion and ingenuity, made her famous across the nation for saving the lives of 90,000 inner city infants and children.

In town she's the rich one--the great-great-granddaughter of the mill's founder. At school she's hot Maddie Ward's younger sister. And at home, she's the good one, her stoner older brother Joey's babysitter. Everything was turned on its head, though, when she and Joey were in the car accident that killed Candy MontClaire. The car accident that revealed just how bad Joey's drug habit was.  Four months later, Emmy's junior year is starting, Joey is home from rehab, and the entire town of Mill Haven is still reeling from the accident. Everyone's telling Emmy who she is, but so much has changed, how can she be the same person? Or was she ever that person at all?  Mill Haven wants everyone to live one story, but Emmy's beginning to see that people are more than they appear. Her brother, who might not be ""cured,"" the popular guy who lives next door, and most of all, many ""ghostie"" addicts who haunt the edges of the town. People spend so much time telling her who she is--it might be time to decide for herself.  A journey of one sister, one brother, one family, to finally recognize and love each other for who they are, not who they are supposed to be, You'd Be Home Now is Kathleen Glasgow's glorious and heartbreaking story about the opioid crisis, and how it touches all of us.

Tales and Sketches (Mosses from an Old Manse / Snow-Image and other twice-told tales / Tanglewood Tales for Girls and Boys / Twice-Told Tales / Wonder Book for Girls and Boys),Nathaniel Hawthorne,juvenile_literature,First published in 1982,/works/OL15299316W?edition=ia%3Atalessketches00hawt,/authors/OL26681A/Nathaniel_Hawthorne,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL3780701M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1982|Publisher  Library of America|Language English|Pages 1493,"This volume offers what no reader has ever been able to find—an authoritative edition of all the tales and sketches of Nathaniel Hawthorne in a single comprehensive volume. Everything is included from his three books of stories, Twice-told Tales (1837, revised 1851), Mosses from an Old Manse (1846, 1854), The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-told Tales (1851) and from his two books of stories for children based on classical myths, A Wonder Book for Girls and Boys (1852) and Tanglewood Tales (1853)—along with sixteen stories not found in any of these volumes.  The stories are arranged, as they never have been in any other edition, in the order of their periodical publication. Readers of Hawthorne will thereby get a unique sense of how he became one of the most powerful and experimental writers of American fiction.  Here are many familiar but always surprising works like “Young Goodman Brown,” “Wakefield,” “The Birth-mark,” “The Artist of the Beautiful,” “Rappaccini’s Daughter,” and “Ethan Brand.” And here, too, are many others that deserve to be better known, like:  “Roger Malvin’s Burial,” a suspenseful story of guilt and parricide;    “The May-Pole of Merry Mount,” where the chances for human love are perilously suspended between the silken license of the revelers and the iron rectitude of the Puritans;    the masterly tale “My Kinsman, Major Molineux,” full of the pains and terrors of national and familial separations, the severing of the ties of blood and culture that united the colonies to England;    and the exquisite little story “The Wives of the Dead,” about the ambiguities of love and loss, in which, as so often in Hawthorne, the reader at the end is left in a kind of awe at the multiple possibilities of meaning.    To read these stories is to understand anew why Hawthorne is a great artist and an astonishingly contemporary one.    --jacket   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Young girls today need strong female role models to embrace the idea that it's okay to be smart—in fact, it's sexy to be smart!It's Danica McKellar's mission to be this role model, and demonstrate on a large scale that math doesn't suck. In this fun and accessible guide, McKellar—dubbed a ""math superstar"" by The New York Times—gives girls and their parents the tools they need to master the math concepts that confuse middle-schoolers most, including fractions, percentages, pre-algebra, and more. The book features hip, real-world examples, step-by-step instruction, and engaging stories of Danica's own childhood struggles in math (and stardom). In addition, borrowing from the style of today's teen magazines, it even includes a Math Horoscope section, Math Personality Quizzes, and Real-Life Testimonials—ultimately revealing why math is easier and cooler than readers think.""McKellar is probably the only person on prime-time television who moonlights as a cyberspace math tutor.""—The New York Times""[When] girls tell [Danica] that they're studying math because of her, she says, ‘I feel I'm helping them find a talent they didn't know they had.'""—People   Read more Read less",9 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In this graphic masterpiece, John Porcellino uses only the words of Henry David Thoreau to tell the story of the two years he spent on Walden Pond. The pared-down text focuses on Thoreau's most profound ideas, and Porcellino's fresh, simple pictures capture the essence of the philosopher's writings.  For readears who know Walden intimately, this graphic treatment will provide a new interpretation of Thoreau's story. For those who have never read the original, Thoreau at Walden presents a contemporary look at his call to slow down in a ever-accelerating world.

Co.|Language English,"Many people find centipedes creepy because of their many sets of legs, but these little creatures can also inflict some serious pain. Centipedes have poisonous claws that they use to capture prey and fight off enemies. The claws can be quite painful for a human, but rarely deadly. These are just some of the startling facts children will discover as they explore the strange and unusual world of these creepy crawlers. Vivid, eye-popping photos and clear, grade-appropriate text will engage emergent and early readers as they learn about the natural habitat, physical characteristics, diet, and behavior of this unique invertebrate.

Most of us only notice large insects and those that bite or sting. The rest we ignore as small, black creepy-crawlies. In fact, the insect world is full of surprises.  Like all animals, each insect does a job. Without them our world would be very different.  A tiny world  Insects live in a strange world. A slight breeze can blow them away. Grass blades become tree trunks. Pebbles are like mountains. Even raindrops turn into deadly pools.  On a summer day the ground can be very hot. Even so, every morning a thin layer of ice covers the same ground. We do not see or feel these things. We stand well above the world of the insect. Our warm bodies protect us from the cold. The body of an insect does not stay warm like ours. It cools down during the cold night.  Shapes for life  Insects cope with their world in many ways. Millions of years of living has shaped each type of insect. Some are long and thin and live in tunnels. Others are shaped for flying.  No two types live in exactly the same place. Some insects survive where no other animals can. Young midges live in hot springs. They can stand temperatures that would fry other animals. One kind of fly even breeds in pools of oil.    ▼ You can find insects almost anywhere on Earth. Young midges live at temperatures up to 40°C in these hot springs of Yellowstone Park, Wyoming, USA.

To get that petroleum, oil and gas companies search all over the planet--from northernmost Canada to deep under the ocean. Because it is such a valuable commodity, petroleum has become known as black gold. And because of global dependence on this natural resource, scholars say we are living in the Age of Oil.   Alongside its benefits, petroleum has serious drawbacks. It is not a renewable resource, and many of Earth's most easily accessed petroleum deposits have been used up. Companies have begun to search for oil in more difficult-to-reach places, using controversial methods. Extracting, processing, and refining oil is often environmentally destructive. Oil spills and other accidents can contaminate soil and water, kill wildlife, and make people sick. On a larger scale, burning fossil fuels such as petroleum releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, leading to climate change.   Even as governments, activists, and researchers explore a wide range of conservation measures and alternative fuel sources, the world continues to run on petroleum. And the struggle to balance the pros and cons of this coveted resource will play a decisive role in the planet's future.

He began learning the skills he would need to fly as a member of the Civil Air Patrol, a branch of the U.S. Air Force, when he was just twelve years old. But it wasn't until he graduated from the naval ROTC program at the University of Nebraska and joined the navy that his dream became a reality. For five years, Osborn practiced rigorous training exercises, working tirelessly day in and day out until he advanced from navy pilot to mission commander.All Lt. Osborn's flying skills were put to the test when a Chinese F-8 II fighter jet collided with his EP-3E ARIES II plane during a U.S. surveillance mission through international airspace. The impact severely damaged Osborn's aircraft, sending it plummeting toward the ocean. With almost certain disaster looming, Osborn managed to gain control of the crippled plane and land it safely on the Chinese island of Hainan--saving the lives of his twenty-three crewmates.In Born to Fly, Shane Osborn describes these terrifying events in vivid detail, along with the years of dedicated training that made the emergency landing possible. This is the inspirational story of a boy with a dream, and of the extraordinary discipline and courage that made him a hero.From the Hardcover edition.

If that man is Genghis Khan, the answer is yes. Born around 1161, Temujin, as he was named, grew up in humble surroundings. As a teenager, he fled from enemy raiders, but he became a fearless—and feared—man who commanded an army of thousands and an empire of millions. In fact, by the mid-1200s Genghis Khan’s Mongol Empire included much of the known world. Though he was responsible for the deaths of millions, he also showed tolerance for religious and cultural differences among the many peoples he conquered, and he brought stability and unification to a vast area where it had never before existed. Even today, the name Genghis Khan continues to instill fear in some and admiration in others. His election as Great Khan in approximately 1190 is surely one of history’s most pivotal moments.

This brilliant, witty, and often outrageous satirist's talent and stature among American authors are only now becoming fully appreciated; his sometimes bitter cynicism and uncompromising individualism seem even more appropriate to our time than to his own.  The stories, written between 1882 and 1896, when the mature Bierce was at the peak of his narrative powers, fall into three groups:  Tales of the macabre and the supernatural, which use the element of horror to make the satiric point.  Grimly realistic stories of war, emphasizing its brutality and human waste; ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" and ""Chickamagua"" are two well-known works in this vein.  Wildly exaggerated ""tall tales"" of the type told and retold in the old West, delivering a sharp satiric barb with their free-swinging comedy.  To complete this treasury of Bierce's work, Professor Ernest J. Hopkins has written forewords for each group of stories and an illuminating critical and biographical introduction which shows the remarkable originality, insight, and enduring pertinence of Ambrose Bierce.    --jacket flap   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

In this exciting book, you can learn what makes luna moths similar to and different from other insects. Close-up photographs and diagrams reveal extraordinary details about moths’ bodies, both inside and out.

A church father was arrested and martyred for teaching the truth about Christ's incarnation. Captured by pirates and shipped off to Ireland, a priest baptized thousands of pagans, from paupers to princes. Now who ever said church history was boring? The Church History ABCs is a fun way for kids to learn about great figures in Christian history. Twenty-six heroes of the faith march through the alphabet, boldly telling their stories in language children can understand. This wide range of characters -- men and women from across the centuries, from all over the globe -- reflects the breadth of church history and reminds children that these great figures of the past were living, breathing people who lived and died for the glory of God. - Publisher.

Influenced heavily by Islam in their later periods, these empires flourished and grew under a series of powerful leaders, including one, Mansa Musa, whose skills were celebrated in European capitals. ""Empires of Medieval West Africa, Revised Edition"" discusses the vital role salt and other natural resources played in the development of the empires, the rich and diverse cultures, and the influence of the growing Islamic Empire on every day life. Included are some transcriptions of the oral tradition that is, in many cases, the only record of the deeds and achievements of these people. Connections to life today include the continuing impact of Islam and tribal groups in today's Africa and the influence of the medieval traditions on modern music and cuisine.
