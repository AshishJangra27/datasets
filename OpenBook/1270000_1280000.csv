There are three  constituent parts to the Course: The Text, a Workbook for Students, and the  Manual for Teachers. The Text lays out the theoretical foundation for the  metaphysical system of the Course. The Workbook contains a series of 365  Lessons to be practiced daily for the purpose of retraining the mind and  healing our perception. Finally, the Manual contains information for and about  advanced teachers of God. A Course in Miracles is also about miracles, which  students understand to be, in part, a shift in perception to healed vision.  But miracles are more than a shift in perception, because the shift has  consequences in the world as we see it. The conversational tone of this  Original Edition invites the novice student into conversation with the Author,  and even advanced students of A Course in Miracles have found a new clarity  and a deeper understanding from their study of the Original Edition of the  Course. The restoration of the previously lost material and presentation of  the text in its original sequence enlivens the conversation with the Author  and gives him a presence that some feel is lacking in the later editions. When  encountering Schucman and ThetfordA¢a‚¬a„¢s original edition, students  frequently find fresh clarity as they read its wording or new understanding.  Surely study of the Original Edition is essential to your curriculum.

Americanism,David Hillel Gelernter,religion,First published in 2007,/works/OL2655842W?edition=ia%3Aamericanismfourt00gele,/authors/OL387266A/David_Hillel_Gelernter,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL17871356M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2007|Publisher  Doubleday|Language English,"What does it mean to ""believe"" in America? Why do we always speak of our country as having a mission or purpose that is higher than other nations?Modern liberals have invested a great deal in the notion that America was founded as a secular state, with religion relegated to the private sphere. David Gelernter argues that America is not secular at all, but a powerful religious idea--indeed, a religion in its own right.Gelernter argues that what we have come to call ""Americanism"" is in fact a secular version of Zionism. Not the Zionism of the ancient Hebrews, but that of the Puritan founders who saw themselves as the new children of Israel, creating a new Jerusalem in a new world. Their faith-based ideals of liberty, equality, and democratic governance had a greater influence on the nation's founders than the Enlightenment.Gelernter traces the development of the American religion from its roots in the Puritan Zionism of seventeenth-century New England to the idealistic fighting faith it has become, a militant creed dedicated to spreading freedom around the world. The central figures in this process were Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, who presided over the secularization of the American Zionist idea into the form we now know as Americanism.If America is a religion, it is a religion without a god, and it is a global religion. People who believe in America live all over the world. Its adherents have included oppressed and freedom-loving peoples everywhere--from the patriots of the Greek and Hungarian revolutions to the martyred Chinese dissidents of Tiananmen Square.Gelernter also shows that anti-Americanism, particularly the virulent kind that is found today in Europe, is a reaction against this religious conception of America on the part of those who adhere to a rival religion of pacifism and appeasement.A startlingly original argument about the religious meaning of America and why it is loved--and hated--with so much passion at home and abroad.

Through centuries of crises and opportunities, many have taken up this theme to inspire the nation. But others have criticized the notion because it implies a sense of superiority which can fuel racism, warmongering and even idolatry. In this remarkable book, John Wilsey traces the historical development of exceptionalism, including its theological meaning and implications for civil religion. From seventeenth-century Puritans to twentieth-century industrialists, from politicians to educators, exceptionalism does not appear as a monolithic concept to be either totally rejected or devotedly embraced. While it can lead to abuses, it can also point to constructive civil engagement and human flourishing. This book considers historically and theologically what makes the difference. Neither the term nor the idea of American exceptionalism is going away. John Wilsey's careful history and analysis will therefore prove an important touchstone for discussions of American identity in the decades to come.

Untangling the Middle East is a layman's guide to the history -- political, religious, and cultural -- that led us to the current challenges plaguing the Middle East. It covers the major interests and actors in the region, from Israel to ISIS, and helps to spin a narrative of the evolution of violence and conflict in this age-old hotbed of unrest. There are no easy answers or simple explanations to be found here, only a clear-eyed and engaging recounting of the many factors that have brought this region to where it is today. Whether he is discussing the history of the Semitic peoples or the birth of Islam in the region, Soltes brings insight and much needed context to the people, places, and things that make up the inheritance of today's Middle East. He possesses the historian's appreciation for detail and the teacher's knack for fashioning coherence out of complex material. This book should be a go-to resource for a solid foundation in understanding the Middle East and a bulwark against the disinformation regarding this region that is often found on cable television or in speeches on the campaign trail. The Middle East may be a mess but it need not be a mystery, with the help of this indispensable guide.""--ONIX annotation.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It deals with the theology, public policy, psychological and social theory, and social policy implementation of forgiveness.The first section of the book explores how ideas like “forgiveness” and “reconciliation” are moving out from the seminary and academy into the world of public policy, and how these terms have been used and defined in the past. One of the contributors, Miroslav Volf, speaks to the Christian contribution of a more peaceful environment. The second section looks at forgiveness and public policy. One of the chapters, by Donald W. Shriver, Jr., addresses forgiveness in a secular political forum.The third section of the book draws us to a more particular analysis of the relationship between forgiveness and reconciliation from voices in the academic and theological community. John Paul Lederach presents five qualities of practice in support of the reconciliation process. John Dawson gives hope for peace-making in a new century. The final section highlights the work of practitioners currently working with religion, public policy, and conflict transformation, particularly in areas such as Ireland and Africa. This book will be an essential resource for libraries, scholars, conflict negotiators, and all people who hope to understand the role of forgiveness in the peace process.Contributors include: Desmond M.

To many, spirit possession is quintessentially exotic, a novelty, an example of the ways in which ""others"" are fundamentally different. In this book, Seligman shows that, far from being exotic and ""other,"" spirit possession mediumship represents a privileged site for understanding a number of fundamental aspects of human experience - especially those involved with interactions among meaning, embodiment, and subjectivity. Using a diverse set of ethnographic, psychological, and biological data gathered during fieldwork among spirit possession mediums of the Candomble; religion in Northeastern Brazil, she explores how everyday and religious practices and meanings shape and interact with the bodily experiences and psychophysiological states of Candomble; mediums, both before and after their initiations, and how such interactions shape their experiences of selfhood""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His proper name is thus an open-ended, all-encompassing list, a mystery the Church embraces in its rhetoric, but which many Christians have found difficult to accept. To explore this conflict, Valentina Izmirlieva examines two lists of God’s names: one from The Divine Names, the classic treatise by Pseudo-Dionysius, and the other from The 72 Names of the Lord, an amulet whose history binds together Kabbalah and Christianity, Jews and Slavs, Palestine, Provence, and the Balkans.This unexpected juxtaposition of a theological treatise and a magical amulet allows Izmirlieva to reveal lists’ rhetorical potential to create order and to function as both tools of knowledge and of power. Despite the two different visions of order represented by each list, Izmirlieva finds that their uses in Christian practice point to a complementary relationship between the existential need for God’s protection and the metaphysical desire to submit to his infinite majesty—a compelling claim sure to provoke discussion among scholars in many fields.

Radical otherness,Lisa Isherwood,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL20956298W,/authors/OL26215A/Lisa_Isherwood,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Acumen|Language English|Pages 185,"The problem of otherness is central to debates in both the social sciences and theology. To define the other--by colour, gender, politics, nationality, or religion--is to define the self. Othering has been used through history as a justification for boundary-setting, for conflict and for oppression. Radical Otherness presents a broad overview of otherness in both sociology and theology. The book reveals how social theory can illuminate many contemporary issues in theology, whilst the examination of theological methods can shed light on problematic issues in sociology. The discussion of issues in Radical Otherness moves from the personal to the political, to the hermeneutic, to the ultimate otherness of metaphysics. At each stage, discussion of theory is grounded in concrete examples. The book offers students of ethics, theology, and sociology of religion a clear and engaged assessment of otherness, and opens up new ways for investigating a concept central to the study of both religion and society.

More recently, however, a growing body of scholarship is revealing the degree to which identities in the late Roman world were fluid, blurred by ethnic, social, and gender differences. Christianness, for example, was only one of a plurality of identities available to Christians in this period. In Christians and Their Many Identities in Late Antiquity, North Africa, 200-450 CE, Éric Rebillard explores how Christians in North Africa between the age of Tertullian and the age of Augustine were selective in identifying as Christian, giving salience to their religious identity only intermittently. By shifting the focus from groups to individuals, Rebillard more broadly questions the existence of bounded, stable, and homogeneous groups based on Christianness. In emphasizing that the intermittency of Christianness is structurally consistent in the everyday life of Christians from the end of the second to the middle of the fifth century, this book opens a whole range of new questions for the understanding of a crucial period in the history of Christianity""--Publisher's Web site.

The spirit and the letter,Paul S. Fiddes,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL20957058W,/authors/OL8019376A/Paul_S._Fiddes,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Bloomsbury T & T Clark|Language English|Pages 266,"Paul's statement that 'letter kills but the spirit gives life' [2 Corinthians 3.6] has had an extraordinary impact on Christian thought through the ages. It has been read both as affirming the saving power of the new covenant in comparison to the old, and as a key to hidden, spiritual meanings in the text of scripture. It is, however, an ambiguous phrase, followed by a tangled story. This book explores the Pauline distinction both in its original context and in its aftermath in the early church, the Reformation and modern Biblical Studies. It then considers a postmodern reversal, where ideas of 'Spirit' are often seen as 'deadly' and the openness of the 'letter' or text as life-affirming, and it draws conclusions for spirit in the world.

Leave your loneliness behind.  We all want to matter to someone, but the risks of relationship can seem far too great. It's easier to just keep our distance. We fear embarrassment, misunderstandings, and even rejection, so we silently endure our loneliness. We work on trying to be nice--rather than being real--hoping that others will like us. Or we might simply give in to the path of least resistance--the life of hurry, impatience, and fatigue--which feels familiar and safe. We pay a terrible price to avoid authentic relationships. It's time to stop denying your deepest longing--the desire to be known and loved. The Naked Soul shows you how to know and accept others, and how to be known and accepted by others. You can exchange the familiar but deadly territory of loneliness for the exhilaration of giving and receiving love. You don't have to hide any longer. Break free from loneliness, be the person God created you to be, and start living a life that matters.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Are there realities that we can experience but not easily measure? Does your consciousness depend entirely on your brain, or does it extend beyond? In Fingerprints of God, award-winning journalist Barbara Bradley Hagerty delves into the discoveries science is making about how faith and spirituality affect us physically and emotionally as it attempts to understand whether the ineffable place beyond this world can be rationally even scientificallyexplained.Hagerty interviews some of the worlds top scientists to describe what their groundbreaking research reveals about our human spiritual experience. From analyses of the brain functions of Buddhist monks and Carmelite nuns, to the possibilities of healing the sick through directed prayer, to what near-death experiences illuminate about the afterlife, Hagerty reaches beyond what we think we know to understand what happens to us when we believe in a higher power.Paralleling the discoveries of science is Hagertys own account of her spiritual evolution. Raised a Christian Scientist, she was a scrupulous adherent until a small moment as an adult triggered a revaluation of her beliefs, which in turn led her to a new way of thinking about God and faith.An insightful examination of what science is learning about how and why we believe, Fingerprints of God is also a moving story of one persons search for a communion with a higher power and what she discovered on that journey.

Garry Wills argues that Jesus subscribed to no political program. He was far more radical than that. In a fresh reading of the gospels, Wills explores the meaning of the ""reign of heaven"" Jesus not only promised for the future but brought with him into this life. It is only by dodges and evasions that people misrepresent what Jesus plainly had to say against power, the wealthy, and religion itself. Jesus came from the lower class, the working class, and he spoke to and for that class. This is a book that will challenge the assumptions of almost everyone who brings religion into politics—""Christian socialists"" as well as biblical theocrats.But Wills is just as critical of those who would make Jesus a mere ethical teacher, ignoring or playing down his divinity. Jesus without the Resurrection is simply not the Jesus of the gospels. Wills calls his book a profession of faith in the risen Lord, the Son of the Father, who leads us to the Father. He argues that this does not make people embrace an otherworldliness that ignores the poor or the problems of our time.What Jesus Meant will no doubt spark debate about our understanding of Jesus and the Scriptures, especially as we head into midterm elections that will certainly prompt many heated discussions on the role of religion in our society.

His first book, The Joy of Living, was a New York Times bestseller hailed as ""compelling, readable, and informed"" (Buddhadharma) and praised by Richard Gere, Lou Reed, and Julian Schnabel for its clarity, wit, and unique insight into the relationship between science and Buddhism.His new book, Joyful Wisdom, addresses the timely and timeless problem of anxiety in our everyday lives. ""From the 2,500-year-old perspective of Buddhism,"" Yongey Mingyur writes, ""every chapter in human history could be described as an 'age of anxiety.' The anxiety we feel now has been part of the human condition for centuries."" So what do we do? Escape or succumb? Both routes inevitably lead to more complications and problems in our lives. ""Buddhism,"" he says, ""offers a third option. We can look directly at the disturbing emotions and other problems we experience in our lives as stepping-stones to freedom. Instead of rejecting them or surrendering to them, we can befriend them, working through them to reach an enduring authentic experience of our inherent wisdom, confidence, clarity, and joy.""Divided into three parts like a traditional Buddhist text, Joyful Wisdom identifies the sources of our unease, describes methods of meditation that enable us to transform our experience into deeper insight, and applies these methods to common emotional, physical, and personal problems. The result is a work at once wise, anecdotal, funny, informed, and graced with the author's irresistible charm.From the Hardcover edition.

El zen no propone ni dios ni revelacion, ni dogma, ni promete ningun paraiso. Pone el acento en la dimension existencial invitando a cada un o a desdramatizar sus sufrimientos y a liberarse de ellos. Su exito no puede explicarse por una seduccion facil, pues su practica es rigurosa y sus maestros tienen reputacion de severos. El zen es una practica abierta a todos, en la que la experiencia del despertar esta al alcance de todos sin distincion de ninguna clase.

Following the phenomenal success of his own version of the Tao Te Ching, renowned scholar and translator Stephen Mitchell has composed the innovative The Second Book of the Tao. Drawn from the work of Lao-tzu's disciple Chuang-tzu and Confucius's grandson Tzussu, The Second Book of the Tao offers Western readers a path into reality that has nothing to do with Taoism or Buddhism or old or new alone, but everything to do with truth. Mitchell has selected the freshest, clearest teachings from these two great students of the Tao and adapted them into versions that reveal the poetry, depth, and humor of the original texts with a thrilling new power. Alongside each adaptation, Mitchell includes his own commentary, at once explicating and complementing the text.This book is a twenty-first-century form of ancient wisdom, bringing a new, homemade sequel to the Tao Te Ching into the modern world. Mitchell's renditions are radiantly lucid; they dig out the vision that's hiding beneath the words; they grab the text by the scruff of the neck-by its heart, really-and let its essential meanings fall out. The book introduces us to a cast of vivid characters, most of them humble artisans or servants, who show us what it means to be in harmony with the way things are. Its wisdom provides a psychological and moral acuity as deep as the Tao Te Ching itself.The Second Book of the Tao is a gift to contemporary readers, granting us access to our own fundamental wisdom. Mitchell's meditations and risky reimagining of the original texts are brilliant and liberating, not least because they keep catching us off-guard, opening up the heavens where before we saw a roof. He makes the ancient teachings at once modern, relevant, and timeless.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It inspires with wonderful images of early Christian art and feeds meditation through the words and wisdom of great Christian souls from the earliest times. These powerful words and pictures combine to make it a unique quote book.  These pages can be experienced in a way that helps us renew within ourselves the spirit which has illumined the efforts of Christian seekers for many centuries.Christian Spirit was named the best Religion and Philosophy book of 2004 by the Midwest Publisher's Association.Containing a wide variety of early Christian art from sources as varied as the Coptic and Celtic traditions and wide-ranging quotations from Christian saints and sages of the first one and a half millennia of Christianity, this book invites the reader to reflect upon the beauty and wisdom of the Christian spirit. The visual and written treasures contained in this volume formed the sacred foundation of the early Church and established a tradition which may even now be traced back to the Gospels. Though specifically Christian in content, the book in hand should provide a source of spiritual inspiration to seekers of all faiths.What is the essential message of the great saints and sages in the first one and a half millennia of Christianity? Is there a unifying doctrine within the different branches of the Christian Church? Are there common spiritual Truths that exist within each of the world’s great religions? The gem-like selections of art and writings in Christian Spirit cover the first one and a half millennia of Christianity, beginning shortly after the death of the Christ. All spiritual seekers, regardless of specific religious affiliation, will the inspired by the beauty and wisdom contained in this book.

O'donoghue is a lucid but very congenial writer. He doesn't get lost in theological jargon, but he is extraordinarily erudite and always interesting. His interest is in the mystical qualities of Celtic writing and the powerful connection with nature and creation. Unlike many dry scholarly writers, O'Donoghue includes enchanting passages of natural landscape and his own youth in the west of Ireland where the ancient spritual practices still held power over the everyday lives of the Irish. The book is a restrained but obvious challenge to the hegemony of the Roman church in catholic spirituality. It is also a hearfelt plea for appreciation of the great contributions of the Celtic church in its vital response to christianity and its native and ingenuous and inspired use of the irish culture to praise the Lord of Creation and the life of Christ. O'Donoghue was an inspired teacher and a fearless writer. He is a valuable voice for Irish Catholics wishing to know more about the legacy of faith, and he is a writer who should be read widely and celebrated for his fresh and engaging views of chuarch history.

However, having long struggled to understand the purpose of life and the meaning of suffering, Michael Novak finds the reality of spiritual life far different from the rhetorical war presented by bestselling atheists and the defenders of the faith who oppose them.In No One Sees God, Novak brilliantly recasts the tired debate pitting faith against reason. Both the atheist and the believer experience the same ""dark night"" in which God's presence seems absent, he argues, and the conflict between faith and doubt stems not from objective differences, but from divergent attitudes toward the unknown. Drawing from his lifelong passion for philosophy and his personal struggles with belief, he shows that, far from being irrational, the spiritual perspective actually provides the most satisfying answers to the eternal questions of meaning. Faith is a challenge at times, but it nonetheless offers the only fully coherent response to the human experience.Ultimately, No One Sees God offers believers and unbelievers the opportunity to find common ground by acknowledging the complicated reality of the human struggle with doubt. Novak provides a stirring defense of the Christian worldview, while sidestepping the shrill tone that so often characterizes the discussion of faith, and given the challenges faced in the present age, all who value liberty will find hope in his new way of conversing.

It often comes suddenly, without warning, and without mercy. Survivors miss the familiar voice, the personal touch, and the intimate companionship of deceased loved ones. Amid grief and pain, many wonder, Is it possible to talk to the dead? Surprisingly, millions are answering, Yes. Unquestionably!Perhaps you havent noticed the ghostly trend, but dialog with the deceased is fast becoming a national obsession. Best-selling authors are writing about it, TV talk shows are discussing it, and research scientists are studying it. For those who have done their homework, it has become crystal clear that a supernatural world does indeed exist, and invisible entities are speaking from the other side.Yet hidden danger lurks beyond the veil. Unknown to most, spirits can lie, and ghosts can deceive. The last book of the Bible sounds this sober warning, For they are spirits of demons, performing signs... (Revelation 16:14).With penetrating insight, Demons in Disguise explains this apocalyptic phenomenon and provides solid biblical answers to the perplexing questions of life, death, and the afterlife.

Today, one in five people throughout the world calls for daily praises and blessings upon him and holds him up as a model of virtue. In IMAGES OF MUHAMMAD, Tarif Khalidi examines the ways Muhammad has been depicted and revered from the immediate aftermath of his death to the present day. With scholarly authority, Khalidi explores how the ""biography"" of Muhammad has been constructed, reconstructed, and utilized in various Islamic cultures, and traces the influences that have shaped his image, including the profound effect of negative perceptions promulgated by the West. As he describes the great variety of Islamic beliefs and practices, Khalidi illuminates the values and ideas shared by the Sunni, Shia, and Sufi sects, as well as the differences among them, providing Western readers with a clear, objective perspective on the current conflicts within the Muslim world as well as their global repercussions.From the Hardcover edition.

Sarah Jones was only eight years old in the summer of 1964, but with her mother Esther Mae on eight prayer lists and flipping around town with the generally mistrusted civil rights organizers, Sarah believed it was time to get baptized and take responsibility for her own sins. That would mean sitting on the mourners bench come revival, waiting for her sign, and then testifying in front of the whole church. But first, Sarah would need to navigate the growing tensions of small-town Arkansas in the 1960s. Both smarter and more serious than her years (a ""fifty-year-old mind in an eight-year-old body,"" according to Esther), Sarah was torn between the traditions, religion, and work ethic of her community and the progressive civil rights and feminist politics of her mother, who had recently returned from art school in Chicago. When organizers from the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) came to town just as the revival was beginning, Sarah couldn't help but be caught up in the turmoil. Most folks just wanted to keep the peace, and Reverend Jefferson called the SNCC organizers ""the evil among us."" But her mother, along with local civil rights activist Carrie Dilworth, the SNCC organizers, Daisy Bates, attorney John Walker, and indeed most of the country, seemed determined to push Maeby toward integration.

Yet for many people, prayer has been reduced to a rote practice that has lost its basic meaning and efficacy.In his long-awaited first book for an ecumenical readership, internationally renowned spiritual healer Ron Roth teaches his unique approach to prayer as energy medicine. The Healing Path of Prayer explains in detail the connection between healing, faith, and prayer. Roth shows you how to find your own path to prayer in a way that connects with God's healing energy. As Roth explains, you can use this energy not only for physical healing but also, perhaps more significantly, for healing emotional and spiritual wounds that may be at the root of physical maladies.The Healing Path of Prayer gives you specific guidance in setting up a daily healing prayer practice. Through a series of simple but effective exercises and rituals, Roth shows you how to celebrate your own sacraments and become a mystic in the course of your everyday life. Each chapter offers a new, higher level of prayer, enabling you to acquire more advanced techniques of focus, intention, and insight. As Roth revitalizes many tired, traditional prayers with his fresh and inspiring reinterpretations from original scripture, he also recounts the dramatic story of when he discovered his healing abilities, as well as true cases of healing in which he has participated. The Healing Path of Prayer is a blueprint for a truly democratic spirituality. Roth's instruction on how to pray and establish a daily practice of meditation will lead readers into a vital path of everyday mysticism and personal power.From the Hardcover edition.

Though this grid can be a helpful tool, far too often it is a weight around the neck. So what can be done about it? How can readers change their perspectives--replacing the grid that drags them down with one that equips them to face life's challenges and live victoriously? In Look at It This Way, author and speaker Jan Silvious explores, in-depth, vital truths that can help Christians reframe the way they think: breaking them out of their self-pity, anger, depression, anxiety and hopelessness, and equipping them to deal with the events, circumstances and people in their lives in a healthy and positive way. Jan highlights such key truths as ""Whatever happens, it's one event in a lifetime of events,"" ""For every choice there is a consequence,"" ""God isn't angry with you,"" ""The last chapter has not been written,"" and eight others. Deeply rooted in Scripture, these valuable insights will give readers hope and real help for managing their thinking, showing how they can, at last, move forward with the courageous and grace-filled life God intended them to live.From the Hardcover edition.

In this intelligent yet humorous and highly accessible guide, religious studies professor Kristin Swenson answers the above questions and more as she provides readers with basic biblical literacy. Swenson incorporates contemporary pop references—from Wall-E to Battlestar Galactica to rock music and more—with the latest findings of biblical scholarship to offer contextual understanding of the Bible's often complex, ambiguous, and seemingly contradictory texts. Her engaging and illuminating book does not aim to convert readers nor undermine their beliefs, but to offer basic knowledge needed to comprehend arguments and answer vexing questions about the Bible, appreciate artistic and literary references, and interpret the most talked about book of all time for themselves.

This book explores historical foundations and contemporary dynamics of religious intermarriage in the U.S. as a lens to the transformation of religion in America. In the lives of these families, categories like Christian, non-Christian, religious or non-religious no longer apply.

Huguenin|Language English,"The walls were meant to keep evil out-but they only hid the evil within.  John has given up his ordinary life to find wisdom traveling the country and enjoy the freedom of living as a nomad. But when he stumbles across a mysterious town tucked away in the Appalachian Mountains, walled off from modern society, he discovers a group of people who could use some freedom of their own. Are they a harmless religious sect, or is there something less benign underneath the surface?  The townspeople are initially wary of their new visitor, but as John questions their way of life, some of them begin to have questions of their own. As the leadership's tight control unravels, men and women break free from the chains of legalism-some literally, and some at the cost of their own lives.

Thaddeus J. Kozinski suggests that critiques of liberalism must find their resolution in the idea of a confessional state. Those of us who disagree will be forced to offer equally rigorous defenses of a Christian politics that is neither liberal nor state-centered. Any contemporary vision of a theological politics must take this book's stimulating and provocative argument into account."" William T. Cavanaugh. Center for World Catholicism and Intercultural Theology and DePaul University"" """"This work brings the theories of John Rawls, Jacques Maritain, and Alasdair MacIntyre into dialogue and reaches the conclusion that there are problems within the realm of political theory that cannot be solved philosophically--solutions need to be found elsewhere. Kozinski's book is on the cutting edge of a new generation of Catholic political theory and will be valuable for students of political theory everywhere regardless of their theological backgrounds."" Tracty Rowland, John Paul II Institute"" """"A sophisticated, cumulative case for the moral limitations and metaphysical bankruptcy of liberal political philosophy--even in its Catholic (Maritainian) form. Drawing on the much-discussed MacIntyre but going beyond him, the author shows why civil society and the State need a sacral key stone to complete the arch of a comprehensive human good."" Aidan Nichols, OP, Blackfriars Cambridge"".--P. [4] of cover.  ""In contemporary political philosophy there is much debate over how to maintain a public order in pluralistic democracies in which citizens hold radically different religious views. The Political Problem of Religious Pluralism deals with this theoretically and practically difficult issue by examining three of the most influential figures of religious pluralism theory: John Rawls, Jacques Maritain, and Alasdair MacIntyre. Kozinski addresses the flaws in each philosopher's views and shows that the only philosophically defensible end of any overlapping consensus political order must be the eradication of the ideological pluralism that makes it necessary.""--Page 4 of cover.

Tarcher/Penguin|Language English|Pages 480","A comprehensive single-volume reference guide to the terms and ideas of Kabbalah by a longtime teacher of Jewish mysticism -perfect for the serious student and newcomer alike.People of all faiths and backgrounds are drawn to the inspiration, knowledge, and spiritual insight that Kabbalah offers. But too often writings on Jewish mysticism are impenetrable for the novice, overly simplified for the advanced student, or misrepresent and sensationalize Kabbalistic practice. The Kabbalah Handbook is the first comprehensive single-volume Kabbalah reference guide that is indispensable for Kabbalah students of every level. The Kabbalah Handbook features: - more than five hundred key terms and concepts in straightforward, easy-to-read definitions and thorough, well-researched discussions;- Hebrew, English, and Hebrew transliteration for each item;- the language of origin for each term;- a discussion of all sides of differing opinions within Kabbalistic philosophy;- pronunciation guides;- nondiscriminatory, gender-neutral language;- important historical information;- extensive cross-referencing that enables readers to find all terms, whether they are looking up a word in English or transliterated Hebrew;- twenty-eight original and innovative illustrations;- thirty-two tables and charts that organize and break down unwieldy material into manageable items; and- appendices covering topics such as the 613 Mitzvot (biblical commandments), the lunar calendar, and the sacred names of God.

The spread of this principle has resulted in five hundred years of remarkable innovation and adaptability, but it has also created cultural incoherence and social instability. Without any overarching authority to rein in ""wayward"" thought, opposing sides on controversial issues can only appeal to the Bible—yet the Bible is open to many diverse interpretations. Christianity's Dangerous Idea is the first book that attempts to define this core element of Protestantism and the religious and cultural dynamic that this dangerous idea unleashed, culminating in the remarkable new developments of the twentieth century.At a time when Protestants will soon cease to be the predominant faith tradition in the United States, McGrath's landmark reassessment of the movement and its future is well-timed. Replete with helpful modern-day examples that explain the past, McGrath brings to life the Protestant movements and personalities that shaped history and the central Christian idea that continues to dramatically influence world events today.

Arguments in the Timaeus, Sophist, Statesman, Philebus, and Laws X are analyzed with an eye to problems which affect the wider understanding of Plato's metaphysics, theology, epistemology, psychology, and physics. New interpretations are given to Plato's views on the role and characteristics of his craftsman God, the nature and status of Forms, the nature of time and eternity, the status and nature of space and the phenomenal realm, and the nature of and relations between reason, souls, bodies, and motion. The book is critically sympathetic to the Platonic project, at least to the extent that it argues that many (though not all) features of the Platonic cosmology are more intelligible and coherent than usually supposed by critics. It defends the view that for Plato God makes the world in the way that a carpenter cuts a board to be exactly a yard long - by applying a yard stick to the board and removing the excess wood. This view of a making requires that there be standards or measures that exist independently both of the agent who creates and the world on which he works. These standards are Plato's Forms. Transcendent Forms cannot be excised from the Platonic metaphysics as many modern critics have been trying to do in an attempt to make Plato respectable by today's criteria of philosophical decency. This work presents a revised and updated edition of the author's 1985 book The Platonic Cosmology (E.J. Brill, Leiden) together with four revised and updated essays by the author on Plato's metaphysics, and a wholly new essay, ""Extensions,"" which expands the themes of the book into wider philosophical contexts.

Finding the right church home can be a huge challenge, and also a lot of fun.  Kevin and Sherry Harney point out that, while no church is perfect, some will fit you better than others. They show what a healthy church looks like, how to handle hot issues facing churches today, and how to determine whether a church's unique worship style will inspire or distract you. Even better, the Harneys help you discover how to plug into a church and experience the joy of giving back.  In the words of the authors, 'Church can be one of the most joy-filled, life-giving experiences you will ever have.' Practical, encouraging, and true to the Bible, this book is your road map to finding a spiritual community you can really love.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Or is God nothing more than your 'imaginary friend,' like a playmate contrived by a lonely and imaginative child?  When author Sam Harris attacked Christianity in Letter to a Christian Nation, reviewers called the book 'marvelous' and a generation of readers---hundreds of thousands of them---were drawn to his message. Deeply troubled, Dr. Ravi Zacharias knew that he had to respond. In The End of Reason, Zacharias underscores the dependability of the Bible along with his belief in the power and goodness of God. He confidently refutes Harris's claims that God is nothing more than a figment of one's imagination and that Christians regularly practice intolerance and hatred around the globe.  If you found Sam Harris's Letter to a Christian Nation compelling, the book you are holding is exactly what you need.  Dr. Zacharias exposes 'the utter bankruptcy of this worldview.'  And if you haven't read Harris' book, Ravi's response remains a powerful, passionate, irrefutably sound set of arguments for Christian thought. The clarity and hope in these pages reach out to readers who know and follow God as well as to those who reject God.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Linda Vujnov has been there and knows exactly what it feels like. As she recounts the continuing adventures of parenting her four children, Maddy, Zack, Ty, and Carson, she offers a quirky, down-to-earth perspective on life for mothers who need to be reminded that God's grace is always there, even when things don't work out exactly as you had originally planned.  Spilt Milk is a collection of brief, hilarious stories mixed with biblically based applications that will encourage busy mothers in their spiritual journey. Each chapter includes a corresponding Scripture verse intended to support the lesson learned from the experience. Written by a Gen-X mom, these stories remind us that, even in the midst of the questions, the craziness, the wonder of raising kids, and the joy of being a wife, God is right there alongside us to help us cope with life's little messes and mix-ups.

Though all three solutions are rejected in their best-known forms, three new solutions are proposed,and Zagzebski concludes that divine foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom.  The discussion includes the relation between the foreknowledge dilemma and problems about the nature of time and the causal relation; the logic of counterfactual conditionals; and the differences between divine andhuman knowing states.  An appendix introduces a new foreknowledge dilemma that purports to show that omniscient foreknowledge conflicts with deep intuitions about temporal asymmetry, quite apart from considerations of free will.  Zagzebski shows that only a narrow range of solutions can handle thisnew dilemma...   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Vilified throughout history as the ""Apostate,"" the young philosopher-warrior was the last and arguably the most potent threat to Christianity. The Last Pagan examines Julian's journey from an aristocratic Christian childhood to his initiation into pagan cults and his mission to establish paganism as the dominant faith of the Roman world. Julian's death, only two years into his reign, initiated a culture-wide suppression by the Church of all things it chose to identify as pagan. Only in recent decades, with the weakening of the Church's influence and the resurgence of paganism, have the effects of that suppression begun to wane. Drawing upon more than 700 pages of Julian's original writings, Adrian Murdoch shows that had Julian lived longer our history and our present-day culture would likely be very different. - Back cover.

Raised in liberal Ashland, Oregon, by parents who were Jewish by birth but dismissive of strict dogma, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross converted to Islam in college-a process that began with a desire to connect with both a religious community and a spiritual practice, and eventually led him to sympathize with the most extreme interpretations of the faith with the most radical political implications. In the year following graduation, Gartenstein-Ross went to work for the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, a charity dedicated to fostering Wahhabism, Saudi Arabia's austere form of Islam-a theological inspiration for many terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda. Shortly after he left Al Haramain-when his own fanaticism had waned-the foundation was charged by the U. S. government for a money-laundering scheme that was seemingly designed to finance terrorist organizations. Gartenstein-Ross, by this time a lawyer at a prominent firm, volunteered for questioning by the FBI. They already knew who he was. The story of how a good faith can be distorted and a decent soul can be seduced away from his principles, My Year Inside Radical Islam provides a rare glimpse into the personal interface between religion and politics.

But when we speak of ""expectation"" of the world's end we are mindful of the fact that generation after generation of millenarians have been disappointed. Their endtime hopes and prophecies have not come true. What happens, one might ask, when prophecies fail? Does failure spell the end of the very movements that embrace such expectations?  The aim of this anthology is to gather together in one volume the essential research from the fields of sociology and psychology that seeks to answer this intriguing question as first raised by Festinger in his 1956 work, When Prophecy Fails. Cross-cultural and comparative, this collection chronicles forty years of research into failed prophecy and response to the attending cognitive dissonance it produces that is at once timely and informative.

With sessions to cover 6 weeks this guide can be used for individual or group study during lent.    Jesus The Wounded Saviour, seeks to help you to explore issues in the light of the resserection power of Jesus, including humiliation, lonliness, temptaion, and breavement and to enable you to experience his wonderful comfort and the strength he imparts to face life's problems.

Minoan Kingship and the Solar Goddess: A Near Eastern Koine,Nanno Marinatos,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL4284199W,/authors/OL831068A/Nanno_Marinatos,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  University of Illinois Press|Language English|Pages 280,"Ancient Minoan culture has been typically viewed as an ancestor of classical Greek civilization, but this book shows that Minoan Crete was on the periphery of a powerfully dynamic cultural interchange with its neighbors. Rather than viewing Crete as the autochthonous ancestor of Greece's glory, Nanno Marinatos considers ancient Crete in the context of its powerful competitors to the east and south.  Analyzing the symbols of the Minoan theocratic system and their similarities to those of Syria, Anatolia, and Egypt, Marinatos unlocks many Minoan visual riddles and establishes what she calls a ""cultural koine,"" or standard set of cultural assumptions, that circulated throughout the Near East and the eastern Mediterranean at the time Minoan civilization reached its peak. With more than one hundred and fifty illustrations, Minoan Kingship and the Solar Goddess delivers a comprehensive reading of Minoan art as a system of thought.

J. David Velleman shows that different communities can indeed be subject to incompatible moralities, because their local mores are rationally binding. At the same time, he explains why the mores of different communities, even when incompatible, are still variations on the same moral themes. The book thus maps out a universe of many moral worlds without, as Velleman puts it, """"moral black holes”. The six self-standing chapters discuss such diverse topics as online avatars and virtual worlds, lying in Russian and truth-telling in Quechua, the pleasure of solitude and the fear of absurdity. Accessibly written, this book presupposes no prior training in philosophy. ""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Could Neanderthals talk? Was Ardi self-conscious? These are the strange new breed of questions emerging as we discover more and more about our prehistoric origins--questions about knowing. While fossil digs and carbon dating tell a remarkable story about the bones and times of our ancient ancestors, we cannot help wondering what they knew, and when. Exploring such questions Original Knowing takes contemporary science as seriously as religious tradition and searches for the story behind this odd creature who senses more to the universe than meets the eye. In limestone bluffs and butterfly migrations, from Stone Age tool-making to Sumerian beer-making, clues are sought to better understand this strange mind that ponders the origins of its own existence. When do babies point, and why does it matter? What does throwing a Frisbee reveal about our distant ancestors? Is language the key to our minds as many believe? Or perhaps the heart of knowing rests in something more basic, in a smile, and the powerful social abilities at work allowing us to sense a depth to life--to our own lives--a depth that our minds help us glimpse if only through a glass darkly.""--Publisher's website.

In Falling Upward, Fr. Richard Rohr seeks to help readers understand the tasks of the two halves of life and to show them that those who have fallen, failed, or ""gone down"" are the only ones who understand ""up."" Most of us tend to think of the second half of life as largely about getting old, dealing with health issues, and letting go of life, but the whole thesis of this book is exactly the opposite.? What looks like falling down can largely be experienced as ""falling upward.""? In fact, it is not a loss but somehow actually a gain, as we have all seen with elders who?have come to their fullness.?? Explains why the second half of life can and should be full of spiritual richness Offers a new view of how spiritual growth happens loss is gain Richard Rohr is a regular contributing writer for Sojourners and Tikkun magazines This important book explores the counterintuitive message that we grow spiritually much more by doing wrong than by doing right.""--   Read more Read less",20 Want to read|3 Currently reading|2 Have read

In fact, it would be fair to say that Latin American Christianity has been transformed definitively in the years since the Second Vatican Council. Religious change has not been obvious because its transformation has not been, as in Africa and Asia, the sudden and massive growth of a new religion. It has been rather a simultaneous revitalization and fragmentation that threatened, awakened, and ultimately brought to a greater maturity a dormant and parochial Christianity. The rapid growth of Protestantism, especially Pentecostalism, forced Catholics to adopt a more active and dynamic approach to their religion. Although many Catholics left their church to become Pentecostals, many others responded to the Protestant challenge by joining new Catholic movements. Today, Latin American Christianity is so energized that the region is sending missionaries to Africa, Europe, and the United States. In The Rebirth of Latin American Christianity, Todd Hartch examines the changes that have swept across Latin America in the last fifty years and situates them in the context of the growth of Christianity in the global South. - Back cover.

Nash Lee, an NGO entrepreneur, is determined to make a difference through his worldwide mVillage network. Kim Grace, a nuclear scientist imprisoned in North Korea's secret Camp 16, knows the truth about the devastating technology she helped develop.

Muhammad tries to convert his roommate, but he is the one who is converted.    In Islam changing one's religion is a crime, and Muhammad's family does everything possible to make him renounce his new faith in Christ. After threats and blows come prison and torture. Muhammad, who has become Joseph by his baptism, experiences a long Calvary but does not give in. Finally, he is taken from prison by relatives who threaten to kill him if he does not resubmit to Islam. They shoot him and leave him for dead.  The Price to Pay is the true story of Joseph Fadelle's conversion to Catholicism. He risks everything--family, friends, his inheritance and home, and even his life--in order to follow Christ. In a dramatic and personal narrative style, Fadelle reveals the horrible persecution endured by Christians living in a violent and hostile Muslim world.

The Case for Civility is a proposal for restoring civility in America as a way to foster civility around the world. Influential Christian writer and speaker Os Guinness makes a passionate plea to put an end to the polarization of American politics and culture that—rather than creating a public space for real debate—threatens to reverse the very principles our founders set into motion and that have long preserved liberty, diversity, and unity in this country.Guinness takes on the contemporary threat of the excesses of the Religious Right and the secular Left, arguing that we must find a middle ground between privileging one religion over another and attempting to make all public expression of faith illegal. If we do not do this, Guinness contends, Western civilization as we know it will die. Always provocative and deeply insightful, Guinness puts forth a vision of a new, practical ""civil and cosmopolitan public square"" that speaks not only to America's immediate concerns but to the long-term interests of the republic and the world.

Almost two decades on, Science and Religion: New Historical Perspectives revisits this argument and asks how historians can now impose order on the complex and contingent histories of religious engagements with science. Bringing together leading scholars, this new volume explores the history and changing meanings of the categories 'science' and 'religion'; the role of publishing and education in forging and spreading ideas; the connection between knowledge, power and intellectual imperialism; and the reasons for the confrontation between evolution and creationism among American Christians and in the Islamic world. A major contribution to the historiography of science and religion, this book makes the most recent scholarship on this much misunderstood debate widely accessible""--Provided by publisher.

Alliant simplicité et prestige, humilité et ascendant, ouverture et refus, physique ordinaire et rayonnement exceptionnel, François répond aux attentes d'une grande partie de ses contemporains. Son premier terrain d'apostolat est la ville, à laquelle il apporte le sens de la pauvreté face à l'argent et aux riches, la paix au lieu des luttes intestines. À la nouvelle société urbaine qui s'installe, il propose l'alternance entre l'action dans la ville et le retrait érémitique, mais aussi la route et le pèlerinage. Enfin, désireux de montrer que des laïcs sont capables, comme les clercs, de mener une vie apostolique, il refuse dans son ordre toute hiérarchie et prélature, et fait leur place aux femmes et aux enfants.    François, plus que tout autre, inspire à l'historien le désir d'en faire un objet d'histoire totale, exemplaire pour le passé et le présent.

Theo ist 14 Jahre alt und lebt in Paris. Und wenn er nicht gerade seinen Kopf in Bücher steckt, sitzt er vor dem Computer und versucht das Rätsel des Tages zu lösen, das ihm seine Computerfreundin Pythia stellt. In Theos Leben gibt es noch seine senegalesische Freundin Fatou, seine griechische Mutter Melina, seinen französischen Vater Jérôme und seine beiden Schwestern.Seine Tante Marthe will ihm helfen. Sie schenkt ihm eine Weltreise zu den Religionen der Welt und hofft, seine Krankheit auf diese Weise heilen zu können. Die beiden machen sich also auf den Weg, um Judentum, Islam, Christentum, Buddhismus und weitere Religionen näher kennenzulernen. Ihre Reise führt sie unter anderem nach Jerusalem, Kairo, Tokio, New York und Rom und viele Städte mehr.Überall treffen er und Tante Marthe kundige Führer, die ihn sogar an den wichtigsten Festen und Riten teilnehmen lassen. Bei einem dieser Riten erfährt Theo, dass seine Zwillingsschwester kurz nach der Geburt gestorben ist.  Als sein morgendlicher Schwindel nicht nachlässt, erfährt Theo nach einem Arzttermin, dass er schwer krank ist. Eine mysteriöse Krankheit, die schlimmstenfalls mit dem Tod enden kann. Die Ärzte sind machtlos.Dann tritt seine Tante Marthe auf den Plan. Marthe ist Jeromes Schwester und eine sehr reiche Witwe, die ein wenig exzentrisch ist.    Sie scheucht Theo von seinem Krankenlager und teilt ihm mit, dass sie mit ihm zusammen eine Reise zu den Religionen der Welt machen wird. Welches die einzelnen Etappen der Reise sind muss Theo anhand von rätselhaften Botschaften erraten. Er bekommt aber Hilfestellung von Fatou, die man zu Theos Pythia (Orakel der griech. Mythologie) gemacht hat.  Die 1. Etappe ihrer Reise ist Jerusalem. Dort wohnen die Beiden beim französischen Konsul. In Jerusalem stellt Tante Marthe ihm Rabbi Elieser, Vater Dubourg und Sultan Suleyman vor. Alle 3 sind alte Freunde von Marthe und sollen Theo, der keinerlei religiöse Vorbildung besitzt, das Zusammenspiel der 3 großen Religionen – Judentum, Christentum und Islam – in Israel erklären. Jeder der 3 Männer zeigt Theo, die für seine Religion heiligen Stätten in Jerusalem. Ein Highlight dieser Etappe ist die Heilige Nacht, die Theo in der Geburtskirche in Bethlehem feiern darf.  Die 2. Etappe ist Kairo. Dort werden sie herzlich von Amal, Professorin für griechische Kultur an der Azhar Universität, aufgenommen. Da Theo von jeher eine große Vorliebe für die ägyptische Mythologie hatte, ist er dort natürlich in seinem Element. Dort besichtigt er natürlich die bedeutenden Bauwerke bei einer kleinen Rundreise. Während dieser Reise lernt er Herrn Laplace kennen, ein Freund von Amal und Archäologe. Theo versteht sich auf Anhieb mit ihm.     Amal arrangiert eine Heilungszeremonie bei einer Scheika. Theo fällt während dieser Zeremonie in Trance und trifft auf seinen Zwilling aus der Unterwelt, der ihn nun führen will. Dies beunruhigt Tante Marthe sehr, denn Theo hatte tatsächlich eine Zwillingsschwester, die bei der Geburt starb. Melina, Theos Mutter, wollte aber nie, dass er davon erfährt.  Die 3. Etappe führt sie nach Rom, wo Kardinal Levi ihr Führer ist. Theo darf den Vatikan besichtigen und erfährt einiges über die Geschichte Roms und die der Christen.  Theos reist mit seiner Tante noch nach Delhi, Benares, Jakarta, Tokio, Moskau, Istanbul, Dakar, Lissabon, Rom und zum Schluss nach New York. Während dieser Reise hat er kompetente Führer, die ihm die Geschichte, Mythologie und Religion des jeweiligen Ortes nahe bringen. Die etwas exzentrische Tante Marthe, die keiner Religion zugeneigt ist, hat natürlich so ihre eigenen Ansichten zu den Dingen und dadurch entspinnen sich amüsante Streitgespräche. Während dieser Reise muss Theo natürlich immer wieder Untersuchungen über sich ergehen lassen. Tante Marthe ermuntert ihn aber immer wieder auch alternative Heilverfahren zu probieren.

Even though it is the wellspring of our transgressions, we are apt to overlook its devastating impact and view sin as a life-long list of errant acts, believing we can become better Christians by committing fewer of them. The purpose of this book is to reexamine how sin came into the world through Adam and how the Lord has redeemed us by His grace through faith from this formidable adversary ""crouching at the door"". This refreshing reexamination of one tumultuous afternoon in the Garden of Eden will forever change the way you look at sin and salvation. - Back cover.

National Geographic concise history of world religions,Tim Cooke,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL16604869W,/authors/OL46763A/Tim_Cooke,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  National Geographic|Language English|Pages 352,"""Religion lies at the heart of the human experience. The great faiths-- Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism-- together may account for up to six billion of the world's nearly seven billion people. For all the differences between their beliefs-- or between them and followers of Japanese Shinto or animistic faiths in Africa-- these adherents seek the same fulfilment [sic] from their religious experience: a feeling of connection with the universe, an understanding of their purpose, a moral code, a sense of fellowship, and a sense of the supernatural. As Concise history of world religions shows, such human yearning has inspired many different forms of faith, from the myths of the ancient Egyptians to the storefront churches of San Francisco in the 1960s. The majority of the world's faiths have disappeared; as the timelines reveal, even those that have survived have done so in a constant state of change as the world itself has changed. The universal truths of scripture have undergone review and reinterpretation. Visionary individuals have changed the direction of many churches. Political events have dragged even faiths that profess peace and universal brotherhood into visceral violence and bitterness. Churches have split and formed splinter congregations (some destined to be short-lived, such as the Shakers of 19th-century America, who insisted on celibacy, or the Russian Skoptsy, who reinforced biblical injunctions against lust by practicing male castration). Generations of believers have attempted to revive what they see as purer forms of religious practice from the past. Artists, architects, composers, and writers have been inspired to celebrate their gods. Such is the power of faith that even many of those who reject the idea of the divine adopt their own forms of religious codes, arguing that morality is not the exclusive preserve of the believer. Concise history of world religions does not ignore the problems and divisions faith has caused, nor the various secular movements that challenge it. But above all it is a celebration of the enduring power of belief and the fact that the optimism and comfort it offers, although it has on occasion been something to kill for, has far more often been something to live for--the framework that makes sense of everything""--Foreword, p. 8.

This much maligned and controversial gift was a practical part of their worship and intercession and seeks to be rediscovered in our day.In a day of spiritual poverty, Chavda challenges the Body of Christ to experience afresh the secret dynamic of 'speaking in tongues', as he removes the veil covering this glorious gift.

She overcame an abused childhood, a bad marriage and extremely limited opportunities to become one of the most popular author/speakers in the world. Joyce Meyer Ministries  was the first ministry in America  to be headed by a woman, and it's one of the largest in the world.  If anyone knows how to hold on to a dream and realize it, it's her. Packed with examples of people who pursued their goals relentlessly, the book profiles nearly fifty individuals who prevailed against all odds. From the builder of the Brooklyn Bridge to the chemists who invented Post-It notes we meet people like Bessie Coleman, an African-American who had to go to flight school in Paris in order to learn how to fly.

In reality, queerness and queer Judaism have been a constant subplot of Jewish history, if only we care to look.  Spanning almost two millennia and containing translations from more than a dozen languages, Noam Sienna's new book, A Rainbow Thread: An Anthology of Queer Jewish Texts From the First Century to 1969, collects for the first time more than a hundred sources on the intersection of Jewish and queer identities.  Covering poetry, drama, literature, law, midrash, and memoir, this anthology suggests that Jewish texts are not just obstacles to be overcome in the creation of queer Jewish life, but also potential resources waiting to be excavated. Through an unprecedented examination of the histories of gender and sexuality over two millennia of Jewish life around the world, this book inspires and challenges its readers to create a better future through a purposeful reflection on our past.

He loved to hunt and fish and explore the Kentucky woods, but for him, existence on this earth was about denying the pleasures of this life in preparation for the next. Eriks father was a Baptist minister, too. But at the age of thirty-threenot coincidentally, Jesus age when he was crucified Eriks father violently took his own life, and Erik ended up spending much of his childhood in the care of his grandparents.So, while Erik grew up with a conflicted relationship with Christianity, he also grew up with an acute awareness of a part of the country suffering ongoing economic, environmental, and even spiritual collapse. When he himself neared age thirty-three, he found unexpected comfort and guidance in his intellectual hero Thomas Jeffersons famous Jefferson Bible, especially when he began to track similarities between it and the Zen-like message of the Gospel of Thomas. Inspired, he undertook what would become a spiritual and literary questto identify an American gospel coursing through the work of both great and forgotten American geniuses, from William Byrd to Walt Whitman to William James to Lynn Margulis. In synthesizing that gospelone that prizes the pleasures and glories of this earthReece began to find a way to a spiritual and intellectual peace with his own American soul.The result of Reeces journey is a deeply personal but also deeply thought out, inspiring, and stirring book, delivered almost like a secular sermon, about personal, political, and historical demonsand the geniuses we can and must call on to combat them.

The author sets a magical mood as he describes his early years in ""Snowland"" (Tibet) as one of seven children of a renowned Nyingma master.

USING PATIENT CARE SITUATIONS TO APPLY KOHLBERG'S MORAL DEVELOPMENT THEORY TO NURSING (ETHICS),Gina Giovinco,religion,First published in 1985,/works/OL12262259W,/authors/OL5354803A/Gina_Giovinco,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1985|Pages 121,"The purpose of this study is to show how patient care situations can be used to apply the Kohlberg theory of moral development to nursing education and practice. This study is philosophical in nature and directed primarily to nurses and secondarily to related health professionals. The theoretical bases are found primarily in Kolhberg's theory of moral development and in Rogers' (1961, 1971) and King's (1971, 1981) theories of nursing.  There are concerns expressed by many nurse leaders that nurses are not being prepared educationally to deal with the increasing number of moral conflicts encountered in the practice of nursing. Many of these concerns are echoed by the nurse in her day-to-day practice of nursing. Increasing technology is enabling medical science to intervene in human life in ways that are raising new moral questions for all of the health professions. The ultimate goal of any profession is to improve the practice of its members so that the services provided to their clients will produce the greatest benefits. Any profession seeking to enhance its professional image undertakes the continuous development of a body of knowledge fundamental to its practice.  The need for increased attention by programs of nursing education to moral development and to bioethical decision-making skills is evidenced in a study by M. Aroskar, R.N., Ph.D. (1977). Aroskar conducted a study of accredited baccalaureate nursing curricula in the late spring of 1976, with the cooperation of the Hastings Center Institute for Society, Ethics and Life Sciences. The purpose was to identify whether and, if so, how moral issues were included in nursing programs and to consider implications for further development of nursing curricula to include values and ethics in the nursing context. Aroskar's study reveals that respondents lack a body of knowledge about the theoretical base for bioethical decision-making in nursing.  The Hastings Center Commission on the Teaching of Bioethics has documented the lack of teaching of bioethics in nursing education. The Commission stated that ""since there are virtually no trained teachers with adequate skills in both clinical aspects of nursing and ethics training, opportunities for faculty development must be given especially high priority (The Hastings Center, 1976, p.4)."".  In Chapter I, the articulation between Kohlberg's theory of moral development and Rogers' and King's theories of nursing is introduced within the context of nursing education and practice. Chapter II focuses on the implicit moral dimensions of nursing theory, working principally from the theories of M. Rogers (1961, 1971) and I. King (1971, 1981). Chapter III is a purely expository summary of L. Kohlberg's theory of moral development. Chapter IV develops, along Kohlbergian lines, several significant patient care situations involving bioethical issues in nursing and shows how they can be used in nursing education and practice. Chapter V presents a summary, conclusions, and suggestions for further study. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.).   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Faith-based diplomacy and interfaith dialogue,Scott Blakemore,religion,First published in 2019,/works/OL32407267W,/authors/OL11755669A/Scott_Blakemore,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Brill|Language English|Pages 124,"Scholars are seeking to identify how to constructively integrate faith into diplomacy. Proponents of faith-based diplomacy recognise that incorporating faith into peacemaking activities assists in managing identity-based conflict and religiously motivated violence in the contemporary international system. A promising strategy within the scope of faith-based diplomacy is interfaith dialogue. The study and practice of interfaith dialogue has been reinvigorated since the advent of 9/11, and yet the link between interfaith dialogue and diplomacy remains underdeveloped. The cases of Indonesia and the United States present lessons on how states can effectively use interfaith dialogue to achieve policy objectives, while recognising that some policies are detrimental to achieving diplomatic goals. This paper seeks to provide some framework for bringing interfaith dialogue into the scope of diplomacy by illuminating how faith-based diplomacy and interfaith dialogue can be innovative diplomatic perspectives useful in addressing contemporary global issues.

The critical way in religion,Duncan Howlett,religion,First published in 1980,/works/OL3496086W?edition=ia%3Acriticalwayinrel0000howl,/authors/OL583994A/Duncan_Howlett,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL4094704M-M.jpg,Publish Date 1980|Publisher  Prometheus Books|Language English|Pages 360,"In The Critical Way in Religion, Duncan Howlett proposes a new approach to the age-old question of religious belief. According to the author, authority and tradition cannot provide adequate answers for religion, nor can modern liberalism. These approaches fail to come to terms with the problems of human error and the need for innovation. Organized religion has not subjected its claim to know eternal truth to the severe testing accepted in all other disciplines and has been highly resistant to the introduction of new practices and patterns of thought. The Critical Way in Religion identifies a religious tradition older than Christianity and at least as old as Judaism that has taken human fallibility and human resourcefulness fully into account. The author traces the evolution of this tradition from its beginning in Greece in the sixth century B.C. and shows how its characteristic principles have developed. Today, although worldwide in scope but by no means universally accepted, the critical approach to religion is found inside as well as outside organized religion, among churchgoers and among the supposedly nonreligious as well. Howlett maintains that the critical tradition in religion developed independent of the Judeo-Christian tradition but that the two are closely related. The critical tradition has its heroes, its martyrs, and a growing body of thought, but as yet no name and no church fully committed to it. Although the modern worldwide university system is the critical spirit institutionalized, it is primarily nonreligious. This book calls for the institutionalizing of the critical spirit in religion and concludes with a set of clear and positive, yet critical, religious principles. - Back cover.

Syncretisme,,religion,First published in 2017,/works/OL32740118W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Peeters|Language French|Pages 367,"Syncrétisme et inculturation : ces deux termes proviennent de disciplines distinctes ; ils suggèrent des perspectives différentes et souvent ressenties comme contradictoires. Au regard de l?évangélisation, l?inculturation est volontiers présentée comme un but à atteindre tandis que le syncrétisme est souvent synonyme de tromperie et de compromission. Identité et métissage, fidélité et changement, cohérence et bricolage : ces questions ne sont pas neuves mais elles se posent aujourd?hui à l?échelle mondiale et dans des sociétés en transformation rapide. 0Dès l?origine, les communautés chrétiennes ont dû se définir face au judaïsme et aux paganismes. L?histoire montre que le christianisme n?a jamais cessé de se recontextualiser. L?anthropologie et la sociologie mettent en lumière des situations bien spécifiques : Afrique occidentale et centrale, Amérique Latine, Europe... La théologie explore le rapport aux sources de la foi et l?inscription changeante dans les cultures. Et c?est bien entendu dans le champ des pratiques que surgissent les défis et que des réponses sont attendues : sacrements et rites de passage, pédagogie et transmission du message, construction d?une spiritualité personnelle. Les arts ? en particulier les arts visuels ? sont un bon révélateur des échecs et des promesses de l?inculturation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Safeguarding the stranger,Jayme Reaves,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL20974981W,/authors/OL8024897A/Jayme_Reaves,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Pickwick Publications|Language English|Pages 299,"What are the resources and teachings in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam that take hospitality--and its call to provide protective hospitality--seriously enough to inform shared action and belief on behalf of the threatened other? This book argues that protective hospitality and its faith-based foundations as seen in the Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam merit greater theological attention and that the practice of protective hospitality in Christianity can be enhanced by better understandings of Judaism's and Islam's practices of hospitality, namely their codes and etiquettes related to honor. Safeguarding the Stranger draws especially on two currents in contemporary Christian theologies: (1) a contextual and political theological approach informed by liberation and feminist theologies, and (2) a cooperative and complementary theological approach informed by interreligious, Abrahamic, and hospitable approaches to dialogue. This book is unique in that it seeks to contribute to academic debates within theology and religious dialogue as well as to discussions within the fields of peace studies and conflict resolution on the positive role that religions might play in contexts of conflict. -- back cover.

Domestic Devotions in Early Modern Italy,,religion,,/works/OL20928437W,,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Brill|Language English|Pages 468,"Domestic Devotions in Early Modern Italy illuminates the vibrancy of spiritual beliefs and practices which profoundly shaped family life in this era. Scholarship on Catholicism has tended to focus on institutions, but the home was the site of religious instruction and reading, prayer and meditation, communal worship, multi-sensory devotions, contemplation of religious images and the performance of rituals, as well as extraordinary events such as miracles. Drawing on a wide range of sources, this volume affirms the central place of the household to spiritual life and reveals the myriad ways in which devotion met domestic needs. The seventeen essays encompass religious history, the histories of art and architecture, material culture, musicology, literary history, and social and cultural history.

Early academic study of Hinduism was overwhelmingly a study of texts, and while a strong philological tradition continues to characterise much work on Hinduism (in particular in Indology), very different materials and questions animate debates among anthropologists, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and others. The result is that Hindu institutions such as temples are understood quite differently by those who focus on their political, economic, religious, or aesthetic dimensions. Valuable contributions are also beginning to appear in emergent fields as diverse as cognitive science and constructive Hindu theology. While many works in these fields are published in Europe or North America, significant work appears in journals and books published in India which remain hard to access elsewhere. The collection is fully indexed and supplemented with a comprehensive introduction, newly written by the editor, which places the gathered materials in their historical and intellectual context""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

One is the “science and religion dialogue,” stretching from the laboratories of Nobelists to the inner sancta of the Vatican, an effort to build bridges between two worlds formerly thought to be incompatible and implacably hostile. The other is the intelligent design movement, which by reviving a natural theology of design in nature has challenged the Darwinian strongholds in science and public education. After reading By Design, we understand how what was once a battleground between God and science is now becoming a meeting ground.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What does Scripture actually teach about deacons and their role in the church? Views range from deacons being the board of directors, to the church building maintenance crew. My intention in writing this book is to encourage my deacon friends and fellow church leaders to think more critically about what they are saying, what they are doing, and what Scripture actually teaches about deacons. Whatever your view, I urge you to use this study to examine in detail the biblical facts on deacons, allowing those facts to guide your thinking about deacons. This close look at the key texts offers Christians an opportunity to build broader agreement among our Bible-believing churches as to what deacons do. - Back cover.

In previous era, it was possible to achieve instant enlightenment simply by meeting a Tirthankara. At present, such sudden enlightenment is not possible here on earth.  In the current era, one seeking spiritual awakening can search for spiritual teachers to understand the meaning of spirituality and its transformation, but to attain Self realization one must meet a living Gnani Purush (the enlightened one).  A living Gnani has the spiritual power both to give spiritual enlightenment, and to connect one with Tirthankaras of the present, such as Simandhar Swami of Mahavideh Kshetra.  In the book “The Current Living Tirthankara Shree Simandhar Swami”, Gnani Purush offers spiritual guidance about Self realization, and how to connect with Simandhar Swami for the sake of ultimate liberation (moksha).

Birth, education, job, marriage, kids, family and at the end…death! Is this the standard cycle of life that has to be followed? What is the ultimate goal of such a life? Why do we take birth? What do we want?  The human body that we have received... should do the duty of being humane. There should be humanity in life. But what is humanity?  According to Param Pujya Dadashri, the Gnani Purush (the enlightened One). The definition of humanity is that when someone hurts you, troubles you, you don’t like it. Hence, you should also not hurt anyone. That, according to Him, is the biggest humanity. Whoever understands this and applies it in life means he knows what is humanity.  Getting a human body means one is free to go to any is one of the four forms of life (gattis). One is human form, the other three being – animal form, devgatti (heaven/celestial being) and narak gatti (hell/beast form).  Whatever are the causes so are the effect. If we show humanity, we will get a human body in the next birth. If we are inhumane, we will be re-born in the animal form. If we are extremely bad and inhumane then we are re-born in narak gatti. If we spend our life in doing good for others and help them without any expectations then we get a life in devgatti.  In this book, Param Pujya Dadashri has discussed the concepts of humanity with the humble intention that if people learn about humanity then their human life will be fruitful.

How do you know if someone is telling the truth about God? And how should you respond if they are not? Every Christian is responsible for knowing God's Word and sharing it with others. But in a world affected by sin, false teaching is everywhere. Many people obscure, distort, or challenge what God has revealed in Scripture -- even some leaders in the church. To be better prepared as witnesses for Christ, we must identify falsehood and the devastating harm it brings. By surveying prominent theological errors, cults, and world religions, this book can equip you to defend your faith against the dangers of false teaching. It can also help you more effectively respond to your friends, family, and neighbors with the hope you have in Christ. - Back cover.

In una terra martoriata da guerre e dominazioni ma di salda fede in Dio è avvenuto un evento che ha attirato ed attira ancora oggi tantissime persone; alcuni ragazzi dicono di avere delle visioni.

Anche coloro che non credono in Dio hanno dentro di se ciò che viene chiamato sentimento, vi chiedo di analizzare le cose con gli occhi del cuore e scoprirete che c'è ben altro oltre l'apparente.    Escludere a priori ciò che non si capisce, non si vede o non si conosce è di fatto una non scelta, perché ogni vera scelta implica un insieme di cose conosciute tra cui scegliere.

Is faith a work, or is it a gift? What is the role of human responsibility in all of this? In The Faith Response, John Van Gelderen addresses this confusion by outlining a proper, biblical understanding of the nature of faith, which is true God-dependence -- realizing ""I can't, but God can"" -- and he doesn't stop there. In later chapters he makes practical application of this truth to our daily walk with God, showing how dependence on God is wrapped up in the secret of  ""Christ in you, the hope of glory."" - Back cover.

The essays cover church modernism and modernity, renaissance and renewal, principles of church design, and a critique of modern iconoclasm. The appendices feature: a list of canonical documents pertaining to church architecture, a useful chart showing the comparative size of well known churches and comparative sizes of baldacchinos in Rome. Packed with informative essays and over 170 photographs, this collection will help priests, bishops, liturgical consultants, lay commissions and parishioners understand the Church s architectural tradition.

Mpho Tutu to the Epilogue by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this magnificent volume explores the birthplaces of the five great religions and follows them as they spread around the globe, defining the role of faith in human life and culture over the ages. Witness the births of Hinduism and Buddhism in India, and of the three great monotheistic religions-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-in the Middle East. Then trace their paths to the 21st century. A fascinating history of worship unfolds, beginning with simple rituals inspired by the early humans' awe of nature and evolving through millennia into sophisticated beliefs, rich scriptures, and elaborate traditions. Highlighted by 200 illustrations-unforgettable photographs, informative maps, and stunning examples of sacred art from all over the globe-every page of this elegant, eloquent book brings new understanding both of the unique roots of the world's great religions and of the universal principles they share, all the more timely in this era when our world is divided by conflict, often stemming from differences in faith. Here are the great figures-a creator god common to all, even the earliest tribal beliefs, and the teachers and prophets: Buddha, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad. Witness their teachings, along with the holy places where they flourished and the age-old observances that mark their traditions, from the Hindu ritual bathing in the Ganges before prayer to the Muslim hajj to Mecca, from the Jewish Passover seder to the Christian celebration of Christ's Resurrection. Here too are excerpts from each religion's texts, and evocative essays by eminent scholars on what their faith means to them and how it has shaped their view of life. In all, Geography of Religion reveals a vivid map of the paths we follow toward a higher truth. The Geography of Religion is an invitation to understand the great religions of the world. This gorgeously illustrated book is an authoritative text that portrays the great religions of humankind with vivid photographs, tracing each from its ancient roots to its role in modern life. Eminent scholars share the faiths they have lived and studied. For each of 5 major religions, explore the landscapes, areas, and cultures where these faiths took hold and flourished. See them spread around the world, survive conflict, and translate into other enduring faiths based on their geographic location and cultures. Learn what it means to be a Hindu and bathe in the sacred Ganges; for a Buddhist to revere a statue of the Enlightened One; for a Muslim to trek to Mecca; for Christian martyrs to welcome death. Beautiful maps, photographs, and art illuminate the history of each religion.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book is concerned with the role of religion and spirituality in individual identity and belief, as well as in the public spheres of governance and policy-making. It brings together significant researchers from various disciplinary perspectives, ranging from law and politics to theology, literature and media studies, with the aim of investigating new critical approaches to religion and spirituality, particularly in the postcolony/South. The authors engage seriously with the challenge of accounting for the range and power of religious and spiritual discourses that run through individual and communal identification. This volume provides stimulation for further thought and work in this crucial area of South African, and postcolonial, study and life""--Cover.

When leaders, whether in the church or in the marketplace, inspire their teams with a vision of what is possible, passion meets production and truly great things start to happen. As senior director of family ministries at Lakewood Church in Houston, Craig Johnson oversees thousands of staff members, lay leaders, and volunteers. From his unique vantage point comes Lead Vertically, a fresh look at the importance of building teams when the goal is not only success, but fulfillment. Lead Vertically includes tools and exercises that can be adapted by any leader for teams of any size, as well as tips for recruiting, training, and strengthening teams. Leaders will learn to inspire even when saying no and to build trust personally, not just professionally. People can live with disappointment but not without hope, and Lead Vertically shows leaders how to motivate teams by consistently and clearly communicating that the best days are ahead.

The Consistory and Social Discipline in Calvin's Geneva,Jeffrey Watt,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL23502367W,/authors/OL2734123A/Jeffrey_Watt,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  University of Rochester Press|Pages 336,"Created by John Calvin, the Consistory of Geneva was a quasi-tribunal entrusted with enforcing Reformed morality. Comprised of pastors and elders, this body met weekly and summoned people for a wide range of ""sinful"" behavior, such as drunkenness, dancing, blasphemy, or simply quarrels, and was a far more intrusive institution than the Catholic Inquisition. Among the thousands summoned during Calvin's ministry were a pair of women who were allegedly prophets, boys who skipped catechism to practice martial arts, and a good number of people begging for forgiveness for having renounced Protestantism out of fear of death.  This superbly researched book, reflecting author Jeffrey Watt's career-long involvement in the ongoing project of transcribing, editing, and publishing the Consistory records, is the first comprehensive examination of this morals court and provides a window into the reception of the Reformation in the so-called Protestant Rome. Watt examines the role of the Consistory in upholding patriarchy, showing that while Genevan authorities did not have a double standard in prosecuting illicit sexuality, the Consistory exhorted women to obey even violently abusive husbands. He finds also that Calvin and his colleagues vigorously promoted a strong work ethic by censuring people, mostly men, for laziness, and showed a surprising degree of skepticism toward accusations of witchcraft patterns. Finally, Watt demonstrates convincingly that, while the Consistory encountered some resistance, Genevans by and large shared the ideals it promoted and that it enjoyed considerable success in fostering discipline in Genevan society.  JEFFREY R. WATT is the Kelly Gene Cook Sr. Professor of History at the University of Mississippi.  This book will be made openly available in digital formats thanks to a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This book is concerned with the role of religion and spirituality in individual identity and belief, as well as in the public spheres of governance and policy-making. It brings together significant researchers from various disciplinary perspectives, ranging from law and politics to theology, literature and media studies, with the aim of investigating new critical approaches to religion and spirituality, particularly in the postcolony/South. The authors engage seriously with the challenge of accounting for the range and power of religious and spiritual discourses that run through individual and communal identification. This volume provides stimulation for further thought and work in this crucial area of South African, and postcolonial, study and life""--Cover.

They are embodied worldviews and practices lived out in the lives of our friends and colleagues. Encounters with these neighboring faiths often challenge our own beliefs and traditions. They make us think more deeply about our own faith commitments. For all who want to understand the religious faiths of their neighbors and co-workers, Winfried Corduan offers this helpful introduction to the religions of the world. His survey covers major and minor religions including Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, African traditional religion, Native American religion, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Baha'i, Chinese popular religion, and Shinto and Japanese religion. Neighboring Faiths emphasizes not just formal religious teachings but also how each religion is practiced in daily life. Dozens of photographs, charts and maps help illustrate how the faiths are lived out in contemporary culture. Moving beyond mere description, Corduan offers specific suggestions for how Christians can avoid giving unnecessary offense to followers of these faiths while engaging them in constructive dialogue. This edition has been thoroughly revised and expanded, with a new chapter on Islam after 9/11 and additional material throughout. For students seeking to understand what other religions believe and practice, and for small groups and churches who want to become more effective in reaching those from other cultures and religions, Neighboring Faiths is an indispensable guide. - Back cover.

This book is the outcome of an international collaboration between a wide range of researchers from different countries and fields of religious studies. The range and diversity of their contributions is the very strength of this book, for it shows how gendering works in studying different religious materials, whether foundational texts from the Bible or Koran philosophical ideas about truth, essentialism, history or symbolism, the impact of French feminist thinkers such as Irigaray or Kristeva, or again critical perspectives dealing with the impact of race, gender, and class on religion, or by deconstructing religious data from a postcolonial critical standpoint or examining the impact of imperialism and orientalism on religion and gender.""--Jacket.

Epigraphic and numismatic data indicate that this cult was dedicated in 89/90 to the Flavian imperial family. The architecture, sculpture, municipal titles and urban setting of the cult all reflect Asian religious traditions. The image of Ephesus was significantly altered by the use of these traditions in the institutions related to the cult of the Sebastoi. Within the context of the history of provincial cults in the Roman Empire, the cult of the Sebastoi became a turning point in the rhetoric of social order. Thus, the cult served as a prototypical manifestation of socio-religious developments during the late first and early second centuries in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Process thought asserts that process is funadamental to not only human experience, but to the structure of reality. Some of the categories of Whiteheads process metaphysics have been appropriated throughout the specific chapters in this book as a means of analyzing contemporary Buddhist-Christian dialogue and this dialogues encounter with the natural sciences. Accordingly, the Whiteheadian process of thought provides the foundations of understanding the process of Buddhist-Christian dialogue support within each chapter of this book.

Eerdmans Pub. Co.|Language English,"In this illuminating guidebook, film teacher and critic Roy Anker explores some of cinema's most profound depictions of human beings searching for meaning in life. The films he delves into -- The Thin Red Line, American Beauty, Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking, The Apostle, E.T., Magnolia, and twelve more -- are, with few exceptions, not overtly ""religious"" or ""Christian."" Yet from the world of secular Hollywood he succeeds in drawing together some of the most religiously provocative movies of our time. Providing synopses, commentary, background information, and both pre-viewing comments and post-viewing discussion questions for each film, Anker -- without being preachy or didactic -- offers movie buffs profound new insights. Watching this diverse collection anew through Anker's eyes, readers will find these films not only enjoyable but also deeply enlightening. - Publisher.

Psychology and religion within an ideological surround,Paul J.

The foundational argument of the ISM is that psychology as well as religion unavoidably operates within the limits of an ideological surround. Methodological theism, therefore, needs to supplement the methodological atheism that dominates the contemporary social sciences. Methodological theism should operationalize the meaningfulness of religious traditions and demonstrate empirically that the influences of ideology cannot be ignored. The ISM more generally suggests that contemporary social scientific rationalities need to be supplemented my more complex dialogical rationalities. Beliefs in secularization should also be supplemented by beliefs in trans-rationality.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

"Hearing Voices, Demonic and Divine",Christopher C.H. Cook,religion,,/works/OL20927068W,/authors/OL8010551A/Christopher_C.H._Cook,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English,"The Open Access version of this book, available at www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781472453983, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivative 4.0 license.        Experiences of hearing the voice of God (or angels, demons, or other spiritual beings) have generally been understood either as religious experiences or else as a feature of mental illness. Some critics of traditional religious faith have dismissed the visions and voices attributed to biblical characters and saints as evidence of mental disorder. However, it is now known that many ordinary people, with no other evidence of mental disorder, also hear voices and that these voices not infrequently include spiritual or religious content. Psychological and interdisciplinary research has shed a revealing light on these experiences in recent years, so that we now know much more about the phenomenon of ""hearing voices"" than ever before.               The present work considers biblical, historical, and scientific accounts of spiritual and mystical experiences of voice hearing in the Christian tradition in order to explore how some voices may be understood theologically as revelatory. It is proposed that in the incarnation, Christian faith finds both an understanding of what it is to be fully human (a theological anthropology), and God?s perfect self-disclosure (revelation). Within such an understanding, revelatory voices represent a key point of interpersonal encounter between human beings and God.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

His lineage comprises many of the greatest Dzogchen teachers of the twentieth century. The Essential Jewel is among his most beautiful compositions, although it may not be his best known. The poem synthesizes Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen perspective in a compelling admonition to engage in religious practice aimed at self-perfection. The Essential Jewel is an extraordinary poetic work. Patrul Rinpoche's voice is urgent, personal, compelling, and expressed for the most part in direct earthy language, although it is also replete with precise, technical terminology. The Essential Jewel is also philosophically profound. It draws on ideas grounded in Madhyamaka philosophy and Buddhist ethical theory as well as ideas and practices central to the Dzogchen tradition. Patrul Rinpoche's genius lies in part in his unique ability to articulate a precise philosophical vision in an accessible poetic voice and to do this in the context in an urgent admonition to practice. This translation aims to present this poem in a way that reflects Patrul Rinpoche's poetic voice with sufficient precision to convey his philosophical ideas. It provides an introduction that should give the reader a foundation to read the poem as well as explanatory notes at points where the poem contains references or terminology that may not be accessible to the Western reader""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It nourishes me. I do not write about joy primarily because I always have it. I write about joy, Black joy, because I want to generate it, I want it to emerge, I want to participate in its constant unfolding.” But alongside joy, A admits to Moth, come loneliness, exclusion, and unfulfilled desire.  The Lonely Letters is an epistolary blackqueer critique of the normative world in which Ashon T. Crawley—writing as A—meditates on the interrelation of blackqueer life, sounds of the Black church, theology, mysticism, and love. Throughout his letters, A explores blackness and queerness in the musical and embodied experience of Blackpentecostal spaces and the potential for platonic and erotic connection in a world that conspires against blackqueer life. Both a rigorous study and a performance, The Lonely Letters gestures toward understanding the capacity for what we study to work on us, to transform us, and to change how we inhabit the world.

"Hearing Voices, Demonic and Divine",Christopher C.H. Cook,religion,,/works/OL20927067W,/authors/OL8010550A/Christopher_C.H._Cook,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Language English,"The Open Access version of this book, available at www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781472453983, has been made available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivative 4.0 license.        Experiences of hearing the voice of God (or angels, demons, or other spiritual beings) have generally been understood either as religious experiences or else as a feature of mental illness. Some critics of traditional religious faith have dismissed the visions and voices attributed to biblical characters and saints as evidence of mental disorder. However, it is now known that many ordinary people, with no other evidence of mental disorder, also hear voices and that these voices not infrequently include spiritual or religious content. Psychological and interdisciplinary research has shed a revealing light on these experiences in recent years, so that we now know much more about the phenomenon of ""hearing voices"" than ever before.               The present work considers biblical, historical, and scientific accounts of spiritual and mystical experiences of voice hearing in the Christian tradition in order to explore how some voices may be understood theologically as revelatory. It is proposed that in the incarnation, Christian faith finds both an understanding of what it is to be fully human (a theological anthropology), and God?s perfect self-disclosure (revelation). Within such an understanding, revelatory voices represent a key point of interpersonal encounter between human beings and God.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It includes contributions representing a wide range of traditions: Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Taoism, Buddhism, and African and Native American religions. This book acknowledges the patriarchal overload of these traditions and institutes a creative search for the helpful, but neglected, resources of the traditions themselves. The contributors show how these resources support the economic and political empowerment of women and assist a rethinking of gender relations in terms of genuine mutuality. In addition they share information on their own lives and those of the women in their families that illuminate the discussion."" ""The book builds upon the enormous international feminist literature that has indicted the religions of the world for their insensitivity to women and their sacralization of sexism. It then looks into the causes of the fear that underlies much sexism and studies the distortion of religious symbols that supports sexism and masks men's obligations.""--Jacket.

White, Seventh-day Adventist prophetess, ranks with the Mormon Joseph Smith, the Christian Scientist Mary Baker Eddy, and Charles Taze Russell of the Jehovah's Witnesses as one of four 19th-century founders of a major American religious sect. Yet, outside her own church of 2.5 million members, she is probably the least known. Her comparatively unsensational life and her church's reticence to expose her private papers to the scrutiny of critical scholars have contributed to this undeserved obscurity. By her death in 1915 she had founded one of the nation's largest indigenous denominations, created a string of sanitariums and hospitals stretching from Scandinavia to the South Pacific, and inspired an educational system without peer in the Protestant world today. She had traveled widely, lectured extensively, and written dozens of books on a variety of subjects. Few contemporaries, male or female, accomplished more. - Preface.

"Books, Broadcasts, and the War, 1931-1949",C. S.

S. Lewis was a prolific letter writer, and his personal correspondence reveals much of his private life, reflections, friendships, and the progress of his thought. This second of a three-volume collection contains the letters Lewis wrote after his conversion to Christianity, as he began a lifetime of serious writing. Lewis corresponded with many of the twentieth century's major literary figures, including J. R. R. Tolkien and Dorothy Sayers. Here we encounter a surge of letters in response to a new audience of laypeople who wrote to him after the great success of his BBC radio broadcasts during World War II -- talks that would ultimately become his masterwork, Mere Christianity. Volume II begins with C. S. Lewis writing his first major work of literary history, The Allegory of Love, which established him as a scholar with imaginative power. These letters trace his creative journey and recount his new circle of friends, ""The Inklings,"" who meet regularly to share their writing. Tolkien reads aloud chapters of his unfinished The Lord of the Rings, while Lewis shares portions of his first novel, Out of the Silent Planet. Lewis's weekly letters to his brother, Warnie, away serving in the army during World War II, lead him to begin writing his first spiritual work, The Problem of Pain. After the serialization of The Screwtape Letters, the director of religious broadcasting at the BBC approached Lewis and the ""Mere Christianity"" talks were born. With his new broadcasting career, Lewis was inundated with letters from all over the world. His faithful, thoughtful responses to numerous questions reveal the clarity and wisdom of his theological and intellectual beliefs. Volume II includes Lewis's correspondence with great writers such as Owen Barfield, Arthur C. Clarke, Sheldon Vanauken, and Dom Bede Griffiths. The letters address many of Lewis's interests -- theology, literary criticism, poetry, fantasy, and children's stories -- as well as reveal his relation ships with close friends and family. But what is apparent throughout this volume is how this quiet bachelor professor in England touched the lives of many through an amazing discipline of personal correspondence. Walter Hooper's insightful notes and compre hensive biographical appendix of the correspon dents make this an irreplaceable reference for those curious about the life and work of one of the most creative minds of the modern era.

In the midst of indescribable loss, and without a job, a home, or an education, Eric was determined to start a new life for himself and his two surviving brothers.My Father, Maker of the Trees is the story not only of his physical survival, it is the story of his spiritual rebirth and the role he is playing in the healing and redemption of his land and people. His incredible account will show readers the reality of evil in the world as well as the power of hope. Eric's message of God's relentless love through our darkest circumstances will encourage and inspire.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Evangelical vs. Liberal,James K.

Liberals and evangelicals clash in bitter competition for the future of their respective subcultures. In this book, James Wellman examines this conflict as it is played out in the American Northwest. Drawing on an in-depth study of twenty-four of the area's fastest-growing evangelical churches and ten vital liberal Protestant congregations, Wellman captures the leading trends of each group and their interaction with the wider American culture. He finds a remarkable depth of disagreement between the two groups on almost every front. Where evangelicals are willing to draw sharp lines on gay marriage and abortion, liberals complain about evangelical self-righteousness and disregard for personal freedoms. Liberals prefer the moral power of inclusiveness, while evangelicals frame their moral stances as part of a metaphysical struggle between good and evil. The entrepreneurial nature of evangelicalism translates into support of laissez-faire capitalism and democratic political advocacy. Liberals view both policies with varying degrees of apprehension. Such differences are significant on a national scale, with implications for the future of American Protestantism in particular and American culture in general. Both groups act in good faith and with good intentions, and each maintains a moral core that furthers its own identity, ideology, ritual, mission, and politics. In some situations, they share similar attitudes despite having different beliefs. Attending church services and interviewing senior pastors, lay leaders and new members, Wellman is able to provide new insights into the convenient categories of ""liberal"" and ""evangelical,"" the nature of the conflict, and the myriad ways both groups affect and are affected by American culture. - Publisher.

Majorities of American Christians support reproductive justice and LGBTQ+ rights. Yet they're erased from our public narrative--only mentioned as outliers to the fundamentalist norm.  In Just Faith, progressive Christian activist and writer Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons explains how a strong religious left has accompanied every major progressive advance in our society, and he resurrects the long but forgotten history of progressive Christianity in the United States that can and must link arms with progressive Muslims and Jews to make the moral case for pluralism, human dignity, and the common good.   Graves-Fitzsimmons provides a blueprint for this type of resurrection based on his advocacy work at the intersection of religion and American politics. Graves-Fitzsimmons creates a rallying cry for a bold progressive Christianity that unapologetically fights for its values to impact the biggest political battles of our time--from immigration and economic fairness to LGBTQ+ rights and abortion rights--so that progressive Christians will stop lowering their voices when they identify as Christians. What kind of Christian are you? they'll be asked. And they'll even be understood when they reply with a smile, The good kind.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

During these years, Waugh became enthusiastic about American Catholicism, in particular, monasticism as seen through the eyes of the author of The Seven Storey Mountain. He agreed to edit Merton's autobiography and the subsequent Waters of Siloe, for publication in Britain. In this close examination of their friendship, through their correspondence, we see Waugh's coaching of a younger writer, and Waugh's brief infatuation with America. Most of all, we witness Merton the writing student and spiritual master and Waugh the master of prose and conflicted penitent. And we see how the two men diverge as the Second Vatican Council takes hold of Catholicism and the solid spiritual ground beneath them gives way""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A history of religion in 5 1/2 objects,S.

We need things: objects, keepsakes, knickknacks, bits and pieces, junk and treasure. As Brent Plate argues in A History of Religion in 5 1/2 Objects, exploring the stuff of everyday existence is a fresh window into the way humans have formed religious communities, performed rituals, and connected with the realm of the sacred. Beginning with the human desire to connect (evoked by ""1/2""), Plate tells the stories of five types of ordinary objects that people have engaged with in sensory, symbolic, and sacred ways: stones, crosses, incense, drums, and bread. These material objects, each of which strongly engages one of our five senses, have been used in religious ceremonies throughout human history and across the world. A History of Religion in 5 1/2 Objects shows us that basic, material connections stand at the heart of religious traditions, as humans quest for meaningful, fulfilling lives. As Plate looks at each of these objects, he traces the history of the world's religions and finds remarkable similarities and recurring themes throughout the millenia. We learn why incense is used by Hindus at a celebration of the goddess Durga in Banaras, by Muslims at a wedding ceremony in West Africa, and by Roman Catholics at a mass in upstate New York. And why stones, in the form of cairns, grave markers, and monuments, became connected with places of memory across the world. A History of Religion in 5 1/2 Objects moves our understanding of religion away from the current obsessions with God, fundamentalism, and science. Religion, Plate shows, has more to do with our bodies than with our beliefs""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

With many baseball stories to enthrall even the most ardent enthusiast, 42 Faith also digs deep into why Jackie was the man he was and what both drove him and challenged him after his retirement. From his early years before baseball, to his time with Branch Rickey and the Dodgers, to his failing health in his final years, we see a man of faith that few have recognized.  This book will add a whole new dimension to Robinson's already awe-inspiring legacy. Yes, Jackie and Branch are both still heroes long after their deaths.

The underlying differences between these two approaches can create tensions and even outright hostility that undermines the best intentions of those involved. In Beholden: Religion, Global Health, and Human Rights, Susan R. Holman--a scholar in both religion and the history of medicine--challenges this traditional polarization by telling stories designed to help shape a new perspective on global health, one that involves a multidisciplinary integration of religion and culture with human rights and social justice. The book's six chapters range broadly, describing pilgrimage texts in the Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions; the effect of ministry and public policy on nineteenth-century health care for the poor; the story of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it shaped economic, social, and cultural rights; a ""religious health assets"" approach based in Southern Africa; and the complex dynamics of gift exchange in the modern faith-based focus on charity, community, and the common good. Holman's study serves as an insightful guide for students and practitioners interested in improving and broadening the scope of global health initiatives, with an eye towards having the greatest impact possible.

But miracles? Rising from the dead? Some of the stories you hear about him sound like just that - stories. A reasonable person would never believe them, let alone the claim that he's the only way to God! But a reasonable person would also make sure that he or she understood the facts before jumping to conclusions. That's why Lee Strobel - an award-winning legal journalist with a knack for asking tough questions - decided to investigate Jesus for himself. An atheist, Strobel felt certain his findings would bring Christianity's claims about Jesus tumbling down like a house of cards. He was in for the surprise of his life. Join him as he retraces his journey from skepticism to faith. You'll consult expert testimony as you sift through the truths that history, science, psychiatry, literature, and religion reveal. Like Strobel, you'll be amazed at the evidence - how much there is, how strong it is, and what it says. The facts are in. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?""

Rationalities in history,D. L.

In a strikingly original reassessment of seminal Weberian ideas, d'Avray applies value rationality to the comparative history of religion and the philosophy of law. Integrating theories of rational choice, anthropological reflections on relativism, and the recent philosophy of rationality with Weber's conceptual framework, d'Avray seeks to disengage 'rationalisation' from its enduring association with Western 'modernity.' This mode of analysis is contextualised through the examples of Buddhism, Imperial China, and sixteenth-century Catholicism--in the latter case building upon unpublished archival research. This ambitious synthesis of social theory and comparative history will engage social scientists and historians from advanced undergraduate level upwards, stimulating interdisciplinary discourse, and making a significant contribution to the methodology of history. D'Avray explores the potential of this new Weberian analysis further in his companion volume, Medieval religious rationalities""--Provided by publisher.

Reading the Book of Isaiah,Randall Heskett,religion,First published in 2011,/works/OL15921250W,/authors/OL2794189A/Randall_Heskett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Palgrave Macmillan|Language English,"""Many scholars have approached both the origins of ancient city laments in some of the oldest Sumerian texts and how this ""genre"" found its way into the Tanakh/Old Testament. Randall Heskett goes a step further. He uses both historical criticism and a form-critical approach to analyze and assess Lamentation and Restoration of Destroyed Cities as oral traditions of ancient Israelite prophetic genres. He also shows how a later exilic/post-exilic redactional framework may have semantically transformed older prophetic genres about destruction and restoration to be reflexes of the events around 587 BCE""--  ""Many scholars have approached both the origins of ancient city laments in some of the oldest Sumerian texts and how this ""genre"" found its way into the Tanakh/Old Testament. However, no one has treated Lamentation and Restoration of Destroyed Cities form-critically as oral traditions of ancient Israelite prophetic genres. Neither have scholars shown how a later exilic/post-exilic redactional framework may have semantically transformed older prophetic genres about destruction and restoration to be reflexes of the events around 587 BCE. Since much of the greater book of Isaiah responds to the destruction of the cities of Judah and the capitol city of Jerusalem, the homecoming of the exiles, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, this monograph will treat the original oral levels of tradition history and later exilic/post-exilic redactional levels of ""Lamentation and Restoration of Destroyed Cities in the Scroll of Isaiah..."" Finally, the concluding chapter will address city laments within biblical theology and how they may inform such events as the destruction of our own twin towers on 9-11""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Explores the development of the three Abrahamic traditions, brilliantly showing the way in which they have struggled with similar issues over the centuries.  Shows how the approach of each tradition can be used comparatively by the other traditions to illuminate and develop their own thinking.  Written by a renowned writer in philosophical theology, widely acclaimed for his comparative thinking on Jewish and Islamic theology.  A very timely book which moves forward the discussion at a period of intense inter-religious dialogue""--  ""Religious debate among Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scholars has acquired urgent new dimensions in recent years. Yet over the course of 1400 years, what have the Abrahamic traditions really learned from each other? Brilliantly demonstrating the ways that Christianity, Islam, and the Judaism have struggled with similarly intractable issues over the centuries, Towards a Jewish-Christian-Muslim Theology offers insightful new pathways for productive theological work, along with deep insights into the topic of faith itself. Burrell uses exercises in 'creative hermeneutics' to show how each tradition struggles with complex issues, and how comparative inquiry illuminates those issues to the benefit of each tradition. For each key topic explored, renowned religious scholar and theologian David B. Burrell shows how intellectual trends of their day may be read to extend the reach of each tradition itself. By illuminating the actual and potential interaction among the dominant monotheistic religions, Towards a Jewish-Christian-Muslim Theology offers inspiration for continued theological dialogue and hope for people of all faiths in the 21st century""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

However, these images are sadly incomplete, because they ignore an equally important and more challenging aspect of his life -- his unwavering commitment to seeking peace. In The Saint and the Sultan, Paul Moses recovers Francis' s message of peace through the largely forgotten story of his daring mission to end the crusades.In 1219, as the Fifth Crusade was being fought, Francis crossed enemy lines to gain an audience with Malik al-Kamil, the Sultan of Egypt. The two talked of war and peace and faith and when Francis returned home, he proposed that his Order of the Friars Minor live peaceably among the followers of Islam--a revolutionary call at a moment when Christendom pinned its hopes for converting Muslims on the battlefield. The Saint and the Sultan captures the lives of St. Francis and Sultan al-Kamil and illuminates the political intrigue and religious fervor of their time. In the process, it reveals a startlingly timely story of interfaith conflict, war, and the search for peace. More than simply a dramatic adventure, though it does not lack for colorful saints and sinners, loyalty and betrayal, and thrilling Crusade narrative, The Saint and the Sultan brings to life an episode of deep relevance for all who seek to find peace between the West and the Islamic world.From the Hardcover edition.

However, it wasn't until he was a young missionary in the Philippines that he truly began to understand the Church's traditions, mysteries, and religious beliefs and its hold on those who follow the tradition. As he explains, Catholic spirituality is all about responding to the fundamental mystery of Jesus, the incarnation, and what it all meant in the beginning as well as what it means today.    In Almost Catholic, Sweeney offers an appreciation of Catholicism, weaving in the story of his own explorations with those of others who have also been attracted to this tradition. He finds himself drawn to the Church's ancient and medieval traditions out of a desire to connect with the deepest and widest paths on the way.

I asked her what she meant, and she explained that a God Story was a miracle-like experience that proves God exists. . . . I did have stories. I hadn't dared to tell many people about them, but I definitely had had what I believed to be encounters with the Divine. I wondered if many other people had stories too. What happened next surprised me most. I realized that a Divine intelligence that many people call God is connecting with millions of people every day. These are their stories."" --from the IntroductionIn God Stories, Jennifer Skiff shares the extraordinary experiences of people who have felt the power of God's presence in their lives and been forever changed. A doctor opens the chest of a dying heart patient to discover her heart is healed; Marines watch as a fellow soldier in Iraq is hit by a powerful explosion only to discover, when the dust settles, that he is still standing and has no injuries; a struggling couple receive an answer to a prayer and are prevented from making a mistake that could cost them their children; a young woman loses her boyfriend on 9/11 and receives a message that brings her peace.Reassuring, hopeful, and unforgettable, these amazing confirmations of divine intervention will lift your spirit and leave you wondering--and even remembering--when your life was touched by a miracle.From the Hardcover edition.

Lisa Miller raises debates and discussions not just about our visions of the afterlife, but about how our beliefs have influenced the societies we have built and the lifestyles to which we have subscribed, exploring the roots of our beliefs in heaven and how these have evolved throughout the ages to offer comfort and hope.She also reveals how the notion of heaven has been used for manipulation—to promulgate goodness and evil—as inspiration for selfless behavior, and as justification for mass murder.As Miller demonstrates in this absorbing and enlightening book, the desire for a celestial afterlife is universal—shared by the faithful around the world and across religions. It is as old as the Bible itself. While there are many notions of what exactly heaven is and how we get there, Jews, Christians, and Muslims all agree that heaven is God's home. From the Revelation to the Left Behind series, Augustine to Osama bin Laden, Muslims in the West Bank to American Mormons baptizing their dead, Heaven is a penetrating look at one of our most cherished religious ideals.

Whether this Reality was referred to as God, Brahman, Allah, Wakan Tanka, Shunyamurti, Tao, or by some other name, every branch of human society has, without doubt, seen traces of the One in the many wonders of nature.  Deserts, forests, mountains and oceans are all places where the eye of the heart has opened and we have caught a glimpse of the beauty and majesty of the Divine.  Immersed in the silence of the great forest cathedrals or listening to the pure song of a mountain stream, we have come to know the inner man who has always lived upon the threshold of Heaven.This collection of essays on the relationship between nature and the sacred reflects the thought of some of the most important religious authorities and scholars from Buddhist, Christian, Islamic, Jewish and Native American traditions.  Covering subjects ranging from flower viewing in Japan to the spiritual dimension of the environmental crisis, some of these articles are simple and poetic meditations while others are richly layered metaphysical studies concerning the divine root of creation.  Following each essay is a short poem, echoing the underlying theme of the book, and which is drawn from various traditions of spiritual poetry.The most important and urgent message of this anthology is that our current environmental crisis results from a loss of our spiritual center and that the physical world cannot be separated from the metaphysical without suffering potentially disastrous consequences.  Its fundamental thesis is that our continuing physical and spiritual well being is ultimately linked with our ability to “see God everywhere” and to “remember Him in all things.”  Whether this view is theistic, according to Western and Native American traditions, or non-theistic, according to the Buddhist perspective, all of the essays in this collection underline our need to recognize and embrace the interdependence of all things in the unity of the Real and to extend our definition of the spiritual into the ecological.  This vision of the immanence of God in nature is the most radical of all ecological perspectives because it points to the Origin of all that is.

Joyce Meyer says that keeping score of all the hurts we have suffered does more spiritual damage to us than those who have offended us. In fact, we can suffer serious physical illnesses as a result of unforgiveness. Is it difficult to forgive? Absolutely, but the rewards are well worth it.In THE POWER OF FORGIVENESS, Joyce Meyer reveals that when we choose to forgive others, we release ourselves from sin¿s power. The act of forgiving them allows God to work his will and our healing in the situation. Forgiveness in the power that will change life of defeat into one of victory.
