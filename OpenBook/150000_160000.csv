High-quality chocolate, strong coffee, and a big mug -- basic tools of the trade for Mocha, the sophisticated follow-up to Michael Turback's best-selling Hot Chocolate. Presented in a compact yet luxurious collection, Mocha offers nearly sixty recipes featuring the companionable ingredients of chocolate and coffee. Ranging from cozy cocoa concoctions to caffeinated couture combinations, recipes include hot drinks (the Triple Chocolate Maple Passion hails from Toronto, where they know how to heat things up); cold, refreshing classics (the Black-and-White Espresso Milkshake is almost a meal); creative cocktails (Chocolate-Espresso Martini, anyone?); and outrageous desserts (the Mocha-Java Cheesecake is the richest and smoothest cheesecake ever). Recipe contributors include notable chocolatiers, popular coffee purveyors, preeminent restaurant chefs, and a competitive cadre of coffeehouse baristas. - Back cover.

Here are classic recipes, including how to make a pot-au-feu, eight essential composed salads, pâté en croûte, blanquette de veau, choucroute, and the best ratatouille. Profiles of French food icons like Colette and Curnonsky, Brillat-Savarin and Bocuse, the Troigros dynasty and Victor Hugo.

Like n'duja, Mazzei has come to prominence in the last few years impressing fellow chefs, bloggers and critics alike. From making ice cream at his uncle's gelateria at the age of nine to working at London's prestigious Dorchester Hotel and on the pastry sections at Hakkasan and Yautcha, Mazzei has led a varied career that has straddled Rome, Edinburgh, London, Bangkok (where he opened an Italian restaurant at the Royal Sporting Club) and Calabria. He opened L'Anima in 2008, which became one of the leading lights of London's collection of Italian restaurants. Signature dishes at L'Anima - such as Charcoal scallops with n'duja and salsa verde and Spit roast leg of lamb with cannellini beans and black cabbage - offer prime examples of a style that marries rustic Calabrian flavours with Modern European precision. His next project opens in Autumn 2015 with the relaunch of Sartoria in Mayfair. This, his first book, is a straightforward '80 terrific southern Italian recipes' with an introduction to the food of Southern Italy.

Helene An, executive chef and matriarch of the House of An, is hailed as the ""mother of fusion"" and was inducted into the Smithsonian Institute for her signature style that brings together Vietnamese, French, and California- fresh influences. Now her daughter Jacqueline tells the family story and shares her mother's delicious and previously ""secret"" recipes, including ""Mama's"" Beef Pho, Drunken Crab, and Oven-Roasted Lemongrass Chicken.

The result is a fascinating peek at a lost world, and the evolution of an extraordinary cuisine.

But why are we still a nation that thinks it's a bit racy to slice a banana onto our cornflakes in the morning? A 'piece of fruit' in a lunch box, on the breakfast table or at the end of a meal is all very well, but fruit is so much more exciting than this, and we don't eat nearly enough of the stuff. Perhaps this is because we don't always understand how to use it in our cooking, or how to choose the best fruit for the season. Hugh sets out to address this head on. With 180 delicious recipes, River Cottage Fruit Every Day! will show you how to enjoy a broader eating experience and make fruit easy, fun and irresistible. You'll find recipes for all the wonderful seasonal fruit that grows in this country, and learn how to make the most of fruit from other parts of the world. Recipes include marinated lamb and fig kebabs; barbecued pork chops with peaches and sage; venison stew with damsons; and parsnip and apple cakes. There are also fresh and zingy salads as well as gorgeous cakes, tarts, pies, crumbles and puddings. With glorious photography from Simon Wheeler, this book will bring amazing new fruity vitality and flavour to your food.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|1 Currently reading|0 Have read

"A Single Parent's ""Guerilla Tactics"" Cookbook",Lillian Owl,cooking,First published in 2003,/works/OL15191423W,/authors/OL3889507A/Lillian_Owl,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24323693M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2003|Publisher  SynergEbooks|Language English,"Chapter One begins with the newly single parent, giving suggestions on weathering the first steps of the transition, with an emphasis on the traumas of dividing up property and figuring out what to keep in a suddenly smaller kitchen; how to economize on purchases, including using coupons, avoiding expensive and unhealthy junk food, and making the kids still feel loved at meal times. Chapter Two tackles a tough subject for some children: vegetables. More ideas about saving money on food purchases, mainly by avoiding wastage (frozen vs. fresh);  also, making the veggies taste good and look interesting to the kids. Chapter Three is titled ""Everything You [N]Ever Wanted to Know About Pasta,"" which contains all the author's wit and wisdom about cooking macaroni and pasta in ways that children will not get bored with it; includes substituting rice for variety or food sensitivities. Chapter Four talks about how to use eggs, especially at times when there is nothing else in the house worth eating. The emphasis is on omelets, which can be stuffed with everything from vegetables to leftover meats or casseroles, and scrambled eggs that no one will complain about for dinner. Chapter Five is all about chicken, which is often the only fresh meat that a struggling family ever eats. The chapter details both how to cook chicken from scratch and how to use leftovers in ways that will please the children and nurture their bodies as well, including cooking extra chicken ahead of time and using it as sandwich meat or protein for salads. Chapter Six is a peon to the versatility of hamburger meat (into which can be hidden vegetables), in everything from stews like chili con carne all the way to basic meatloaf.  Included is a fun meal of kid-friendly tacos, good for times when the single parent has to host a party or other gathering. Chapter Seven:  Salad as a MealWhole Dinner SaladChapter Eight details the joys of potatoes, from basic baked to boiled, and even a few more exotic dishes from the British Isles.  Chapter Nine eases the nervous novice cook's mind about roasting meats, with very simple methods for roasting the occasional pork roast or pot roast. Chapter Ten is more about snacking and lunches, because it deals with sandwiches for all occasions. Helps the parent to keep the child from being bored with the same old sandwiches by providing many creative but simple variations on the basics. Chapter Eleven is what we've all been dreaming of,  desserts.  Many of these recipes are sneaky ways to get your child to eat fruit, by blending it into pudding , vanilla yogurt, or  even ice cream. Chapter Eleven contains some stories behind a few of the recipes, sort of slices of the life of the author. Appendix ""A"" contains  cooking terms and notes on kitchen stuff, things which may not be obvious to the inexperienced cook (or the suddenly single dad). Appendix ""B"" is all about microwaves, demystifying the basic means of cooking food with these appliances, without ruining the food. The last section of the book is the Bibliography and Recommended Reading, where I highly praise and thank all my ""teachers"" who helped the author learn to cook by her bootstraps. Witty Blurb: ""This book has everything AND the kitchen sink."" (Gee, I hope someone says that besides me!)   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We like the idea of cooking with the seasons and we want our children to learn that cooking good food from raw ingredients is fun and easy, as well as a worthwhile and healthful thing to do. This book takes the ingredients that we bring home from the market and shows ways to use them, from the breakfast special muesli to the lunchtime omelette, from the homemade salad dressing to the afternoon cookie, from the dinnertime chicken casserole to the seasonal fruit dessert. A selection of recipes have been chosen as especially suitable for small children to make, or help to make. Also included are feature panels on growing your own produce, whether it be a simple herb pot on the windowsill or a backyard vegie patch. Buying wisely and cooking well are truly an investment for life.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

From her earliest memory, her mother and grandmother passed down the mystery of baking and the importance of this deceptively simple food. And now, as the owner of Wild Rise bake house, Liesl spends every day up to her elbows in dough, nourishing and perfecting her craft.  But the simple life she has cultivated is becoming quite complicated. Her head baker brings his troubled grandson into the bakeshop as an apprentice. Her waitress submits Liesl's recipes to a popular cable cooking show. And the man who delivers her flour, a single father with strange culinary habits, seems determined to win Liesl's affection.  When Wild Rise is featured on television, her quiet existence appears a thing of the past. And then a phone call from a woman claiming to be her half-sister forces Liesl to confront long-hidden secrets in her family's past. With her precious heritage crumbling around her, the baker must make a choice: allow herself to be buried in detachment and remorse, or take a leap of faith into a new life.

You'll learn to plant an indoor herb garden, make herb breads and jellies, grow and use everlastings, create pomanders and herbal pet aids, and much more.  Each chaper presents a potpourri of projects appropriate to a different month. In February, for example, you plan your spring gardens -- a perennial fragrance bed, an all-purple garden, and all-thyme garden, a knot garden. Meanwhile you luxuriate in a lavender bath and sip a hot tisane (herbal tea) -- or perhaps concoct an herbal valentine. November, on the other hand, features recipes for poultry stuffings, directions for making gift baskets, potpourris, and Thanksgiving condiments, and instructions on bedding down the garden for the winter.  An extensive ""Gourmet Gardening"" section begins each chapter, with advice on seed-starting, soil preparation, companion planting, organic pest control, harvesting, and garden wrap-up.  The book also includes:   A culinary ""herb-of-the-month""   A chart of botanical names and families   Harvesting and preserving tips   Shaudys's previous work, Growing Fragrant Herbs for Profit, with advice on how to package, display, price, and promote herbs   A brief encyclopedia of herbs   A list of herb suppliers   A bibliography   A chart of herb uses     Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Flavors of Empire examines the rise of Thai food and the way it shaped the racial and ethnic contours of Thai American identity and community. Full of vivid oral histories, this book explores the factors that made foodways central to the Thai American experience. Starting with American Cold War intervention in Thailand, Mark Padoongpatt traces how informal empire allowed U.S. citizens to discover Thai cuisine abroad and introduce it inside the United States. When Thais arrived in Los Angeles, they reinvented and repackaged Thai food in various ways to meet the rising popularity of the cuisine in urban and suburban spaces. Padoongpatt opens up the history, politics, and tastes of Thai food for the first time, all while demonstrating how race emerges in seemingly mundane and unexpected places""--Provided by publisher.

Every meal can be customized according to peak produce and taste preferences, making them all relevant and fresh all the time. Here, too, are an abundance of back-pocket recipes from spice rubs to sauces to infusions. Plated's approach to both prep and cooking makes using fresh, seasonal ingredients at home a snap.

Brule deliciously demystifies meat substitutes and flavors up familiar vegetables. Imagine vegetarian barbecue: Brule's recipe for spicing, saucing, and oven-roasting jackfruit offers a robustly tasty alternative to pulled pork. Tofu is the perfect base for crispy Southern Fried Buttermilk Nuggets, and cauliflower beautifully fills in for shrimp in a Cajun-inspired etouffee. Brule also highlights just how many traditional southern dishes are in fact vegetarian, and they're gathered together for you in this gorgeously illustrated book. Beloved foods like tomato pie, pimento cheese, grits casserole, and more will encourage you to skip the meat without a second thought.

For a long time, brassicas had a mixed reputation. While a small group of people staunchly adored them, most Americans were not as fond of the vegetables formerly known as ""cruciferous"" (who doesn't remember a plate of stinky boiled cabbage or President Bush's condemnation of broccoli?). But in recent years, a transformation has occurred. Kale has taken the world by storm and there's hardly a restaurant left that doesn't have Brussels sprouts on the menu. The rising popularity of brassicas is not only due to their extraordinary health benefits and ""superfood"" status, but also the realization that they can taste delicious when properly prepared. Brassicas shows home cooks how to bring out the flavors of these vegetables without death-by-boiling or burial under a blanket of cheese. When roasted, brassicas reveal an inherent sweetness. In a fresh salad or saute, they add a delightful peppery punch. Celebrating natural flavors rather than masking them, Brassicas both inspires cooks as well as arms them with appetizing new ways to increase their vegetable consumption""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

While this book does not claim that garlic saved civilization (though it might cure whatever ails you), it does take us on a grand tour of garlic's fascinating role in history, medicine, literature, and art; its controversial role in bigotry, mythology, and superstition; and its indispensable contribution to the great cuisines of the world. But just to make sure the appetite doesn't feel slighted, over 75 recipes that feature garlic are included too, from Italy's Pasta Aglio Olio to China's Good Fortune Garlic Lettuce. Garlic is a compelling story about an elemental, earthy, and rustic food with truly deep roots""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The magazine's experts expounded on the best and latest ways to decorate home, tree, and parcels and to create homemade gifts for family and friends, as well as games to be played to capture the spirit of the season. In short, The Farmer's Wife presented its own opinion--both grand and humble, broad and minute, and always, always bearing in mind the idea of community among its readers--about the ways in which Christmas should be celebrated. You'll find in this book a smattering of that opinion. Here are recipes to see you through the entire Christmas season; gift ideas guaranteed to get your creative juices flowing; tips for decking your halls; and even a few stories to delight both the young and the young at heart""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Readers will also enjoy reviewing the utensils' and appliances' original patent blueprints, as well as photos of the ""guts"" of these culinary tools. The author even includes odd side stories, such as how the waffle iron played a role in the founding of Nike, how you can reset a turkey timer, and why socialite Josephine Cochran really invented the dishwasher in 1886 -- it wasn't because she wanted to ease the burden of her servants, but because she wanted a device that would avoid the unsightly chips associated with hand washing. And finally, for those whose stovetop skills are still in development, Sobey provides information on the invention and use of the smoke detector and hand-held fire extinguisher. - Publisher.

The Vegetarian Option,Simon Hopkinson,cooking,First published in 2009,/works/OL15026123W?edition=ia%3Avegetarianoption0000hopk_n1y2,/authors/OL947452A/Simon_Hopkinson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24415841M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Quadrille Publishing|Pages 224,"All too often, the vegetarian option is an afterthought on a restaurant menu or the vegetables are relegated to a side dish at home. Here, for the first time, Simon Hopkinson focuses entirely on cooking mouth-watering recipes without meat or fish. Using fresh good-quality produce and combining appropriate ingredients in season are key to Simon Hopkinson's cooking. Invitingly, throughout the book, ingredients that go together are paired together: aubergine & pimento; tomatoes &  olives; pappardelle & porcini, peaches & plums, for example. Vegetables feature strongly, of course, but there are also plenty of original ideas and gorgeous recipes for herbs, pasta, rice, pulses, eggs and dairy, fruit - and cocktails! Simplicity, practicality and sensitivity are the essence of Simon's cooking, and his recipes are a joy to make. But there is so much more to appreciate in this highly original book as the author's evocative writing brings his food to life on every page. Superbly photographed by Jason Lowe, The Vegetarian Option is not written exclusively for vegetarians, but as a fresh source of inspiration for all genuine food lovers.

And it isn't easy to convince them that the effects of bad eating will tell when they reach the unimaginable age of forty! So, any approach to healthy eating for children must be logical and the food should be attractive and very tasty. ...     For young children it helps to give healthy food a novelty appeal. Wholemeal scones for instance may not raise squeals of delight, but scone moons, stars and pigs will go down a treat. A sandwich train will also make your children's eyes light up, and you can easily sneak a healthy filling inside. ""    [ From the Introduction ]    Carole Handslip is a trained home economist who has written several top-selling cookbooks. She has featured in television and radio healthy eating programmes, and is the author of High Fibre Cooking and Summer Desserts in this series.

Imagine a chocolate sheet cake with a creamy icing, made in minutes (and from scratch!) without much more work than flipping a switch. Imagine ice cream. Imagine gingerbread. Imagine the best buttermilk waffles ever. Now imagine one more thing: all of the baked treats are (shh--don't tell your family) whole-grain desserts because you grind your own flour right in the blender's canister before you add the other ingredients. These 140+ original, quick, and easy recipes for ice creams, puddings, cream pies, ice box cakes, layer cakes, brownies, muffins, scones, and even pancakes and waffles are a revolution. This is dessert-making unlike anything before. This is a whole new way to think about a turbo blender.

In his latest cookbook, Matt takes this a step further by showing us how versatile salads can be in both form and flavor. With the garden's yield as his inspiration, he pairs produce with grains, beans, cheeses, fish, and meat to create enticing, adaptable dishes. You'll find a recipe to match each season's bounty, from spring salads featuring early sprouting vegetables and herbs, and summer produce mixed with garden-fresh greens, to autumn roots tossed with hearty grains, and earthy winter noodle salads. In Mr. Wilkinson's Well-Dressed Salads, recipes include light dishes such as Watermelon and Feta with a Shrimp Vinaigrette, and Iceberg, Mint and Radish Salad with Avocado Dressing. There is also heartier fare, such as Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Hot Red Turkish Peppers & Labneh (a Turkish yogurt), Brown Rice & Feta with Hot 'n' Sour Dressing, and Smashed Figs, Blue Cheese, and Walnut Salad with White Balsamic.

For dessert, make a delectable mango tart filled with orange-blossom water, or liven up weekend breakfast with hot lemon fritters and cinnamon sugar. Greg and Lucy want people to become as comfortable with the ingredients, techniques, and dishes in Moorish as they are with more familiar foods.

Today there are over 40,000 Chinese restaurants across the United States--by far the most plentiful among all our ethnic eateries. Now, in Chop Suey Andrew Coe provides the authoritative history of the American infatuation with Chinese food, telling its fascinating story for the first time. It's a tale that moves from curiosity to disgust and then desire. From China, Coe's story travels to the American West, where Chinese immigrants drawn by the 1848 Gold Rush struggled against racism and culinary prejudice but still established restaurants and farms and imported an array of Asian ingredients. He traces the Chinese migration to the East Coast, highlighting that crucial moment when New York ""Bohemians"" discovered Chinese cuisine--and for better or worse, chop suey. Along the way, Coe shows how the peasant food of an obscure part of China came to dominate Chinese-American restaurants; unravels the truth of chop suey's origins; reveals why American Jews fell in love with egg rolls and chow mein; shows how President Nixon's 1972 trip to China opened our palates to a new range of cuisine; and explains why we still can't get dishes like those served in Beijing or Shanghai. The book also explores how American tastes have been shaped by our relationship with the outside world, and how we've relentlessly changed foreign foods to adapt to them our own deep-down conservative culinary preferences. Andrew Coe's Chop Suey: A Cultural History of Chinese Food in the United States is a fascinating tour of America's centuries-long appetite for Chinese food. Always illuminating, often exploding long-held culinary myths, this book opens a new window into defining what is American cuisine.

John Tadich immigrated to San Francisco in 1872 and started working at the then-called New World Coffee Saloon soon after, becoming sole owner in 1887. He sold the restaurant in 1928 to the Buich family, which has carried on the Tadich tradition ever since.

It deserves better. Part I of The HORIZON COOKBOOK AND ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF EATING AND DRINKING THROUGH THE AGES is a history of civilized man’s long culinary heritage. Woven into the historical narrative are hundreds of anecdotes and incidents that make intriguing reading and bear mealtime retelling. THE RECIPES: The more than 600 recipes in Part II are the largest collection of historical recipes ever assembled in a single volume. The collection gives every cook – from novice - to cordon bleu chef - a chance to create savory and unusual dishes from a wide range of periods and places. The recipes have been tested and adapted for use in modern home kitchens by a special staff headed by Tatiana McKenna, a leading food authority and Contributing Food Editor of Vogue magazine. Mimi Sheraton, the book’s Historical Foods Consultant, has helped the editors re-create 19 menus from great historic occasions. THE ILLUSTRATIONS: There are pictures on every page of the historical narrative, and ten picture portfolios. All told, the book contains some 570 illustrations, 110 in color. It is probably the largest collection ever brought together on the subject. BOOK JACKET   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

That is what Gordon Ramsay had when he started out as a chef, working 16-hour days, 6 days a week. When he was struggling to get his first restaurant in the black, he didn't think he'd be famous for a TV show about how to run profitable eateries, or that he'd be head of a business empire. But he is and he did. Here's how.In the beginning there was nothing.Not a sausage - penniless, broke, fucking nothing - and although, at a certain age, that didn’t matter hugely, there came a time when hand-me-downs, cast-offs and football boots of odd sizes all pointed to a problem that seemed to have afflicted me, my mum, my sisters, Ronnie and the whole lot of us. It was as though we had been dealt the ‘all-time dysfunctional’ poker hand.I wish I could say that, from this point on, the penny dropped and I decided to do something about it, but it wasn’t like that. It would take years before the lessons of life, business and money began to click into place - before, as they say, I had a pot to piss in.This is the story of how those lessons were learned.This is Gordon Ramsay at his raw, rugged best. PLAYING WITH FIRE is the amazing story of Gordon’s journey from sous-chef to superstar. In his no-holds-barred style, Gordon shares his passion for risk and adventure and his hard-won success secrets.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Puglian food is  deeply rooted in the traditions of this southern Italian region, its geography, and its history as the breadbasket of Italy and the largest producer of olive oil.   In this cookbook, beautifully illustrated with recipe and preparation photos as well as images from Puglia itself, first-time author Viktorija Todorovska (a Chicagoan who studied cooking at the famed Florentince culinary school Apicius) has created a memorable introduction to this unsung cuisine. Puglian cooking's two great benefits are of huge interest today: it's very simple, usually requiring little technique and basic prepartion, and it's incredibly healthful, as it's based largely on olive oil and fresh vegetables.   Puglian cooking as Todorovska present it here respects the integrity and quality of the ingredients, which should be as fresh high quality as possible. The recipes in this cookbook are simple, the ingredients easy to find, and the dishes bursting of flavor. These are healthful, easy to prepare dishes that should appeal to everyone""--  ""Recipes from the Puglian region of southern Italy, with photographs""--Provided by the publisher.

When AAR President Adele Chatfield-Taylor asked Alice Waters for help, Waters famously responded, ""That depends. What do you want, better food--or a revolution?"" Fatefully and without hesitation, Chatfield-Taylor replied, ""A revolution."" And a revolution was ignited. Seven years later, Verdure is the RSFP's fourth cookbook (following Biscotti, Zuppe, and Pasta). It is perhaps the ideal collaboration among the kitchen and the Academy garden, the artisan producers, and the organic farmers who provide the impeccable raw ingredients used in each dish. Its ninety-two recipes are arranged seasonally. The RSFP kitchen feeds a group, so frugality is a consideration: beans, grains, and greens take a starring role, and maximizing flavor is paramount.

Expecting common ground with locals as an Asian American, Furiya struggled with her ambition as a food writer in a nation where notions of race and gender are set in stone. During the six years she lived in Beijing and Shanghai, Furiya experienced a wide range of experiences—loneliness, isolation, friendship, and love—tied together by one common theme: food. Ultimately, Furiya surpassed these challenges and found inspiration from the courageous Chinese women who graced her life. The sensuous experience of preparing and eating authentic Chinese cuisine follows Furiya throughout her journey, and ultimately reveals the intimate, nurturing side of the Chinese culture and people.

A new American cuisine is forming. Animals never before considered or long since forgotten are emerging as delicacies. Parts that used to be for scrap are centerpieces. Ash and hay are fashionable ingredients, and you pay handsomely to breathe flavored air. Going out to a nice dinner now often precipitates a confrontation with a fundamental question: Is that food? Dana Goodyear's anticipated debut, Anything That Moves, is simultaneously a humorous adventure, a behind-the-scenes look at, and an attempt to understand the implications of the way we eat. This is a universe populated by insect-eaters and blood drinkers, avant-garde chefs who make food out of roadside leaves and wood, and others who serve endangered species and Schedule I drugs--a cast of characters, in other words, who flirt with danger, taboo, and disgust in pursuit of the sublime. Behind them is an intricate network of scavengers, dealers, and pitchmen responsible for introducing the rare and exotic into the marketplace. This is the fringe of the modern American meal, but to judge from history, it will not be long before it reaches the family table. Anything That Moves is a highly entertaining, revelatory look into the raucous, strange, fascinatingly complex world of contemporary American food culture, and the places where the extreme is bleeding into the mainstream""--   Read more Read less",3 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Veteran journalist and Italophile John Keahey points out the keen distinctions that the western cities maintain: in food, lifestyle, and the way its artists are paving new directions in art that differ mightily from the Renaissance-rich interior. Keahey interviews sculptors and their artigiani, craftsmen and women who toil in the marble studios, eating their lunch in workers' clubs and cafes. From beach locales such as Viareggio, to Livorno (which has Venetian-style canals), modern Orbetello and the seven islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, Keahey reveals beaches rich in European visitors and magnificent medieval villages that rarely see outsiders. The larger, better-known Tuscan coastal city Pisa can even surprise a curious visitor with places of solitude. Keahey's previous books on Italy have always received widespread and complimentary review coverage--garnering praise for the depth of his research and his comprehensive analysis. Travelers instantly flock to books about Tuscany, and this one promotes towns and villages that are often missed by tourists, letting readers in on these 'secret' destinations. For armchair travelers or vacation seekers, Hidden Tuscany puts a very human face on the region in Keahey's discussion of food, history and language.

A definitive, fresh and approachable collection of 150 traditional recipes from an authoritative voice on Middle Eastern home cooking, Salma Hage's new book is in line with the current Western trends of consciously reducing meat, and the ancient Middle Eastern culture of largely vegetarian, mezze style dining. Traditionally, the Middle Eastern diet consisted largely of vegetables, fruits, herbs, spices, pulses, grains and legumes. Salma simplifies this fast becoming popular cuisine with easily achievable recipes, many with vegan and gluten-free options. Drawing inspiration from ancient and prized Phoenician ingredients, from grassy olive oil to fresh figs and rich dates, this book offers an array of delicious breakfasts and drinks, mezze and salads, vegetables and pulses, grains and desserts. Salma shows how to easily make the most of familiar everyday fruits and legumes, as well as more exotic ingredients now widely available outside of the Middle East, with nourishing recipes so flavourful and satisfying they are suitable for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

Theo focuses on what he loves best - a few top quality ingredients making perfectly balanced flavour combination - and offers over 100 recipes with simple methods that work in a home kitchen. For Theo, food is a pleasure to be shared with friends and family and cooking should be relaxing, enjoyable. With this in mind, Theo's recipes take from just 15 minutes to make from scratch so you can pick a dish depending on the time you have, then spend more time eating, enjoying and sharing the food you've prepared. Chapters are split by meal times with an emphasis on simplicity, with big and small sharing plates and lots of one-pots on offer. There are speedy starters, mains and puddings but Theo shows you how to make Italian staples from scratch too. So, when you do have time and want to make your own pastry or bake your own pizza, you have the best recipes to hand. Fresh and innovative, Theo's approach means you can relax at mealtimes while enjoying delicious food every day of the week.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Culled from chef and cheesemonger Chester Hastings s 25 years of experience, these recipes take full advantage of the varied flavors of cheese in ways both traditional and innovative. A cheese book that focuses on recipes rather than acting as a buyers guide or primer, this substantive and personal exploration accompanied by 50 color photographs plus wine pairing tips from acclaimed sommelier Brian Kalliel is a comprehensive guide to the vast world of specialty cheeses""--  ""The Cheesemonger's Kitchen is a collection of delightful and accessible recipes culled from chef and cheesemonger Chester Hastings' 25 years of experience working with cheese, both inside the kitchen and behind the counter at Beverly Hills' beloved Joan's on Third. Covering the basics of how to select and purchase quality cheeses (including what to look for, how to taste, and what to do with leftovers), its purpose is to take cheese beyond the fondue pot and the cracker and into the kitchen, and create delicious meals using the many varieties of cheese now more widely available than ever before, in new, traditional, and exciting ways. It will also include a chapter on pairing wine and cheese, written by celebrated sommelier Brian Kalliel.

This gifted cook, TV contestant, and storyteller takes us into his frontier world with simple food anyone can do. A cowboy's day starts early and ends late. Kent offers labor-saving breakfasts like Egg Bowls with Smoked Cream Sauce. For lunch or dinner, there's 20-minute Green Pepper Frito Pie, hands-off, four-ingredient Sweet Heat Chopped Barbecue Sandwiches, or mild and smoky Roasted Bean-Stuffed Poblano Peppers. He even parts with his prized recipe for Bread Pudding with Whisky Cream Sauce. (The secret to its lightness? Hamburger buns.) Kent gets creative with ingredients on everyone's shelves, using lime soda to caramelize Sparkling Taters and balsamic vinegar to coax the sweetness out of Strawberry Pie. With stunning photos of the American West and Kent's lively tales and poetry, A Taste of Cowboy is a must-have for everyone who loves good, honest food and wants a glimpse of a vanishing way of life""--   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The book offers over 200 recipes in use at The Kirby House restaurant today, including their famous “Coconut Walnut Bread”, “Miss Ellie’s Carrot Cake” and “Celery Seed Dressing”.  Intermingled within the recipe text are tips providing educational information to the novice plus “A Special Touch” inserts, throughout this section, providing elegant and unique entertaining ideas.        Those interested in history can trace the building of the Kirby house from 1885 to present day, as well as take a glimpse at life and dining during the Victorian era. Readers will have a chance to meet the Thomas Kirby family and discover what brought them to Abilene; what influence they had on the Victorian community of Abilene, Kansas and how they were affected by the time in which they lived.        Other interesting tidbits include a menu from the historic “Drovers Cottage,” circa 1871, in addition to typical menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner during the Victorian era and, a chronology of some of the foods, food producers and advertising technique unique to that time period.

Sisters Danielle and Laura Kosann have always loved cooking and eating out. But for them, it was never just about the food. It also meant the outfits they wore to dinner, the decor of the restaurant, and the guest list at their dinner party. Actually, food permeated every aspect of their lives. With inherent interests in fashion, design, media, and celebrity, they realized nobody was ever looking at these categories through the lens of food. Why weren't people being asked about what they were eating the way they were being asked about their style, their careers, or their dating lives? In launching the website, Danielle and Laura not only got to talk about food all the time, but they also collected a trove of hilarious experiences in brushing elbows with celebrities from all walks of life. Now, their debut cookbook brings together those antics and anecdotes with 85 original recipes that anyone can make, as long as they're hungry and have a kitchen.""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read
