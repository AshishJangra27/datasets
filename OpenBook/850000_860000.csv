The following sixteen years saw politics and pop music come together as never before to challenge racism, gender inequality and social and class divisions. For the first time in UK history, musicians became instigators of social change and their political persuasion as important as the songs they sang. Through the voices of campaigners, musicians, artists and politicians, Daniel Rachel charts this extraordinary and pivotal period between 1976 and 1992, following the rise and fall of three key movements of the time: Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge, revealing how they both shaped, and were shaped by, the music of a generation. Consisting of new and exclusive in-depth conversations with over 100 contributors, including Pauline Black, Billy Bragg, Jerry Dammers, Phill Jupitus, Neil Kinnock, Linton Kwesi-Johnson, Tom Robinson, Clare Short, Tracey Thorn and many more, Walls Come Tumbling Downis a fascinating, polyphonic and authoritative account of those crucial sixteen years in Britain's history, from the acclaimed writer of Isle of Noises. Walls Come Tumbling Down also features more than 150 images - many rare or previously unpublished - from some of the greatest names in photography, including Adrian Boot, Chalkie Davies, Jill Furmanovsky, Syd Shelton, Pennie Smith, Steve Rapport and Virginia Turbett.""--Publisher description.

Well known for his compositions for keyboards and orchestra, Reger worked during the crucial decades when Western music transformed itself from the misty veil of Romanticism and Impressionism to the more hard-edged modernism that would prevail in the 20th century.  Less well known are his writings about music and the composer's craft.  Although he wrote a major book on music theory published in 1903 (and translated into English a year later), his extended essays on composition, his fellow composers, and analysis have never appeared before in English.  Christopher Anderson, a noted Reger scholar, has gone back to original manuscripts as well as the published versions of these writings to produce definitive new texts. Additionally, Anderson has written an opening essay placing Reger's writings and music in the context of his time.  This volume will appeal strongly to those interested in the Late Romantic era; musical composition and aesthetics; and of course those interested in the music and life of Reger.

Louder than bombs,Ed Vulliamy,music,First published in 2020,/works/OL20746834W,/authors/OL580988A/Ed_Vulliamy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Publisher  University of Chicago Press|Language English|Pages 497,"Part memoir, part reportage, Louder Than Bombs is a story of music from the front lines. Ed Vulliamy, a decorated war correspondent and journalist, offers a testimony of his lifelong passion for music. Vulliamy's reporting has taken him around the world to cover the Bosnian war, the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism, the Iraq wars of 1991 and 2003 onward, narco violence in Mexico, and more, places where he confronted stories of violence, suffering, and injustice. Through it all, Vulliamy has turned to music not only as a reprieve but also as a means to understand and express the complicated emotions that follow. Describing the artists, songs, and concerts that most influenced him, Vulliamy brings together the two largest threads of his life--music and war. Louder Than Bombs covers some of the most important musical milestones of the past fifty years, from Jimi Hendrix playing ""Machine Gun"" at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 to the Bataclan in Paris under siege in 2015. Vulliamy was present for many of these historic moments, and with him as our guide, we see them afresh, along the way meeting musicians like B. B. King, Graham Nash, Patti Smith, Daniel Barenboim, Gustavo Dudamel, and Bob Dylan. Vulliamy peppers the book with short vignettes--which he dubs 7"" singles--recounting some of his happiest memories from a lifetime with music. Whether he's working as an extra in the Vienna State Opera's production of Aida, buying blues records in Chicago, or drinking coffee with Joan Baez, music is never far from his mind. As Vulliamy discovers, when horror is unspeakable, when words seem to fail us, we can turn to music for expression and comfort, or for rage and pain. Poignant and sensitively told, Louder Than Bombs is an unforgettable record of a life bursting with music.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Schubert's dances,Martin Chusid,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL20547995W?edition=ia%3Aschubertsdancesf0000chus,/authors/OL1974151A/Martin_Chusid,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27791112M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2013|Language English|Pages 262,"Of the several genres comprising Schubert's prodigious compositional output, the one that has attracted the least attention from scholars has been his approximately 500 dances. Of these, more than 200 were published during his lifetime, twice as many as his songs; and they were received enthusiastically by the public. Yet, strangely enough, there has been only one slim volume devoted to the subject and it is in German, Schubert und das Tanzvergnügen (Schubert and the Enjoyment of the Dance). A translation of the opening section of that book forms the Introduction to our volume where it is entitled ""Dancing in Vienna in the Early 19th Century."" Although the composer's dances have been enjoyed in the United States and England by pianists and their pupils for generations, the current book is the first in English about them. Furthermore, there are relatively few articles or commentaries of substance that treat them seriously. Our publication begins with chapters on the minuets, all of which were written for members of his family, and his ecosaisses, primarily itended for his friends. Later another section is devoted to the polonaises and his other four hand dances, works that Schubert composed mainly for his only serious students, the Countesses Marie and Caroline Esterhazy. But by far the largest portion of the volume is devoted to the quick, triple-meter compositions Schubert labeled German dances or ländler, although his publishers most often gave them the title of Waltzes. The composer, however, used the term Walzer just once in his lifetime; and he did so in the course of a humorous poem to rhyme with the word Pfalzer, an inhabitant of the Rhine region of Germany, at the conclusion of a dance he in fact called a Deutscher (German dance). In the course of studying the dances a number of points insufficientally, or not at all, discussed in the Schubert literature has emerged. For one thing forty, approximatel 8% of these relatively short compositions--most are only 16 or 24 measures in length--begin and end in different keys. This is and aspect of Schubert's fremarkable harmonic imagination also visible in some 75 of his well over 600 songs. Another aspect of interest is that, despite their similarity in meter and tempo, there is a considerable diffence in musical character between the dances Schubert called German dances and those he labeled ländler. A third noteworthy feature of the composer's dances is the manner in which all of his later published dance sets, those which appeared from late 1825 to the end of his life in 1828 are organized tonally. They all begin and end in the same key. And, furthermore, they display close inner relationships as well. In contrast, of his earlier dance sets, those issued from 1821 to early 1825, a single group, the twelve waltzes of Op. 18 (D. 145), is rounded tonally in similar fashion. Finally, of the eminent composers influenced by Schubert, there are three who were particularly fascinated by his dances: Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, and Johannes Brahms. Their frequently expressed warm admiration for the composer, and especially their deep concern for his dances, are treated in the closing section of this volume, the Epilogue.

Yet few have addressed his contribution in the darkest hour of the civil rights movement. Telling the untold story of his historic Boston Garden concert of 1968, The Hardest Working Man also captures the magnificent achievements that made Brown a revolutionary icon of American popular culture.Acclaimed journalist James Sullivan begins his stirring account by depicting the racially charged climate of Boston in the hours after Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death. Brown's concert was slated for cancellation as police geared up for mass retaliation. After Brown butted heads with the mayor, the show was allowed to go on—and his emotional, electric performance was broadcast live on local television. Though rioting erupted in more than a hundred U.S. cities that night, Boston remained quiet. Not only bringing to life that transforming show, James Sullivan also charts Brown's incredible rise from poverty to self-made millionaire and the pivotal voice behind the signature anthem ""Say It Loud—I'm Black and I'm Proud,"" making The Hardest Working Man a tribute to an unforgettable concert and a rousing biography of a revolutionary musician.

L-vis is an imagined persona, a representation of artists who have used and misused Black music. Like so many others who gained fame and fortune from their sampling, L-vis is as much a sincere artist as he is a thief. In Kevin Coval's poems, L-vis' story is equal parts forgotten history, autobiography, and re-imaginings. We see shades of Elvis Presley, the Beastie Boys, and Eminem, and meet some of history's more obscure whiteboy heroes and anti-heroes: legendary breakdancers, political activists, and music impresarios.  A story of both artistic theft and radical invention, L-vis Lives! is a poetic novella on all of the possibilities and problems of post-racial"" American culture-where Black art is still at times only fully accepted in a white face, and every once in a while an L-vis"" comes along to step in to the void.  i am a hero to most. the great hope of something other. a complex back-story. something other than the business of my father.

Yet the influence of modern music can be felt everywhere. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalist music has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward. Music critic Alex Ross shines a bright light on this secret world, taking us from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, and riots. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music.--From publisher description.

Synthesizers demonstrate both the problem and its solution. The progression is from electronic organs to analogue synthesizers, from purely electronic oscillations to the addition, subtraction, multiplication, mixing, and performance of additional functions that comprise the complex sounds of music. The program also looks at digital sound and musique concrete, using the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to answer some of the questions about the partnership between science and music.""--Container.

The Fender stratocaster,Dave Hunter,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL23302310W,/authors/OL6781356A/Dave_Hunter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Voyageur Press|Language English|Pages 235,"""Fender's Stratocaster is arguably the number-one instrument icon of the guitar world. When introduced in 1954, its offset space-age lines, contoured body, and three-pickup configuration set the music world on its ear--it was truly unlike any guitar that had come before. In the hands of the world's most beloved players, the Stratocaster has since become a popular weapon of choice among rock, blues, jazz, and country players and, not coincidentally, is also one of the most copied electric guitars of all time. In this authoritatively written, painstakingly curated, and gloriously presented tribute to the 60-year-old Fender Stratocaster, author Dave Hunter covers the guitar's history from concept, design, and model launch through its numerous variations and right up to the present. The story is illustrated with archival images of Stratocasters and their players in action, studio shots of Stratocasters of varied vintage and provenance, memorabilia associated with famous players, and profiles of over 30 noted Strat slingers through the ages. Influential rock'n' rollers like Buddy Holly, Hank Marvin, Ike Turner, and Dick Dale; blues players like Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray, Bonnie Raitt, and John Mayer; metal gods Richie Blackmore, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Dave Murray; esteemed rockers Jeff Beck, David Gilmour, Ronnie Wood, Robbie Robertson, Rory Gallagher, Mark Knopfler, and Wayne Kramer; and post-punk heroes The Edge, John Frusciante, and Billy Corgan are all included. And so, of course, is Jimi Hendrix. With its unprecedented level of detail and stunning visuals, Fender Stratocaster is the only book tribute worthy of the world's greatest guitar.

Illustrations:  61 Black & White Photographs  Greatest hits from Chicago's essential guide to the global blues scene  This incomparable anthology collects articles, interviews, fiction, and poetry from the Original Chicago Blues Annual, one of music history's most significant periodical blues publications. Founded and operated from 1989 to 1995 by African American musician and entrepreneur Lincoln T. Beauchamp Jr., OCBA gave voice to the blues community and often frankly addressed contentious issues within the blues such as race, identity, prejudice, wealth, gender, and inequity.  OCBA often expressed an explicitly black perspective, but its contributors were a mix of black and white, American and international. Likewise, although OCBA's roots and main focus were in Chicago, Beauchamp's vision for the publication (and his own activities as a blues performer and promoter) embraced an international dimension, reflecting a broad diversity of blues audiences and activities in locations as farflung as Iceland, Poland, France, Italy, and South Africa.  BluesSpeak includes key selections from OCBA's seven issues and features candid interviews with Koko Taylor, Eddie Boyd, Famoudou Don Moye, Big Daddy Kinsey, Lester Bowie, Junior Wells, Billy Boy Arnold, Herb Kent, Barry Dolins, and many more. The volume collects work from literary artists such as Eugene B. Redmond, Quincy Troupe, Kalamu Ya Salaam, Julie Parson Nesbitt, and Hart Leroy Bibbs. Also featured are heartfelt memorials to bygone blues artists, insightful observations on the state of the blues in Chicago and beyond, and dozens of photographs of performers, promoters, and other participants in the worldwide blues scene.  ""An invaluable resource for the blues historian, and an entertaining read for the Chicago blues fan.""--About.com:Blues  ""Evoke[s] a raw and vivid portrait of the blues, its history and practitioners.""--AllAboutJazz  ""This collection strikes an excellent balance between interview, blues reportage, and literary work and will be of interest to blues fans, scholars of black literature, and anyone interested in community arts.""--Barry Lee Pearson, coauthor of Robert Johnson: Lost and Found  Lincoln T. Beauchamp Jr. is a Chicago-based musician, writer, publisher, record producer and promoter. Muddy Waters gave him the name ""Chicago Beau,"" and he has recorded and performed with some of the most respected names in music, including Memphis Slim, Archie Shepp, Pinetop Perkins, Fontella Bass, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, the African choir Amakhono We Sinto, and Frank Zappa.

So begins Stuart David's magical, evocative memoir about Belle and Sebastian. Determined to make his living writing stories and songs, Stuart had spent several years scraping by on the dole in his small, industrial home town. Then he had the fateful idea to learn bass guitar, and to head for Glasgow in search of like-minded artists. It was a quiet but powerful idea that would completely transform his life. Within one extraordinary year he had helped create one of the most influential, beloved bands of all time. Set against a vivid background of early 90s Glasgow, In the All-Night Cafe describes Stuart's fortuitous meeting with the band's co-founder Stuart Murdoch on a course for unemployed musicians. It tells of their adventures in two early incarnations of Belle and Sebastian and culminates in the recording of the band's celebrated debut album, Tigermilk. A fascinating portrait of the group and its origins, it is also a story that will resonate with anyone who has put together - or thought of putting together - a band. It is a story of a group of friends who wanted to create a different kind of band and a different kind of music. And how - against all expectations - they succeeded. Written with wit, affection and a novelist's observant eye, In the All-Night Cafe brings to life the music and the early days of this most enigmatic and intriguing of bands.

With her third, Miss Me When I’m Gone, she firmly re-establishes her standing among Laura Lippman, Tana French, Jennifer McMahon, Megan Abbot, and the other major players in the literary mystery game. Arsenault enthralls with this story of what ensues in the shocking aftermath of the sudden, violent death of the successful author of a “honky-tonk Eat, Pray, Love,” when an old college friend of the murdered woman comes across an unpublished manuscript—one which could possibly lead to the writer’s killer. A former lexicographer, English teacher, children’s librarian, and Peace Corps volunteer, Emily Arsenault has found her true calling as an author of twisting, intelligent, emotional, and exceptionally compelling mystery fiction.

Nous les analyserons :    A) - Du point de vue archéologique    B) - Au plan de l'organologie, nous aimerions analyser les traces de ces instruments pour, dans un troisième point :    C) - Tenter de reconstituer la musique qu'ils sont susceptibles de produire et confronter enfin ces résultats avec l'étude archéologique des tablettes inventoriées.    Ici, archéologie et musicologie se recoupent.    L'inventaire aussi bien que les tablettes musicales cuéiformesque des diverses traces d'instruments antiques ( étude iconographique, analyse des pictogrammes, des listes lexicographiques, des textes littéraires, économiques, royaux, religieux ayant trait à la musique, étude et reconstitution des instruments tels qu'on peut rencontrer dans les divers musées de Philadelphie, Paris, Haïfa, Damas, le Caire, Bagdad, etc) et leur confrontation sont pour nous archéologues en musicologie, d'une valeur inestimable puisqu'ils pourraient nous permettre de trouver une vérification de notre hypothèse de départ, telle qu'elle se trouve exprimée dans notre travail de thèse.    Il est à noter que cette aire du Proche-Orient trouve son origine dans l'aire assyrienne, suméro-babylonienne et élamite. C'est cette filiation que nous tenterons d'établir.

Cette publication aborde l'un des aspects éditoriaux les plus singuliers de ce vaste corpus, représenté par cinq psautiers complets parus entre 1624 et 1663 avec l'adjonction de mélodies à voix seule. Dans leur présentation et la disposition même de la musique, ces psautiers semblent adopter un modèle rendu courant depuis le milieu du XVIe siècle, et dont la diffusion la plus large fut assurée à partir de 1562 par le psautier dit ""de Genève"". En pleine époque d'exercice de l'Édit de Nantes, il s'agira d'examiner comment ces cinq psautiers du xvii0 siècle, initialement conçus au sein de milieux catholiques, définissent leur identité mélodique. Entre des tournures relevant d'un écho calculé du psautier réformé, et des procédés au contraire conçus dans le sens d'un éloignement, l'examen des écarts ou des similitudes mélodiques permettra de faciliter la lisibilité d'une véritable cartographie musicale du psautier en vers français au XVIIe siècle, dont il n'existe jusqu'à présent aucun état dans les rares études abordant le sujet.""--P.

Christie's Rock and Pop Memorabilia is the first comprehensive survey of this rapidly expanding market. Based on Christie's long experience in this field, it introduces the reader to the wealth of rock and pop material that has come onto the market over the last twenty years, from the original handwritten lyrics for Let it Be, to the guitar played by Elvis Presley at his first recording session. As well as providing a detailed guide to all the different areas of collecting, it explains how to distinguish between potential collector's items and mass-produced artefacts of little value.

Gli Screaming Trees sono facilmente considerabili tra gli eroi meno conosciuti dell'alternative rock statunitense degli anni Ottanta e Novanta, eppure l'importanza che la band ha avuto in quel periodo è stata immensa: nati dall'incontro tra i fratelli Conner e Mark Lanegan, coadiuvati dal batterista Mark Pickerel prima e da Barrett Martin poi, possono essere considerati tra i pionieri - se non proprio gli anticipatori - dell'ondata grunge che ha travolto il mondo. Attraverso una serie di testimonianze esclusive e resoconti di prima mano, il libro ripercorre in maniera dettagliata i quindici anni di carriera degli Screaming Trees, i loro dischi, così come le peripezie sopra e sotto i palchi. Ma oltre a essere una biografia del gruppo, illustra anche le carriere dei vari membri dopo lo scioglimento. La prefazione del libro è stata scritta appositamente dal chitarrista Gary Lee Conner.

Emerging from the streets of Birmingham, England, GBH pioneered hardcore punk and thrash yet refuse to categorize themselves or their music. ""We play punk rock, period"" says lead singer Colin Abrahall. We just carry on, playing what we like. We never set out to do anything other than that."" GBH never stray far from their working class roots. You are just as likely to find GBH playing a local pub in England as a multi-thousand fan festival in Spain or Japan. The fact is GBH enjoy playing small clubs just as much as large halls. ""Some of my favorite shows in the States are in small towns"", says guitarist Colin ""Jock"" Blyth, ""the kids there don't get a lot of bands coming through. They're so excited and there's so much energy; it's a real communal thing."" GBH maintain a veractive touring schedule which includes headline shows and festivals worldwide. Their brand new Hellcat Records album entitled Momentum will be the band's follow up to the acclaimed 2010 release, Perfume and Piss.

En cada texto se desarrollan las siguientes temáticas básicas en el acercamiento a la música como son: La organización del movimiento (ritmo), naturaleza sonora (melodía), la historia de la música y el acercamiento a los instrumentos (bombo, flauta, guitarra, organeta), cada texto está dado en un lenguaje sencillo y de fácil asimilación para el alumno, con la visión de que el acercamiento a este lenguaje abstracto sea para él un deleite, a la vez que ayuda a su encuentro personal con su yo interno y le sirva para la comunicación.                                                                                             El desarrollo temático se da en una forma gradual donde el concepto aprendido es básico para la asimilación de los que continúan, este saber tiene carácter acumulativo.    El libro ha sido creado con el ánimo de darles a los jóvenes una alternativa diferente de hacerse a un lenguaje universal, representativo en el desarrollo de la humanidad, y a una estimulación de la capacidad creadora a través de los estímulos sonoros.

As part of a collection of heavy metal bands-among them Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth-grouped together under the rubric ""thrash metal,"" Metallica's music presents a number of avenues for investigation. Specifically, Damage Incorporated focuses on identity in popular music as a set of performing conventions, with Metallica's place within certain conventions of genre, race, and gender serving as a constant impetus. The book also engages broadly with larger questions of the politics of culture, American history, musical analysis, and the character of musical discourses in the context of commerce.    An essential book for students of popular culture, mass media, and music, Damage Incorporated sets a new standard for the study and exploration of issues of class, gender, and race in popular music.  About the Author    Glenn T. Pillsbury is a recent Ph.D. in Musicology from UCLA and a rising star in the field of popular music studies. He is the author of the ""Metallica"" chapter in the Encyclopedia Britannica, a founding editor of the online journal ECHO, and a regular presenter of papers at major scholarly meetings in music and the arts.

Tossed the sheets with a bone-knocking fear that only a hard-core hustler could produce? Sexed him like your life depended on it, because in reality it did? You still with me? Then let's roll over to my house. Harlem. 145th Street. Grab a seat and brace yourself as I show you the kind of pain that street life and so-called success can bring. . . .Nineteen-year-old Candy Raye Montana, an ex--drug runner for the Gabriano crime family and a former foster child, dreams of becoming a hip-hop superstar, if only someone will discover her talents.Someone does. Mega music producer and king thug of Harlem, Junius ""Hurricane"" Jackson, CEO of the House of Homicide recording studio, cuts a deal and puts Candy on the stage. Suddenly she is a hot new artist on the notorious Homicide Hitz record label. Her career takes off and she blazes the charts, but it's not long before Candy realizes that the man she thought was her knight is nothing more than a cold-blooded nightmare.Caught between the music and the madness, between the dollars and the deals, Candy belongs to Hurricane--body and soul--and must endure his sadistic bedroom desires while keeping his sexual secrets hidden from the world. But Candy has some strong desires of her own that simply cannot be denied, especially when she finds herself turned on by a brilliant investment baller who just happens to be Hurricane's right-hand man. Candy longs for her freedom, but if Hurricane gets wind of her betrayal the blowback will be lethal--and not only will she risk losing her recording contract, she just might lose her life.From the Trade Paperback edition.

"A fine romance: Jewish songwriters, American songs",David Lehman,music,First published in 2009,/works/OL15070605W,/authors/OL28258A/David_Lehman,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL23169875M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Nextbook/Schocken|Language English,"In A Fine Romance, David Lehman looks at the formation of the American songbook--the timeless numbers that became jazz standards, iconic love songs, and sound tracks to famous movies--and explores the extraordinary fact that this songbook was written almost exclusively by Jews.An acclaimed poet, editor, and cultural critic, David Lehman hears America singing--with a Yiddish accent.  He guides us through America in the golden age of song, when ""Embraceable You,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""Easter Parade,"" ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,"" ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,"" ""My Romance,"" ""Cheek to Cheek,"" ""Stormy Weather,"" and countless others became nothing less than the American sound track. The stories behind these songs, the shows from which many of them came, and the shows from which many of them came, and the composers and lyricists who wrote them give voice to a specifically American saga of love, longing, assimilation, and transformation.Lehman's analytical skills, wit, and exuberance infuse this book with an energy and a tone like no other: at once sharply observant, personally searching, and attuned to the songs that all of us love. He helps us understand how natural it should be that Wizard of Oz composer Harold Arlen was the son of a cantor who incorporated ""Over the Rainbow"" into his Sabbath liturgy, and why Cole Porter--the rare non-Jew in this pantheon of musicians who wrote these classic songs shaped America even as America was shaping them.From the Hardcover edition.

A new book    by DJ Scott Alan Murphy answers those questions & more.  Fun with Oldies is a Book of Lists of your favorite music titles from the 50's, 60's, 70's plus    & Classic Rock Songs based on an idea, theme or genre. It started on Scott's popular radio    show The Starlight Ballroom on station WILW ( Now WIBG )when listener Gearhead Ed asked for some    CAR tunes during Classic Car Week & in following weeks became a regular feature of three song sets called    ""Fun with Oldies"" that loyal listeners soon requested !!!  A sample ""Fun with Oldies"" music    set for CAR tunes might be: Little Deuce Coupe -Beach Boys, GTO - Ronnie & The Daytonas,    & Mustang Sally - Wilson Pickett or for SUSIE Songs like Wake Up Little Susie - Everly     Brothers, Susie Q - Dale Hawkins, & Runaround Sue by Dion. You get the idea !!!

""I  used to write down ideas on little scraps of paper,"" Scott said, "" then I would lose them or    wash them in my jeans. Somebody suggested I put them in a more concrete form!  So that's    when I decided to share this lunacy with the radio community, my listeners, & other oldies    fanatics. Fun with Oldies, the book was born.""  Fun with Oldies is a must have for DJ's, radio listeners, or anyone who just loves oldies music. It is a great reference for ""On Air"" contests, Name That Tune & Trivia Games, or Theme Parties & Promotions.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

A twenty-two-year-old rapper from the Gaza Strip. A young Lebanese singer who quotes Bob Marley's ""Redemption Song."" They are as representative of the world of Islam today as the conservatives and extremists we see every night on the news. Heavy metal, punk, hip-hop, and reggae are each the music of protest, and in many cases considered immoral in the Muslim world. This music may also turn out to be the soundtrack of a revolution unfolding across that world. Why, despite governmental attempts to control and censor them, do these musicians and fans keep playing and listening? Partly, of course, for the joy of self-expression, but also because, in this region, everything is political. In Heavy Metal Islam, Mark LeVine explores the influence of Western music on the Middle East through interviews with musicians and fans, introducing us young Muslims struggling to reconcile their religion with a passion for music and a desire for change. The result is a revealing tour of contemporary Islamic culture through the evolving music scene in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Heavy Metal Islam is a surprising, wildly entertaining foray into a historically authoritarian region where music just might be the true democratizing force.From the Trade Paperback edition.

He trained as a conductor and composer at The Juilliard School, Yale University, and the Peabody Institute. In recent years he has worked as a composer for Tino Sehgal, and Anri Sala among other artists.In his artistic practice Meyers explores the immaterial and social nature of music and searches at the same time for new formal and visual languages to display it.In his work the constant permutation of different levels of time and apace creates situations in which a 'series of futures' are produced - thereby modifying the present by opening endless possibilities.This pocket book interview between art historian, Marie-France Rafael and Ari Benjamin Meyers highlights a multifaceted body of work by an artist who works not only with different media, but also at the border of the arts.In this conversation, Meyers explains his artistic practice and reflects on his own status in the field of art, or what it means ti be a visual artist with musical training and history. Thus one of his principle artistic engagements is how to present and display music.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The exhibition is accompanied by two printed publications. Conceived as constituent works of ""La música es mi casa"", these books incorporate other communicative experiences and perception times, extending the duration and space of the exhibition. The book ""La música es mi casa"" includes the translations of the music lyrics in the audio installation of the same name, presented as a book of poems that explores the visual possibility of rhythm and musicality in the repetition of the printed word. The other book ""La música es mi casa. Featuring"", comprises a series of readings and approaches to the various sides of Pérsico's work. Written especially for this publication, the texts of Mariano Mayer, Pablo Schanton, María Salgado and Marina Zuccon reflect on music, poetry, architecture and sound, forms of perception, disc culture and sound communication, among others. It includes also the text of a lecture by Yves Bonnefoy on Mallarmé and the music, selected by the artist as a reading, which complements and extends the proposal of this work.

'The Road make to Walk' examines the life of the Lord Kitchener(Aldwyn Roberts), one of the legends of Calypso. It examines his life story from his entry into the calypso world to his successful sojourn in England, his return to Trinidad and Tobago where he took up the mantle of the King of the Road, his songs being the most popular on Carnival days, to his coronation as one of the greatest lyricists and tune-smiths in the history of the Calypso artform, ending with his death and his honouring by the people of Trinidad and Tobago.  The second play is 'De Roaring 70's', the dramatic version of the book by the same name (and author). This chronicles the heady decade of the 1970's when the Black Power movement, led by the charismatic Makandal Daaga (Geddes Granger),  and the guerilla thrust championed by Guy Harewood, would try to bring positive changes to the twin island state of Trinidad and Tobago. The plot revolves around a single parent family, Ma Jacob and her two teenage children, Gerard and Beverly, whose lives are forever changed by the experiences of the 1970 movement.

Der Filmkomponist Max Steiner (1888-1971),Peter Wegele,music,First published in 2012,/works/OL20933141W,/authors/OL7597235A/Peter_Wegele,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publisher  Böhlau|Language German|Pages 302,"This is the first monograph about the Austro-American Composer Max Steiner (1888-1971), one of the great pioneers of film music in the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood. In the early 1930ies with his visionary energy he helped to establish symphonic film music as an integrated part in the film production process. In contrary to many of his colleagues, Mr. Steiner had devoted himself completely to film music. Therefore the preoccupation with Max Steiner's music gives a very valuable insight into the craft of film composing. Supported by many quotes and music examples, the first part of this monograph shows how Mr. Steiner wrote his film music. From the first viewing and the spotting session to the final exact timing of the cues, the whole creative and technical process of his film composing is demonstrated. The music of Max Steiner has a couple of quasi formulaic elements: the regular use of leitmotifs, quotations from his own music and the accurate synchronisation of screen action and music cues (with its extreme form, the so-called mickey mousing). The principles of the subjective use of harmonies as well as the technique of instrumentation are shown. The reader will also learn about the special relationship between composer and orchestrator. This distinctive form of collaboration was typical for the Hollywood cinema of the 30ies and 40ies of the 20th century, the so called Golden Age and still is today. Because the studios wanted to save the precious time of their employed composers, they wanted them to write their music on sketch paper with two to four staves, with the themes, voice leadings, harmonies and basic requirements of instrumentation. Then the orchestrator had to transform this into a complete score. Throughout his whole career, Mr. Steiner had been working with three orchestrators. This collaboration reached such an intuitive level, that is was sufficient that Max Steiner wrote only rudimentary musical information. When these sketches had been transformed into scores, Steiner conducted the studio orchestra, where he normally used the click. The second part of the book is based to a big extent on Steiner's yet unpublished autobiography. Born at the end of the 19th century in Vienna, Max Steiner was considered a musical wunderkind. His father as well as his grandfather before him was a famous theatre impresario. One of his teachers was Gustav Mahler. Steiner's first career as composer, arranger and conductor of operettas and musicals led him from Vienna to London and New York and lasted about 30 years. Then, in 1929, he got a call from Hollywood where he fulfilled his determination as dean of film music (Bette Davis). In the 50ies, when the symphonic film music lost its acceptance also Max Steiner's amount of work decreased. In 1965 he wrote his last of more than 300 scores. With the help of original documents from the archive of Warner Bros., such as memos, letters or billings the reader will get a three dimensional insight not only about how the movie Casablanca was made but on the mechanisms of the movie industry as a whole. Parts of the original sketches and the score of the music for Casablanca have been carefully transformed into a piano reduction to demonstrate even more clearly the efficient use of his skills and the yet highly artistic approach of Mr. Steiner Furthermore an example of this film music is compared to an excerpt of Richard Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen. There the reader will see how film music was not only inspired by but precisely obtained musical tools from the late romantic music theatre. Or, in Max Steiner's own words: ""If Wagner would have lived in this century, he would be the number one film composer"". Max Steiner is an outstanding protagonist of a generation of European immigrants who formed the cultural life in the USA. He is an important link between his native city Vienna and his new homeland America and through composers such as Steiner the tradition of the late European romantic m   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It follows the broad outline of its predecessors, but has been completely recast for the benefit of today's training in recording and its allied arts and sciences. Digital recording and signal processing are covered in detail, as are actual studio miking and production techniques -- including the developing field of surround sound. As always, the traditional topics of basic stereo, studio acoustics, analog tape recording, and the stereo LP are covered in greater detail than you are likely to find anywhere except in archival references. This book has been completely updated with numerous new topics added and outdated material removed. Many technical descriptions are now presented in Sidebars, leaving the primary text for more general descriptions. Handbook of Recording Engineering, Fourth Edition is for students preparing for careers in audio, recording, broadcast, and motion picture sound work. It will also be useful as a handbook for professionals already in the audio workplace. _ John Eargle has consulted extensively in electroacoustical product development, primarily with JBL Incorporated and other companies in the Harman International group. He also founded his own company, now called JME Consulting Corporation. He has published numerous technical articles, and his books, Handbook of Recording Engineering, The Microphone Handbook, Handbook of Sound System Design, Electroacoustical Reference Data, Music, Sound, and Technology, and The Loudspeaker Handbook, are considered classics in the field. He currently holds the position of Senior Director of Product Development and Application for JBL Professional.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Gollanz.,              Orion Publishing Group, Limited|Language English|Pages 206","Kathy Etchingham ran away from home, not for the first time, when she was sixteen.    Escaping from a miserable and disturbed childhood, she landed in London in the centre of the swinging sixties and among a clique of musicians who were in the process of changing the world.  Friends included Brian Jones, Keith Moon, Pete Townshend, Lennon and McCartney, Eric Burdon, Chas Chandler, Georgie Fame, Eric Clapton and many more.    These people lived together, played together, ate together, drank together, did drugs together and, occasionally, slept together.  In 1966 Chas Chandler brought Jimi Hendrix to London. Jimi and Kathy met on the day he arrived and their relationship as lovers lasted for almost three years, during which time Jimi became acclaimed as one of the greatest and most original guitarists in the world.    But as the trappings of fame and wealth were heaped upon him, darker forces came into play. Drugs clouded his mind, men in suits manipulated his finances and his life with Kathy became cluttered with fantasists, dopeheads and hangers-on. He and Kathy separated. Jimi's death the following year epitomized the end of the sixties' dream.  Kathy left the music scene, married, had two sons and put her former life behind her.  But nearly twenty years after Hendrix's death, the past came back to haunt her. Kathy was dragged into a series of court cases to protect friends and herself. It ended in more tragedy.  In this book Kathy sets the record straight about her life with the rock legend, and offers a new theory of what actually happened the night Hendrix died.

In Part I musical developments are placed in the context of the socio-political upheavals of inter-war Poland, Nazi occupation, and the rise and fall of the Stalinist policy of socialist realism (1948-54). Part II investigates the nature of the 'thaw' between 1954 and 1959, focusing on the role of the 'Warsaw Autumn' Festival.  Part III discusses how composers reacted to the onset of serialism by establishing increasingly individual voices in the 1960s. In addition to a discussion of 'sonorism' (from Penderecki to Szalonek), it considers how different generations responded to the modernist aesthetic (Bacewicz and Lutoslawski, Baird and Serocki, GUrecki and Krauze). Part IV views Polish music since the 1970s, including the issue of national identity and the arrival of a talented new generation and its ironic, postmodern slant on the past.

Las primeras expresiones de música folclórica norteamericana que más tarde darían forma al género llegaron a la Argentina a fines del siglo XIX y, desde entonces, ya sea como forma musical independiente o como parte del repertorio de los músicos de jazz, la presencia e influencia del blues fue creciente. A partir de la década del sesenta, en el contexto de un redescubrimiento y revalorización a nivel internacional, el blues en la Argentina comenzó a adquirir características particulares de la mano del naciente rock nacional que lo adoptó como parte de su lenguaje. Pero fue durante los noventa donde las frecuentes presentaciones de músicos internacionales en el país entre los cuales se pudo ver tanto a legendarios como a jóvenes bluesmen estadounidenses que el blues local vivió un inesperado boom que, en las décadas siguientes, no ha dejado de crecer y expandirse. Este recorrido por las apasionantes historias de los músicos, los grupos, los lugares, los estilos, los viajes y los amantes de este arte en el país confirma que el blues se ha convertido en parte de la música y la cultura argentina.  The blues originated in the southern United States but reached spread globally. The first expressions of American folk music that later would shape the genre came to Argentina in the late nineteenth century and, since then, either as an independent musical form or as part of the repertoire of jazz musicians, the presence and influence of blues was growing. From the sixties, in the context of a rediscovery and appreciation internationally, the blues in Argentina began to acquire particular characteristics of the hand of the nascent national rock which adopted it as part of their language. But it was during the nineties where frequent performances of international musicians in the country, among which could be seen both legendary bluesmen as young Americans-the local blues lived an unexpected boom that in the following decades, has not stopped grow and expand. This journey through the exciting stories of the musicians, groups, places, styles, travel and lovers of this art in the country confirms that the blues has become part of the music and culture of Argentina.

Die streitbare Auseinandersetzung mit einer einstmals dominanten und bis heute im Musikleben präsenten Persönlichkeit bleibt zugleich auch für einen weiten Kreis von Musikinteressierten relevant.

Many aspects of music -- harmony, counterpoint (melody) whether that of centuries sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, or twenty; rhythm, invertible counterpoint, polyphony, contrapuntal composition (canon, invention, fugue), form and analysis, orchestration - - are inadequately treated in any textbook which has been published during the past century and a half. I have included samples of compositions by several of my students; these present a conon (2 in 1), (3 in 1) and (4 in 2), a two-voice invention, a three-voice invention, a two-voice fughetta, and a theme and variations based on a medieval chorale.""

Töne und Schälle,Roman Brotbeck,music,First published in 2022,/works/OL31894863W,/authors/OL859484A/Roman_Brotbeck,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2022|Publisher  Brill Fink|Language German|Pages 660,"Das Buch liefert die erste Studie zur musikalischen Walser-Rezeption mit über 200 Werken von über 100 Komponistinnen und Komponisten. Anhand der zahlreichen Walser-Vertonungen entsteht eine anschauliche Musik-, Literatur- und Kulturgeschichte der letzten 110 Jahre abseits der grossen Erzähllinien. Dabei wird mittels detaillierter Werkanalysen ein überraschender Blick auf Robert Walser und sein Schreiben freigelegt. Roman Brotbeck stellt die Lieder, Melodramen, Hörspiele, Filme und Musiktheaterstücke in neue Kontexte, vernetzt sie untereinander und schafft Verbindungen zu anderen Künsten. Neues und Exklusives ist zu entdecken, denn viele Namen sind bisher kaum bekannt, so auch der 1944 in Auschwitz ermordete Komponist James Simon, der 1912 als Erster ein Gedicht von Walser vertont hat.

Tracking an American original--from his Jewish roots to his controversial embrace of Jesus to his enduring legacy as the composer of the Tempest album--Bob Dylan: A Spiritual Life delivers the story of a man in dogged pursuit of redemption. Based on years of research and original interviews, this book sorts through the myths and misunderstandings and reveals Dylan to be both traditional and radical in the way he expresses his spiritual quest for purpose and meaning. 'Call Dylan whatever you want, but the name won't stick,' said foreword writer and film director Scott Derrickson. 'What does stick is his music, in part because his songs contain a deep, abiding spirituality that moves listeners like me more than the songs of any other artist.'""--Dust jacket flap.

Informed by the most current scholarship and new imaging technologies, it will comprise a comprehensive history of the trumpet and related instruments and a complete photographic catalog of the Utley Collection. Volume 1 traces the development of high brass instruments without valves or keys from antiquity through the 20th-century Baroque trumpet revival. It covers ethnic instruments from many cultures, the emergence of the trumpet in Europe and dominant designs of the 16th through 18th centuries. The inclusion of military and signal trumpets, bugles, and such oddities as bicycle bugles and walking-stick trumpets enhances an already rich survey. Available only in hardcover, Volume 1 includes 358 pages in an 8-1/2"" x 11"" format and features more than 800 illustrations in full color.

Wagner's Ring cycle and the Greeks,Daniel H.

This book demonstrates how, by turning theory into practice, Wagner used this evolutionary paradigm to shape the music and the libretto of the Ring cycle. Foster describes how each of the Ring's operas represents a particular phase of Greek poetic and political development: Das Rheingold and Die Walküre create epic national identity in its earlier and later stages respectively; Siegfried expresses lyric personal identity; and Götterdammerung destructively culminates with a tragi-comedy about civic identity. This study sees the Greeks through the lens of those scholars whose work influenced Wagner most, focusing on epic, lyric, and comedy, as well as Greek tragedy. Most significantly, the book interrogates the ways in which Wagner uses Greek aesthetics to further his own ideological goals""--Provided by publisher.

Authors Fung and Lehmberg clearly define the issues surrounding music education, music participation, and quality of life of senior citizens. They bring into the discussion the most relevant research from the fields of music education, adult learning, lifelong learning, gerontology, medicine, music therapy, and interdisciplinary studies. At the heart of the book is Evergreen Town, a retirement community in the southeastern USA, that serves as the backdrop for three original research studies. The first of these studies is in two phases, a survey and a focus group interview, that examines the histories and rationales for the music participations and non-participations of community residents. The second and third studies look in-depth at a church choir and a bluegrass group, two prominent musical groups in the community, and include the perspectives of the authors themselves as group members and participant-observers. Fung and Lehmberg conclude with a challenge for the profession of music education: to act on this research and on the current advances in the field, to enable all people to benefit from the richness of music as a substantial contributor to quality of life. - Back cover.

The effect of directed focus on the peripheral hearing of undergraduate instrumental music majors,Dennis J. Hayslett,music,First published in 1991,/works/OL11867789W,/authors/OL5079184A/Dennis_J._Hayslett,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Publisher  s.n.]|Language English|Pages 136,"Efficient error detection skills, as a primary competency for     the conductor/teacher, can be facilitated by developing advanced    aural perception abilities so that incoming auditory stimuli can     be sensed and perceived accurately.  This study compares aural     perception to the visual perception process, theorizing that     attention to a particular auditory stream causes concurrent auditory streams to be perceived in a manner analogous to     peripheral vision, here termed ""peripheral hearing.""         Because error detection requires focusing on a single errant     auditory stream from among many incoming streams, the primary     question was to determine the effect of this singular focus upon     the simultaneous perception of concurrent auditory streams.  A     secondary purpose was to examine the effect that acquiring an     aural ""template"" of the stimulus had upon this perception.    Procedure         An aural test containing three-line printed scores of short    musical excerpts was administered to 178 undergraduate     instrumental music majors from eight colleges and universities,     who indicated errors or departures from the printed scores made by     a recorded ensemble.  Subjects' focus was directed to a specific musical line, and maintained on that line by the insertion of     obvious errors on several excerpts, whereupon a concurrent line     was simultaneously deleted.  Detection of the deleted musical line     was measured to indicate the extent of peripheral hearing.         To measure the effect that an aural template of the test familiarization procedure with a recorded piece of music.  Half of    the test excerpts were drawn from this piece (internal aural template piece) and half were drawn from unfamiliar (non-template)     music.  Conclusions         1. When aural focus was directed to one musical line through     instruction and/or the insertion of an error as a ""focus     re-inforcer,"" accuracy of perception in concurrent parts was     reduced significantly.         2. Perception within all areas of test items drawn from music     for which subjects possessed an internal aural template was     significantly more accurate.         3. Detection of an alteration to a peripheral musical part    was highest when the part was the melody and next highest when it     was the bass line.         4. The lower percentage of deleted parts detected compared to     the percentage of focus re-inforcers detected suggests a possible     hierarchy of detectability among types of errors and     discrepancies.

But that was just the beginning. Through the second half of that turbulent decade, Turkish rock warped and transformed, striking out into wilder and stranger territory - fuelled by the psychedelic revolution and played out over a backdrop of cultural, social and political turmoil. The Turkish Psychedelic Music Explosion tells the story of a musical movement that was brought to an end by a right-wing coup in 1980, largely forgotten and only recently being rediscovered by Western crate-diggers. It's a tale of larger-than-life musical pioneers with raging political passions and visionary ideas ripe for rediscovery.""--Publisher description.

Using a broad understanding of ‘knowledge,’ the first part of the book presents aspects of the practitioner knowledge a musician develops through daily exercises and performances. Technical and practical skills, creativity and music reading are central topics. Part II describes four different methodologies of knowledge accumulation. First is the hypothetico-deductive method (music as object). Then the author asks, “Where is the musical work?” After an introduction to semiotics, the question that must follow is “Is music a language?” Following up methodologies focusing on intersubjective and contextual topics, the presentation of hermeneutics generates the question “What happens to the music when you are listening?” Being the most subjective, phenomenology is the last methodology to be presented. The question it poses is “Are analysis and interpretation two sides of the same coin?” Artistic research is a new perspective in knowledge acquisition, and the performing artist is the pivot point. The obvious insight positioning music beyond the score is elaborated into a critique of the representational theory as a relevant ontological discourse in music. As an alternative, the potential in embodied meaning theories is discussed through cognitive, linguistic and artistic approaches. Artistic expressions convey the subjective practitioner knowledge based on the difference between the objective sign and the intersubjective expression. This makes music as communication the ultimate topic. In conclusion, understanding the meaning construction and the conditions of artistic content are both of importance in artistic research.

Now, in this intimate and uncompromising memoir, one of the bestselling female rock artists of all time shares the story of her extraordinary career, telling the truth about her life, her struggles, and how she won things—her way.From her early days in the New York club scene of the 1970s to headlining sold-out arena tours, Benatar offers a fascinating account of a life spent behind the microphone. As the first female artist ever to be played on MTV, she speaks candidly about the realities of breaking into the boys' club of rock and roll at a time when people everywhere still believed a woman's only place in popular music was as a girlfriend, a groupie, or a sex symbol. And though her fiery edge and aggressive swagger produced instant success, they also led to fights over her image that would linger for years to come.Going backstage and into the studio, Benatar sets the record straight about how her music evolved, illustrating the visionary role that her guitarist, producer, and eventual husband, Neil ""Spyder"" Giraldo, played in combining her classically trained voice with razor-sharp guitar to create her unique hard-rock sound. Together they formed a musical and spiritual bond that would last a lifetime, helping her stay true to herself while avoiding the pitfalls and excesses of rock stardom.Written with the attitude and defiance that embodies Pat Benatar's music, Between a Heart and a Rock Place is a rock-and-roll story unlike any other, a remarkable tale of playing by your own rules, even if that means breaking a fewof theirs.

With unprecedented access to the musicians, singers, and studio engineers who knew Prince best, including members of The Revolution and The Time, Duane Tudahl weaves an intimate saga of an eccentric genius and the people and events who helped shape the groundbreaking music he created.

Surprised by beauty,Robert R.

Noise--and its acceptance as music--was the product of the resulting spiritual confusion and, in its turn, became the further cause of its spread. Likewise, the recovery of modern music, the theme to which this book is dedicated, stems from a spiritual recovery. This is made explicitly clear by the composers whose interviews with the author are collected in this book. Robert Reilly spells out the nature of the crisis and its solution in sections that serve as bookends to the chapters on individual composers. He does not contend that all of these composers underwent and recovered from the central crisis he describes, but they all lived and worked within its broader context, and soldiered on, writing beautiful music. For this, they suffered ridicule and neglect, and he believes their rehabilitation will change the reputation of modern music. It is the spirit of music that this book is most about, and in his efforts to discern it, Reilly has discovered many treasures. The purpose of this book is to share them, to entice you to listen--because beauty is contagious. English conductor John Eliot Gardiner writes that experiencing Bach's masterpieces ""is a way of fully realizing the scale and scope of what it is to be human"". The reader may be surprised by how many works of the 20th and 21st centuries of which this is also true [Publisher description]   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Delving into the reasons for Newman's peripheral status on the cultural landscape, this suggests that, at heart, he has always been a musical outsider, that he has even built his mainstream career on a brilliant disguise. Using the conventions of American pop as a devious strategy, Newman incorporates into his barbed and satirical work the role of the untrustworthy narrator. In his songs, he wickedly enacts character dramas in order to play a variety of dubious roles: a slave trader in ""Sail Away,"" a stalker in ""Suzanne,"" a born-again yuppie in ""It's Money That I Love,"" and an American demagogue in ""Political Science."" This is an illuminating portrait of an American artist as a masked man, an artful dodger who remains an American music enigma.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This guide provides track-by-track dissection of every song produced during the OK Computer recording sessions, including B-sides, and illustrates how the 1997 album is a collection of songs purposefully placed next to one another. Themes prevalent on the album—such as fear of the new millennium, paranoia, political sloganeering, and suicide—and its artistic and political influences are explored, while discussions of the state of the music industry during the album’s release provide rare insight into the improbability of a similarly phenomenal record ever being created.

Undertones of Insurrection,Marc Weiner,music,First published in 2017,/works/OL21344593W,/authors/OL8177866A/Marc_Weiner,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2017|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""A basic tenet of literary studies is that aesthetic structures are politically significant because they represent an artist's response to the political implications of cultural codes with which the recipient of the modern work is also acquainted. This tenet provides the basis for the ideological associations attending the appearance of music in the modern German narrative. With his understanding of the arts as involved in often unacknowledged ideological forces within a culture, Marc Weiner's Undertones of Insurrection bridges the gap between the ""New Musicology's"" rewarding infusion of modern cultural and literary theory into the study of music, politically insightful examinations of narrative structures in the modern novel, and the methodologically conservative area of musical-literary relations in Germanic Studies. In other words, the questions it raises are different from those pursued in most examinations of music and literature, because previous works of this kind concerning the literature of German-speaking Europe have often disregarded social concerns in general, and political issues in particular. Ranging from 1900 to Doctor Faustus (1947), Weiner study sets the stage by examining public debates that conflated such issues as national identity, racism, populism, the role of the sexes, and xenophobia with musical texts. In the literary analyses that follow, Weiner discusses both obvious connections between music and sociopolitical issues--Hesse's equation of jazz and insurrection in Steppenwolf--and covert ones, the suppression of music in Death in Venice and the use of politically charged musical subtexts in Werfel's Verdi and Schnitzler's Rhapsody. By uncovering the ideological agendas informing cultural practice in modernist Germany, Undertones of Insurrection calls for a reevaluation of the function of music in the modern German narrative.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Social media evaluation practices?rating, ranking, voting, ?liking,? and ?friending? by ordinary users, peers, and critics?have become essential promotional tools for musicians. In this report, H. Cecilia Suhr examines one recent development in online music evaluation: the use of digital badges to aid in assessment and evaluation. Digital badges have emerged in recent years as a potential credentialing method in informal learning environments. Suhr explores online music communities' use of digital badges as a reward for both casual music evaluators and musicians.Suhr examines the intersection of evaluation and gamification in Spotify's ?Hit or Not? game, in which players assess a song's hit potential and receive digital badges as rewards, and considers the implications of turning music evaluation into a game. She then explores in detail the development of peer and professional critics on Indaba Music, a cloud-based collaboration platform where musicians earn badges through participating in contests. Suhr considers the emerging challenges and shortcomings of contest-based virtual communities and the value of badges, as perceived by Indaba musicians. She investigates to what extent digital badges can effectively represent and credit musicians' accomplishments and merits; describes the challenges, benefits, and shortcomings of digital badges as an evaluation mechanism; and compares the use of digital badges in assessing creativity to their use in learning and credentialing institutions.

A tale of how a self-taught, drunken hipster in roach-killers and a dirty beret has influenced a generation of musicians with his sound, warmth, and willingness to take chances, this biography shows how he has moved between sideshow barker and evocative troubadour with ease, recording almost 20 albums that range from cabaret to movie soundtracks. Waits encapsulates the wink-and-nudge of a Vaudevillian and the rhythm and heart of a beatnik, and his fans span a similarly wide spectrum, drawn in by his candor and humor. But off stage, he has resolutely protected his private life even as he and his wife-collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, publicly experiment with innovative recording techniques and instrumentation. A complete discography, as well as a look at Waits' film and theater careers, rounds out this exploration of a great, self-styled, genre-hopping enigma—the poet laureate of the streetlit American night.

Sixties rock music left behind the harmless bubblegum and surfing ditties of the 1950s to become a vehicle for the thoughtful commentary upon the human condition. Theories and motifs from philosophy, theology, and literature were reshaped, refracted, and transfigured in this intelligent new popular art form.    Classic rock, argues James harris, should be taken as seriously as the loftiest creations of art and literature. In 'Philosophy at 33 1/3 rpm,' he lays the groundwork for an informed appreciation by exhibiting philosophical themes in the finest rock songs.  Professor Harris's examples encompass all the major rock artists of the classic period (1962-1974), including Paul Simon, Elton John, Pink Floyd, The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, The Moody Blues, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Kinks, Cat Stevens, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Joni Mitchell.  His analyses draw upon the ideas of Aristotle, Bonhoeffer, Camus, Descartes, Freud, Kant, Laing, Marcuse, Marx, Nietzche, Nozick, Rousseau, Sartre, Thoroeau, and Tillich, as well as the Bible and other scriptures, to situate the preoccupations of the classic rock lyricists in the Western intellectual tradition.

Richter,music,First published in 2013,/works/OL20933681W,/authors/OL8013011A/Max_M._Richter,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,"Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Institute of Southeast Asian Studies,              KITLV Press|Language English|Pages 210","Musical worlds in Yogyakarta is an ethnographic account of a vibrant Indonesian city during the turbulent early post-Soeharto years. The book examines musical performance in public contexts ranging from the street and neighbourhood through to commercial venues and state environments such as Yogyakarta?s regional parliament, its military institutions, universities and the Sultan?s palace. It focuses on the musical tastes and practices of street workers, artists, students and others. From street-corner jam sessions to large-scale concerts, a range of genres emerge that cohere around notions of campursari (?mixed essences?) and jalanan (?of the street?). Musical worlds addresses themes of social identity and power, counterpoising Pierre Bourdieu?s    theories on class, gender and nation with the author?s alternative perspectives of inter-group social capital, physicality and grounded cosmopolitanism. The author argues that Yogyakarta is exemplary of how everyday people make use of music to negotiate issues of power and at the same time promote peace and intergroup appreciation in culturallydiverse inner-city settings.    Max M. Richter is director of the Monash Asia Institute and lecturer in Anthropology at Monash University, Australia. He has published in international journals and edited book collections, and has given presentations on Indonesian music and society in several countries and forums. His current research focuses on local-level music performance, intellectual/power-broker gatherings and centre/region identities in urban Indonesia.

With 90 million of the band’s records sold worldwide since 1987, Guns N’ Roses prolonged rock music past its sell-by date with controversial albums and immense, often riotous world tours. But the band’s complete story has never been fully told—until now. In his sixth major rock biography, Stephen Davis details the riveting story of a band that originated in the gutters of Sunset Strip and went on to set attendance records on the biggest stadiums on the planet. Watch You Bleed documents the improbable story of W. Axl Rose, the biggest rock star of his generation. Taken from an abusive father in his infancy, he was raised as “Bill Bailey” in a strictly religious Indiana household by a stepfather who beat him for playing Led Zeppelin songs on the family piano. After quitting high school, and on the run from the police in his hometown, Axl arrived in Los Angeles in the midst of the street battles for supremacy among the top music genres of the eighties—post-punk, thrash, hair metal, and glam. The book also charts the backgrounds of every band member, especially Slash, a Hollywood street kid whose designer mother dated David Bowie. Davis brilliantly captures the birth of Guns’ raw power, which—despite rape charges, drug-induced rampages, and a general appetite for destruction— launched the band into the pantheon of rock gods such as Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. With a wealth of detail, Davis looks at Axl’s unrelenting quest to release the long-awaited, mystery-shrouded Chinese Democracy album, as well as the further adventures of some of the Gunners under the banner of the hard-rocking band Velvet Revolver. For the first time, millions of Guns N’ Roses fans will learn the whole truth—sometimes funny, sometimes tragic—about the last of the great rock bands.

Jahrhundert gab es neben den Herstellern in der Schweiz und einigen wenigen im benachbarten französischen Jura nur in Prag und Wien eine Produktion von Spieldosen. Während die Schweizer Erzeugnisse als Exportartikel ersten Ranges weltbekannt wurden, beschränkte sich die Verbreitung der österreichischen Produkte im Wesentlichen auf die k. k. Monarchie und auf osteuropäische Länder. Die Hersteller in Prag und Wien haben sowohl in konstruktiver als auch in musikalischer Hinsicht einen von der Schweizer Entwicklung unabhängigen und eigenständigen Weg beschritten. Diesen österreichischen Herstellern und ihren Spielwerken ist das vorliegende Buch gewidmet. Als Ergebnis eines seit 1980 laufenden Forschungsprojektes und einer Bestandsaufnahme von über 1300 Prager und Wiener Spielwerken können hier nun eine exakte Typologie der Spielwerke und eine Charakterisierung ihrer Musik vorgestellt werden. Anhand von reichhaltigem Bildmaterial wird die Entwicklung der Spielwerke dargestellt, und die Analysen etlicher Beispiele des charakteristischen musikalischen Repertoires vermitteln mit Hilfe beigefügter Notentexte einen Eindruck von der Musik und vom typischen Arrangement auf den österreichischen Spielwerken. Historische Nachrichten und biographische Angaben zu den Herstellern runden das Bild der Produktion in Prag und Wien ab. Den Schluss der Arbeit bildet ein Katalog der Spielwerke mit ausführlichen Informationen zu den einzelnen Instrumenten.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The album is dominated by powerfully melodic, mid-tempo numbers played with relaxed expertise. But there's also ambitious stylistic range displayed with the inclusion of evanescent ballads like 'Meet Me At the Lookout Point, ' the epic riff-rocker 'Rats' sprightly R & B flavored groovers on 'Baby, ' and the sultry Latin-flavored stunner 'Brindo, ' the Roxy-inspired '16th & Valencia Roxy Music' among other pleasant surprises.""--Amazon.com.
