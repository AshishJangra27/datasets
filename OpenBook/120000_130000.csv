All these systems contain large internal interfaces which enable and catalyze very different reactions in many fields of chemistry. The book publishes lectures presented at a meeting of the ""Fast Reactions in Solution""--Group of the Royal Society of Chemistry held at the Centre of Interdisciplinary Research, Bielefeld. Because of the interdisciplinarity of the audience, the authors emphasize the principles and the general background of their research. The Plenary lectures review the applications of microemulsions as liquid media for chemical reactions (M. Kahlweit), the effect of fractal geometry on chemical reactions (P. Meakin), elementary reaction at interfaces (F. Wilkinson) and fast reactions in pharmacy (J. Crooks). Further contributions report on reactions in compartmentalized liquids in the fields of physical chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics and food research.

Among the old, dusty hardbacks was a book called At Home on the Range, written by her great-grandmother, Margaret Yardley Potter. As Gilbert writes in her Foreword: 'I jumped up and dashed through the house to find my husband, so I could read parts of it to him: Listen to this! The humor! The insight! The sophistication! Then I followed him around the kitchen while he was making our dinner (lamb shanks), and I continued reading aloud as we ate ... By the end of the night there were three of us sitting at that table. Gima had come to join us, and she was wonderful, and I was in love.' The cookbook was far ahead of its time. In it, Potter espouses the importance of farmer's markets and ethnic food (Italian, Jewish and German), derides preservatives and culinary shortcuts and generally celebrates a devotion to epicurean adventures. Potter takes car trips out to Pennsylvania Dutch country to eat pickled pork products, and to the eastern shore of Maryland, where she learns to catch and prepare eels so delicious, she says, they must be 'devoured in a silence almost devout'. Part scholar and part crusader for a more open food conversation than currently existed, it's not hard to see where Elizabeth Gilbert inherited both her love of food and her warm, infectious prose. At Home on the Range is a fascinating, humorous and useful cookbook from the past that is essential for the present day.   Read more Read less",6 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it’s cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own dish?  More than just a cookbook, Cooking for Geeks inspires you to be inventive in the kitchen and piques your curiosity about food. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do you bake some things at 350°F/175°C and others at 375°F/190°C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if you “overclock” an oven to 1,000°F/540°C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes—from the sweet (a “mean” chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo). This book is an excellent and intriguing resource if you want to experiment with cooking—regardless of whether you consider yourself a geek.         Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools        Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, the Maillard reaction, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods you cook        Play with your food, using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking        Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and even a comic from xkcd.com     Read more Read less",9 Want to read|1 Currently reading|5 Have read

Midnight Chicken (& Other Recipes Worth Living For) is a cookbook. Or, at least, you'll flick through these pages and find recipes so inviting that you'll head straight for the kitchen: roast garlic and tomato soup, uplifting chilli-lemon spaghetti, charred leek lasagne, squash skillet pie, spicy fish finger sandwiches or burnt-butter brownies. It's the kind of cooking you can do a little bit drunk. It's the kind of cooking that is probably better if you've got a bottle of wine open, and a hunk of bread to mop up the sauce.  But if you sit down with this book and a cup of tea (or that glass of wine), you'll also discover that it's an annotated list of things worth living for: a manifesto of moments worth living for. Because there was a time when, for Ella Risbridger, the world had become overwhelming. Sounds were too loud, colours were too bright, everyone moved too fast. One night she found herself lying on her kitchen floor, wondering if she would ever get up - and it was the thought of a chicken, of roasting it, and of eating it, that got her to her feet, and made her want to be alive.  This is a cookbook to make you fall in love with the world again.   Read more Read less",5 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Best known as a provocative novelist, journalist and film-maker, Jonathan Meades has also been called 'the best amateur chef in the world' by Marco Pierre White. His contention here is that anyone who claims to have invented a dish is delusional, dishonestly contributing to the myth of culinary originality. Meades delivers a polemical but highly usable collection of 125 of his favourite recipes, each one an example of the fine art of culinary plagiarism. These are dishes and methods he has hijacked, adapted, improved upon and made his own. Without assuming any special knowledge or skill, the book is full of excellent advice. He tells us why the British never got the hang of garlic. That a purist would never dream of putting cheese in a Gratin Dauphinois. That cooking brains in brown butter cannot be improved upon. And why - despite the advice of Martin Scorsese's mother - he insists on frying his meatballs. Adorned with his own abstract monochrome images (none of which 'illustrate' the stolen recipes they accompany), The Plagiarist in the Kitchen is a stylish object, both useful and instructive. In a world dominated by health fads, food vloggers and over-priced kitchen gadgets, it is timely reminder that, when it comes to food, it's almost always better to borrow than to invent.

Soweit das Klischee! Dass aber Kochen viel mit Programmieren zu tun hat, dass es nämlich ähnlich kreativ ist, dass viele Wege zum individuellen Ziel führen und dass manche Rezepte einfach nur abgefahren und - ja, geekig sind: Das zeigen zwei Köchinnen in diesem Buch. Das in der bewährten O'Reilly-Rezeptstruktur aus Problem, Lösung und Diskussion aufgebaute Kochbuch gliedert sich in drei Teile. Im ersten Teil (für das „Larvenstadium"") werden die absoluten Anfänger und ganz hilflosen Geeks an die Hand genommen. Einfachste coole Rezepte nehmen die Schwellenangst und machen Lust auf mehr. Im zweiten Teil (""für Mamas Liebling"") werden schon richtige Mahlzeiten zubereitet - alle Rezepte haben dabei immer etwas Besonderes, weichen von den ausgetretenen Pfaden ab. Und im dritten Teil gibt es Rezepte für den echten „Küchengeek"", der mit ganz ungewöhnlichen und eigenen „Hacks“ beeindrucken und Spaß haben will. Die Rezepte werden von coolen Tipps zu Nahrungsmitteln, Küchengeräten und Rezeptdatenbanken flankiert. — O'Reilly  Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

The author of Wood for Sheep: The Unauthorized Settlers Cookbook is about to take your taste buds on a wibbly wobbly, timey wimey adventure through the Doctor Who reboot.  Megafan and food writer Chris-Rachael Oseland spent a year rewatching all of series one through six and experimenting in her kitchen to bring you a fresh recipe for every single episode.  This book is a treat for any Whovian who wants to offer more than a plate of fish fingers and a bowl of custard at your next viewing party. Want to host an elegant dinner party to show off your new Tardis corset? Start the evening with a Two Streams Garden Cocktail followed by Baked Hath, Marble Cucumber Circuits with Vesuvian Fire Dipping Sauce, Professor Yana’s Gluten Neutrino Map Binder, Slitheen Eggs, and some of Kazran’s Night Sky Fog Cups for dessert.  If you’re just getting a few friends together to watch the latest episode, why not offer them an Ood Mezze Plate to munch on as stragglers wander in followed by some quick and easy Fish Custard Tacos, Open Faced Dalek Ironsides, Sontaran Soldiers, and a Cinnamon Pull Apart Crack in the Wall. They can wash it all down with a cup of the Pond’s Wedding Punch.  Lets be honest. No Whovian gathering is complete without them, so you also get an entire bonus chapter dedicated to interesting alternative takes on fish fingers and custard.  This comprehensive cookbook includes eighteen adult beverages, more than two dozen recipes for vegetarians, twenty that are safe for people with wheat allergies, and ten for the low carb dieters. You’ll be prepared for every possible guest.  The ebook also includes over 50 full color photos, a linked table of contents for easy navigation, and a useful appendix.

A foodie and former chef, Franklin wants to pass on her love of food and cooking to her kids; she wants them not only to enjoy what they’re eating but to know what they’re eating. So, over the course of a year, she introduces her children to new dishes—some exotic, some thrown together with whatever she has in her cabinets—with varying degrees of success. Undaunted by failure (“This tastes like sand!”), Franklin pursues her culinary mission from the heartland of Indiana to the Umbrian countryside. Some meals conjure visions of pleasure while others are utter catastrophes. Along the way, she discovers how a delicious (or even disastrous) meal can bring families together and feed the soul.As Franklin chronicles her family’s year around the kitchen table, season by season, she shares original recipes. From comfort, kid-friendly food like Mummy Nuggets, to the more adventurous Saffron Fish Chowder, to food made on the fly like Orange-Oaty-I-Don’t-Know Cookies, each recipe follows a charming or bittersweet or laugh-out-loud anecdote that captures the chaos of cooking for four young kids.Franklin seasons her stories with how-I-did-it advice on cooking and parenting that makes this such a delightful and inspiring read. And with more than 100 simple, mouthwatering dishes, Too Many Cooks is a happy mix of recipes, memories, and good storytelling.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Studying cookbooks from various Western cultures and languages, Henry Notaker traces the transformation of recipes from brief notes with ingredients into detailed recipes with a specific structure, grammar, and vocabulary. In addition, he reveals that cookbooks go far beyond offering recipes: they tell us a great deal about nutrition, morals, manners, history, and menus while often providing entertaining reflections and commentaries. This innovative book demonstrates that cookbooks represent an interesting and important branch of nonfiction literature.""--Provided by publisher.

In addition to the recipes, you will find useful information on cooking techniques, hints on buying food and wise shopping, 'emergency' dishes, and helpful suggestions for dealing with minor mishaps in the kitchen.  In planning the book, I have tried to include recipes to suit every budget—they range from ideas for those cooking a meal for a small household on a limited income to lavish suggestions for buffet and dinner parties; and I have included special recipes for slimmers, invalids, vegetarians, etc.  Many of the dishes in this book are illustrated by colour photographs which, in addition to being inspiring, will help you to present the finished dish as attractively as possible. I would like to express my thanks to the Home Economists and firms who contributed these pictures.

Dit boek belicht de speerpunten van een rijke culinaire traditie, van een heterogene samenleving en een machtig (doch naar de nieuwste tijd toe kwijnend) rijk op het kruispunt tussen Oost en West. Internationale onderzoekers leverden hiertoe een bijdrage. De focus ligt sterk op een bruggenhoofd, Istanbul, een van de meest vibrerende steden in Europa, het Berlijn van het Zuiden. In zes hoofdstukken wordt een verhaal opgediend over eten en drinken in het Ottomaanse tijdperk. Gebonden aan of gesteund op het beschikbare bronnenmateriaal en op het spanningsveld tussen sociale geschiedenis en culinair erfgoed tracht elke onderzoeker voor zich een antwoord te formuleren op de vraag hoe het verhaal van (de constructie van) de 'Ottomaanse' en daarna 'Turkse keuken' tot ontwikkeling kwam.

These are the ingredients of The Recipe Club, a ""novel cookbook"" that combines an authentic story of friendship with more than 80 delicious recipes.Lilly and Val are lifelong friends, united as much by their differences as by their similarities. Lilly, dramatic and confident, lives in the shadow of her beautiful, wayward mother and craves the attention of her distant, disapproving father. Val, shy and idealistic—and surprisingly ambitious— struggles with her desire to break free from her demanding housebound mother and a father whose dreams never seem to come true.In childhood, ""LillyPad"" and ""ValPal"" form an exclusive two-person club, writing intimate letters in which they share hopes, fears, deepest secrets—and recipes, from Lilly's ""Lovelorn Lasagna"" to Valerie's ""Forgiveness Tapenade."" Readers can cook along as the friends travel through time facing the challenges of independence, the joys and heartbreaks of first love, and the emotional complexities of family relationships, identity, mortality, and goals deferred.The Recipe Club sustains Lilly and Val's bond through the decades, regardless of what different paths they take or what misunderstandings threaten to break them apart . . . until the fateful day when an act of kindness becomes an unforgivable betrayal.Now, years later, while trying to recapture the trust they've lost, Lilly and Val reunite once more—only to uncover a shocking secret. Will it destroy their friendship, or bring them ever closer?   Read more Read less",4 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Entrenched in the city's history, but also fresh enough to contribute to Nashville's exploding national popularity as a creative urban scene, Hot Chicken is an addiction and a sweet, spicy salvation to those who've had it. In The Hot Chicken Cookbook, Timothy Davis, a chef, writer, and Nashville resident, traces the dish's origins back to the late 1930's at Prince's Hot Chicken Shack, a story of love gone wrong, and follows the trail to its white-hot buzz of today. For more perspective on devotion, he visits the Nashville Hot Chicken Festival and talks chicken with The Che''s Carla Hall, Food Network personality Andrew Zimmern, Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan, writer of ""Return to Hot Chicken"", Joe Kwan of the Avett Brothers, and other culinary luminaries like Edward Lee, Linton Hopkins, Sarah Gavigan, Steven Satterfield, and Hugh Acheson. Featuring over two-dozen recipes from the finest Hot Chicken restaurants in Nashville and beyond, The Hot Chicken Cookbook tells the tale of Music City's fiery bird going global to influence a world of chefs and eaters.

In the case of a family's or group's recipes, the written instructions evoke images of celebrations, of family members and friends, of menus and kitchen conversations.

In The Keepsake Cookbook, cookbook author and storyteller Belinda Hulin provides easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions for collecting both oral and written recipes, as well as photographs and memorabilia-and then for organizing a cookbook and putting it into a format to be used and shared. In addition, Hulin gives advice on capturing family or group history, gently interviewing relatives and friends, and tapping your own memories in order to enrich the end product. She even includes basic recipe times, tips, and measures to help writers turn casual instructions into fully realized recipes. ""--  ""Creating a Keepsake Cookbook is a step-by-step, easy to follow guide on how to make your own family memoir cookbook. Belinda Hulin takes you through the journey of collecting family recipes (both oral and written), collecting photographs and memorabilia, and how to organize your cookbook in a format that is usable and can be easily shared. She also informs the reader about how to capture family history, interview friends and family, and how to relinquish you own memories in order to create the best family cookbook you possibly can.

"Distillation Control, Optimization, and Tuning : Fundamentals and Strategies",Lanny Robbins,chemistry,First published in 2011,/works/OL23501351W,/authors/OL7005994A/Lanny_Robbins,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2011|Publisher  Taylor & Francis|Pages 144,"Emphasis on improved quality and performance of distilled products and the demand for reduced operating costs place a heavy burden on both the personnel responsible for profitability and the manufacturing department charged with operating the processing equipment. There have been dramatic improvements in the computer software and hardware used to simulate and model the distillation process and potential response to experimentation, but mastering the art of distillation process and control still requires solid understanding of a large body of information. With a focus on achieving product purity at low cost, Distillation Control, Optimization, and Tuning: Fundamentals and Strategies highlights core concepts. These include process variables for continuous binary distillation columns and the four basic control strategies, the distillate and bottoms product quality performance objectives, and the tuning of process control loops. Without dwelling on complex mathematical descriptions, the book presents the fundamentals of process control of a distillation column as a separation and purification unit operation. It covers the concepts and functional criteria that are critical to successful implementation of process control, as well as measurement and improvement of product quality performance. It describes how process control loops for distillation columns can be tuned for stable operation, with a balance between minimum variability from setpoint changes and excellent response to load disturbances. Designed for students, engineers, technicians, and plant operators alike, this book emphasizes the prevailing need to strike a balance between the details of hypotheses and good engineering judgment. The author outlines learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter and includes chapter-end summaries, exercises, and references to help readers acquire essential knowledge and understanding. The result is a resource that will inform future decisions for the design, operation, and troubleshooting of distillation process control systems.

It gives an integrated literature cover up to late summer 1986; an innovative feature is the citation of all literature published subsequently up to a few weeks before publication in a late reference list. The data were treated critically and, where possible, organized into tables. Most of the figures are new. In places new interpretations are presented. Important new aspects are treated extensively. These include the results of high-resolution TEM studies of modulated structures and microstructures, high-precision determination of trace elements in the ppm and ppb ranges, new dynamic experiments on diffusion in and on growth, dissolution and zoning of feldspars. Volume 1 is a completely rewritten condensation of volumes 1 and 2 of the first edition, but for convenience the same chapter headings were retained. It is important to note that Volume 2 (in preparation), which covers thermodynamics, phase relationships and parageneses, is completely new. It contains those chapters which were planned for the never printed Volume 3 of the first edition.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The principal equations of nonlinear physics are also encountered (Sine Gordon equation, nonlinear Schrödinger equation), and their soliton solutions examined and related to nonlinear optics. The final chapter addresses the chaotic response of nonlinear systems. The book will appeal to graduate students in physics, physical chemistry and electronic engineering. The major topics include principles of the linear and nonlinear dielectronic response of matter, second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, and the inelastic scattering of light from matter, with attention also given to stimulated scattering. The highly nonlinear response of nearly resonant two-level systems is discussed, also in relation to saturation and self-induced transparency. Guided waves in optical fibers are explored, including the propagation of solition pulses. The nonlinear optical response of periodic structures is examined as well. This book is addressed to a broad audience interested in a thorough discussion of basic concepts. It facilitates access to the research literature, and will prepare the reader to tackle more advanced texts.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Often difficult to measure accurately and to deal with effectively, these compounds feature more and more prominently in courses on environmental toxicology and environmental sciences.This much needed book is a companion to the highly praised Principles of Ecotoxicology. It covers organic pollutants in greater depth and detail than has been covered in a textbook before.The first part covers issues such as:· chemical warfare· metababolism of pollutants in animals and plants· environmental fate, and effects within ecosystemsThis is followed by discussion of particular pollutants such as:· organochloride insecticides· PCBs· dioxins· organometallic compounds· polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons· anticoagulant rodenticidesamongst others. The book concludes with coverage of ecotoxicity testing, biomarkers and bioassays and future prospects for improved assessment of the dangers these compounds pose.It breaks new ground in offering a concise source of information on these compounds at a level suitable for senior undergraduates and postgraduates. Professionals working within the fields of environmental toxicology and environmental science will also find it a valuable reference.

The Eiffel Tower and our blood? the street lamps that guide us home AND The salt on our food? The answers are calcium, iron and sodium - each one an element. Forged in the Big Bang and in supernovas, the elements and their resulting compounds went on to create our Solar System, the planet we live on, the air we breathe, the water we rely on, and the proteins that would become life. This book provides need-to-know information on every one of the 118 known elements. Some, like carbon, oxygen and aluminium, are familiar; others, like gadolinium and tellurium, are not. Inside the book, you will find the elements' vital statistics, their important compounds and applications and the fascinating histories of their discovery. You will also find clear and concise explanations of what an element is, how and why the elements are arranged in the periodic table, and of the structure of atoms, the building blocks of everything around you.The Intriguing Story of the Elements is your definitive illustrated guide to the elements.

The intriguing dependence of the Monarch butterfly on its host plants is chosen as an example of plant-animal coevolution in action. The ability to isolate trace amounts of a substance from plant tissues has led to a wealth of new research, and the fourth edition of this well-known text has consequently been extensively revised. New sections have been provided on the cost of chemical defence and on the release of predator-attracting volatiles from plants. New information has been included on cyanogenesis, the protective role of tannins in plants and the phenomenon of induced defence in plant leaves following herbivory. Advanced level students and research workers alike will find much of value in this comprehensive text, written by an acknowledged expert on this fascinating subject.

Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples presents the most effective techniques for analyzing pesticide residues and other chemical contaminants in foods as well as in soil, water, and air. Renowned Scientists Report New Data and Advances in the Field The book introduces sample preparation, extraction, and analytical methods specific to each sample type, including foods from vegetal and animal origin. Other chapters discuss important aspects of quality assurance and the applicability of hyphenated analytical techniques. In addition to a practical chapter on the use of biosensors and immunoassays for monitoring and gathering exposure data, the book addresses regulatory aspects and presents current data on the levels of pesticides found in food and environmental matrices.  Latest Methods Help Scientists Develop Safer, More Effective Pesticides Analysis of Pesticides in Food and Environmental Samples enables scientists to measure and predict the behavior and toxicity of pesticides with a higher degree of accuracy. The methodologies and insight in this timely work will contribute to the development of more effective, less toxic pesticides as well as better safety regulations.

The Workshop brought together leading experts in theoretical chemistry and molecular physics with an interest in the quantum mechanical many-body problem. This volume provides an insight into the latest research in this increasingly important field. Throughout the Workshop, the emphasis was on innovative theory and conceptual developments rather than on computational implementation. The various contributions presented reflect this emphasis and embrace topics such as density matrices and density functional theory, relativistic formulations, electron correlation, valence theory, nuclear motion, response theory, condensed matter, and chemical reactions. Audience: The volume will be of interest to those working in the molecular sciences and to theoretical chemists and molecular physicists in particular.

Explicitly correlated wave functions are functions that depend explicitly on interelectronic distance. The book covers a wide range of methods based on explicitly correlated functions written by leaders in the field, including Kutzelnigg, Jeziorski, Szalewicz, Klopper and Noga. The book begins with a chapter on the theory of electron correlation and then the following three chapters describe different types of functions that can be used to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation for atoms and molecules. The book goes on to discuss the effects that go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, theory of relativistic effects, solution of the Dirac-Colomb equation, and relativistic correction using ECG functions. The last part of the book reviews applications of EC functions to calculate atomic and molecular properties and to study positronic systems, resonance states of atoms and nuclear dynamics of the hydrogen molecular ion.

Part 2 addresses the biochemical aspects of these two elements, and the various medical and environmental applications. (Part 1 presents a comparative study of the physical and chemical properties of scandium and yttrium, looking at both their similarities and their differences.) While these elements are relatively rare in nature, these books will show that they have unusual physical and chemical properties, and a disproportionate number of important applications.  Improved analytical techniques have revealed that scandium and yttrium are present throughout living matter, even though only a relatively limited number of species have been analyzed so far. This fact of course has far-ranging implications for biological and environmental concerns.  The major impacts of scandium and yttrium in science, technology, and medicine will be of interest to a wide variety of researchers, including geochemists, inorganic and organic chemists, clinical biochemists, and those specializing in environmental protection.

However, recent research has led to the discovery of other, less common nanoforms, which often serve as building blocks for more complex structures. This book covers these structures and outlines their potential use in many current and future applications, in particular as functional blocks in electronics, batteries, catalysis, ultrahigh density data storage, and drug delivery. The text first discusses the methods used to produce nanostructures and then presents examples of various nanostructures. Describes various nanostructures that are little known in the scientific world. Offers a unifying vision of the synthesis of nanostructures and the generalization of rare nanoforms. Discusses current and future applications. Includes a CD-ROM with color versions of more than 100 nanostructures""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Although the first attempts for preserving material cultural heritage on a scientific basis are found in the 19th century pioneer chemistry years, only the use of sophisticated physicochemical techniques results in effective identification and deterioration studies of monuments and objects, and in reliable intervention procedures. This volume allows gaining solid knowledge and improved skills on the ways separation schemes and diagnostic methodologies are applied in the safeguarding and authentication of tangible works of art; as well as on the modes of implementing novel preservation practices built on well-established principles – such as the use of laser in the decontamination of objects. All techniques are covered at a state-of-the-art level; while selected applications permit addressing major groups of materials and artefacts. Conservation Science is nowadays taught at master’s level in all developed countries, and museum laboratories increasingly adopt scientific approaches in their restoration initiatives. The book is intended as a valuable tool for students and professionals active in these frames. In addition; it provides an indispensable manual for participants in the specialized intensive courses, which are systematically offered by the authors under the auspices of the relevant European network.

True expertise in any field is a years-long endeavor. Here I will survey some of the basic topics of chemistry. This survey should give you enough knowledge to appreciate the impact of chemistry in everyday life and, if necessary, prepare you for additional instruction in chemistry. Throughout each chapter, I present two features that reinforce the theme of the textbook—that chemistry is all around you. The first is a feature titled, appropriately, “Chemistry Is Everywhere.” Chemistry Is Everywhere” focuses on the personal hygiene products that you may use every morning: toothpaste, soap, and shampoo, among others. These products are chemicals, aren’t they? Ever wonder about the chemical reactions that they undergo to give you clean and healthy teeth or shiny hair? I will explore some of these chemical reactions in future chapters. But this feature makes it clear that chemistry is, indeed, everywhere. The other feature focuses on chemistry that you likely indulge in every day: eating and drinking. In the “Food and Drink App,” I discuss how the chemistry of the chapter applies to things that you eat and drink every day. Carbonated beverages depend on the behavior of gases, foods contain acids and bases, and we actually eat certain rocks. (Can you guess which rocks without looking ahead?) Cooking, eating, drinking, and metabolism—we are involved with all these chemical processes all the time. These two features allow us to see the things we interact with every day in a new light—as chemistry. The goal of this textbook is not to make you an expert. True expertise in any field is a years-long endeavor. Here I will survey some of the basic topics of chemistry. This survey should give you enough knowledge to appreciate the impact of chemistry in everyday life and, if necessary, prepare you for additional instruction in chemistry.

They play a key role in determining the properties of materials, especially when grain size decreases and even more so with the current improvements of  processing tools and methods that allow us to control various elements in a polycrystal. This book presents the theoretical basis of the study of  grain boundaries and aims to open up new lines of research in this area. The treatment is light on mathematical approaches while emphasizing practical examples; the issues they raise are discussed with reference to theories. The general approach of the book has two main goals: to lead the reader from the concept of ‘ideal’ to ‘real’ grain boundaries; to depart from established knowledge and address the opportunities emerging through ""grain boundary engineering"",  the control of morphological and crystallographic features that affect material properties.^ The book is divided in three parts: I ‘From interganular order to disorder’ deals with the concept of the perfect grain boundary, at equilibrium, and questions the maintenance of its crystalline state. II ‘From the ideal to the real grain boundary’ deals with the concept of the faulted grain boundary. It attempts to reveal the influence of the grain boundary structure on its defects, their formation and their accommodation. III ‘From free to constrained grain boundaries’ is devoted to grain boundary ensembles starting from the triple junction (the elemental configuration) to real grain boundary networks in polycrystalsThis part covers a new and topical development in the field.^ It presents for the first time an avenue for researchers working on macroscopic aspects, to approach the scale of description of grain boundaries.Audience: graduate students, researchers and  engineers in Materials Science and all those scientists pursuing grain boundary engineering in order to improve materials performance.

How about your own firecrackers, dynamite, and ""medicinal"" opium wine? This fascinating book, reprinted from the 1930s, takes the reader back to a time when Americans had free access to hard drugs; people were responsible enough to be given recipes for poisons, explosives, and highly addictive substances; and making such items as soap, disinfectants, and insecticides was commonplace. A useful piece of publishing, books such as this were seen in most homes next to the almanac, as important as ice coolers and canning equipment. Two Thousand Formulas, Recipes, and Trade Secrets provides instructions for making adhesives, paints and inks, garden elixirs such as insecticides and weed killers, lubricants, photo developers, polishes, and much more.

Some are synthetic while many others are products of nature. Molecules That Amaze Us presents the stories behind many of the most famous and infamous molecules that make up our modern world. Examples include the molecule responsible for the spicy heat in chilies (capsaicin), the world's first synthetic painkiller (aspirin), the pigment responsible for the color of autumn leaves (carotene), the explosive in dynamite (nitroglycerine), the antimalarial drug (quinine), the drug known as ""speed"" (methamphetamine), and many others. Other molecules discussed include caffeine, adrenaline, cholesterol, cocaine, digitalis, dopamine, glucose, insulin, methane, nicotine, oxytocin, penicillin, carbon dioxide, limonene, and testosterone. In all, the book includes 67 sections, each describing a different molecule, what it does, how it is made, and why it is so interesting.Written by experts in the field, the book is accessible and easy to read. It includes amusing anecdotes, historical curiosities, and entertaining facts about each molecule, thereby balancing educational content with entertainment. The book is heavily illustrated with relevant photographs, images, and cartoons--the aim being both to educate and entertain. ""--  ""In the mid 1990s, soon after the World Wide Web became a reality, several chemists decided that Molecule of the Month websites would be a good way of disseminating information about interesting molecules in an accessible way. One of these websites, based at Bristol University in the UK, was set up in 1996 by one of the authors (PWM) and administered by him ever since - making it one of the longest running chemistry websites on the web! Over the years, the other author (SAC) contributed over 50 articles for the site, and it has now become a valuable chemistry resource for schools, colleges, or the interested layperson alike. At a time when more teaching materials are produced in an electronic format, the reader may wonder why the authors have bucked the trend, essentially proceeding in the reverse direction and turning electronic articles into a hardcopy book. Well, words in print still have life in them, and some readers do prefer to have a book in their hands. It also cannot be denied that there is a feel- good factor in seeing the articles in a more permanent form. Some of these articles have appeared on the Bristol MOT M site before, but all have been updated for these pages, and many are brand-new. We hope that they appeal to a wide readership; the chemistry is meant to be intelligible to a high-school student, but the stories that lie behind the molecules can appeal to any interested person. Chemicals are morally neutral; they can be put to either good or bad uses. We have tried to be light-hearted in our approach to the subject matter, but rest assured, every fact stated here is believed by the authors to be utterly true""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It discusses many widely used solid state materials, including high-temperature oxide superconductors, diamond films, catalysts, semiconductors, and magnetic materials. The introductory tutorial section familiarizes the reader with basic elements of crystallography; the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of solids; and phase diagrams. The tutorials use physics and mathematics at levels that any 3rd year chemistry student should be able to follow with little difficulty. The chapters that follow treat the synthesis of oxides and sulfides as both polycrystalline solids and simple crystals. Compounds selected for discussion are classified according to structure type, which are illustrated by clear drawings. Throughout, the focus is on how synthesis is related to properties and how sensitive properties are to small levels of contaminants. The book uses a single extended molecular orbital model to correlate properties with synthesis and structure. Solid State Chemistry is suitable for use as a text for a short 3rd year course in chemistry or materials science. Each chapter includes problems (some with answers) that test the students ability to apply the principles discussed and encourage further reading in the literature.

Second quantization is an alternative tool for dealing with many-electron theory. The vast majority of quantum chemical problems are more easily treated using second quantization as a language. This book offers a simple and pedagogical presentation of the theory and some applications. The reader is not supposed to be trained in higher mathematics, though familiarity with elementary quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry is assumed. Besides the basic formalism and standard illustrative applications, some recent topics of quantum chemistry are reviewed in some detail. This book bridges the gap between sophisticated quantum theory and practical quantum chemistry.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In each section, an important skill is developed or fine-tuned. Multiple problems are then provided in order to build competence in that skill. Students are given the opportunity to master each core skill before moving on to the next section.  The end-of-chapter exercises integrate the skills developed throughout the chapter.  Three short chapters (Chapters 7, 12, and 24) are devoted entirely to skill development (proposing mechanisms and proposing syntheses).  WileyPLUS incorporates hundreds of end of chapter problems all of which are available with multiple forms of problem solving support (link to text, tutorials, videos, etc.).

Its foundations consist of understanding chemical phenomena in terms of the most fundamental laws of physics. This book focuses on the concepts on which this science is founded rather than on the applications. The subject is presented starting from the main ideas of physics (classical, quantum and statistical) relevant to the description of phenomena of interest from the chemical point of view. The authors have taken an individual approach in their presentation of the essence of a connected theory rather than mere explanations of apparently unrelated facts. Audience: The book will be useful to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in fields such as chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering and biology, where there is a need for a knowledge of chemistry which includes, beside the presentation of facts, their explanation in terms of general principles.

Chapter III presents the main results obtained so far in describing non-linear effects in the elastic field of straight dislocations, as well as in the study of the core configuration of dislocations by using semidiscrete methods. Chapter IV is devoted to the linear and non-linear theory of continuous distri­ butions of dislocations and to its application to investigating the influence of dislo­ cations on crystal density and on the low-temperature thermal conductivity of crystals. Chapter V deals with the modelling of point defects as rigid or elastic inclusions l in an elastic matrix, or as force !nultipoles. Finally, some of the results Q)ailable on the interactions between point defects and other crystal defects are briefly reviewed. Although the material in the text covers mainly the mathematical theory of crystal defects, the author has been constantly concerned with emphasizing the phYSical significance of the results and some of their possible applications. The reader can easily enlarge his information in these directions by reference to the stan­ dard books on crystal defects by Cottrell {84J, Read {275J, Friedel [124J, Kroner [190J, van Bueren {365J, Indenbom {167J, Nabarro {258J, Hirth and Lathe [162J, or to the review articles by Seeger [286 J, Eshelby {Ill J, de Wit [385 J, and Bullough [50].

Many recent advances in such diverse fields as immunology, cellular biology and materials science have been achieved through the synthetic chemist's ability to construct often very complicated structures in one enantiomeric form.Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products, 2nd Edition introduces students to this rapidly growing field of organic chemistry. The initial chapters present the foundations of asymmetric synthesis, including the theory and applications of individual asymmetric reactions. This is followed by chapters on each of the major individual classes of natural products; their structures, biosynthesis and interrelationships as well as examples of asymmetric syntheses and the practical value of these compounds. Natural product classes covered include carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides, proteins, nucleosides, nucleotides, nucleic acids, polyketides, isoprenoids, shikamic acid derivatives and alkaloids.For this second edition the text has been thoroughly updated and expanded, and includes new discussions and examples covering atom and redox economies, practical aspects and environmental awareness. Organocatalysis has emerged completely in the last ten years, and has been fully integrated into this new edition.Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products, 2nd Edition will find a place on the bookshelves of advanced undergraduates and postgraduates working in natural products chemistry, organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.

While traditional chemistry focuses on the bonds that hold atoms together in a molecule, supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker interactions that hold groups of molecules together. Important concepts that have been demonstrated by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self-assembly, folding, molecular recognition, host-guest chemistry, mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures, and dynamic covalent chemistry.The importance of supramolecular chemistry was established by the 1987 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, which was awarded to Donald J. Cram, Jean-Marie Lehn, and Charles J. Pedersen in recognition of their work in the field.The past decade has seen dramatic developments in the field, with supramolecular chemistry leaving its roots in classical host guest chemistry and expanding into exciting areas of materials chemistry and nanoscience with many real and potential applications. Supramolecular findings are evolving our understanding of the way chemical concepts at the molecular level build up into materials and systems with fascinating, emergent properties on the nanoscale. Supramolecular chemistry: the biggest challenge yet!""Creating that link between the chemist's understanding of the way in which molecules interact with one another, and the understanding a materials scientist, engineer or biologist has of the resulting properties of a material or system comprised of those molecules is one of the huge grand challenges facing modern molecular science."" --Philip A. Gale and Jonathan W. Steed, Editors-in-ChiefLinking supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology to define the field in the 21st Century...Supramolecular Chemistry: From Molecules to Nanomaterials is the first major reference to link supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology. A global team of experts present an overview of the concepts and techniques of modern supramolecular chemistry, demonstrating how these paradigms evolve into nanoscale systems chemistry, nanotechnology, materials science and beyond.Breaking down the barriers between synthetic chemistry and materials science, the authors demonstrate how modern techniques allow access increasingly far along the 'synthesising-up' pathway. Supramolecular Chemistry: From Molecules to Nanomaterials explains the fundamental concepts and provides invaluable practical guidance on the applications and limitations of modern instrumental techniques for addressing molecular and materials-based problems.The printed edition of Supramolecular Chemistry: From Molecules to Nanomaterials is available as an eight-volume set. Publishing in full colour to enhance the interpretation of complex supramolecular structures the printed edition  is highly illustrated with an average of three images per page features fully indexed articles with cross-references integrated into the text includes a glossary of key terms Introductory Offer!

During the phototransformation not only the absorption spectra but also various physicochemical properties change, such as the refractive index, dielectric constant, oxidation/reduction potential, and geometrical structure. The property changes can be applied to photonic equipment such as erasable memory media, photo-optical switch components, and display devices. This book compiles the accomplishments of the research project titled “New Frontiers in Photochromism” supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. The project focused not only on the above-mentioned classical subjects in photochromism, such as color changes, optical memory, and optical switches, but also on fundamental physicochemical studies and unprecedented application fields that have not yet been explored in photochromism. The latter topics include light-driven mechanical motion, photocontrol of surface wettability, metal deposition on solid materials, photocontrol of chiral properties, ultrafast decoloration dyes, and femtosecond laser experiments, among others.

Water quality monitoring is a fundamental tool in the management of freshwater resources, and this book covers the entire monitoring process providing detailed guidance for implementing a monitoring network with step-by-step descriptions of field and laboratory methods. This essential work, which will be particularly relevant for field use in developing countries, provides: a general protocol for the design and implementation of a monitoring programme in surface and groundwaters; details of sampling and analytical methods; guidance on data analysis and presentation.This book provides a sound basis for designing and implementing water quality monitoring programmes and studies of the impact of human activities on water bodies. It brings together information on proven methods and thus will be useful for anyone concerned with water quality monitoring with a scientific, managerial or engineering background, including field staff. An overview of the prinicples underlying hydrological, chemical, biological and sediment measurements together with their importance and relevance to water quality monitoring is also included.This important text is the outcome of a collaborative programmne of activity between UNEP and WHO, with inputs from WHO and UNESCO, and draws on the international statndards of the International Organization for Standardization. It has been comprehensively field tested in deveolping countries and reflects the experience resulting from those tests.Water Quality Monitoring is a companion volume to Water Quality Assessments edited by Deborah Chapman.

This book provides a comprehensive review of single molecule manipulation with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The text demonstrates that AFMs are capable of meeting the three main challenges in molecular manufacturing: manipulating and positioning each atom or molecule in the right place, making the atom or molecule form certain bonds, and achieving high-throughput fabrication. New and experienced researchers will find a wealth of information in this informative volume which demonstrates the potential of AFMs beyond imaging""--  ""Scientists have long dreamed of working with single atoms and molecules. In 1952, Erwin Schrd̲inger wrote that we never experiment with just one electron or atom or molecule. With the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in the early 1980s, that dream has become a reality. STM was capable of ""seeing"" atoms and molecules and, furthermore, of manipulating them individually, as demonstrated a few years later. Scientists can now play with single atoms, single molecules, and even single bonds""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

To this end, methods are presented for the design of advanced fault-tolerant control systems for chemical processes which explicitly deal with actuator/controller failures and sensor faults and data losses. Specifically, the book puts forward: ·         a framework for  detection, isolation and diagnosis of actuator and sensor faults for nonlinear systems;·         controller reconfiguration and safe-parking-based fault-handling methodologies;·         integrated-data- and model-based fault-detection and isolation and fault-tolerant control methods;·         methods for handling sensor faults and data losses; and·         methods for monitoring the performance of low-level PID loops.The methodologies proposed employ nonlinear systems analysis, Lyapunov techniques, optimization, statistical methods and hybrid systems theory and are predicated upon the idea of integrating fault-detection, local feedback control, and supervisory control. The applicability and performance of the methods are demonstrated through a number of chemical process examples.Fault-Tolerant Process Control is a valuable resource for academic researchers, industrial practitioners as well as graduate students pursuing research in this area.

Emphasis is on the progress made in the developments in EPR technology, in the application of sophisticated matrix isolation techniques and in the advancement in quantitative EPR that have occurred since the 1st edition was published. Improvements have been made also at theoretical level, with the development of methods based on first principles and their application to the calculation of magnetic properties as well as in spectral simulations. EPR of Free Radicals in Solids II focuses on the trends in applications of experimental and theoretical methods to extract structural and dynamical properties of radicals and spin probes in solid matrices by continuous wave (CW) and pulsed techniques in nine chapters written by experts in the field. It examines the studies involving radiation- and photo-induced inorganic and organic radicals in inert matrices, the high-spin molecules and metal-based molecular clusters as well as the radical pro-cesses in photosynthesis. Recent advancements in environmental applications in-cluding measurements by myon resonance of radicals on surfaces and by quantitative EPR in dosimetry are outlined and the applications of optical detection in material research with much increased sensitivity reviewed. The potential use of EPR in quantum computing is considered in a newly written chapter. This new edition is aimed to experimentalists and theoreticians in research involving free radicals, as well as for students of advanced courses in physical chemis-try, chemical physics, materials science, biophysics, biochemistry and related fields.

La carencia de informacion por parte de las empresas y las autoridades, y la falta de un debate interdisciplinario, capaz de arrojar luz sobre un tema ampliamente batallado a lo largo del globo, ha sumido a muchos en la ignorancia, la indiferencia o en la adopcion de actitudes basadas en criterios ajenos y no propios.Enriquecido con el aporte que brindan las opiniones de once entrevistados expertos en el tema y recogiendo una investigacion periodistica desde distintos enfoques, este libro pretende “abrir caminos” entre la compleja marana de posiciones encontradas, avanzando un poco mas alla de la tradicional postura “transgenicos si-transgenicos no” y llegando al publico como un vehiculo de difusion y concientizacion.

The enterprise proved successful resulting in high-level reviews written by well-known scientists appearing in the Journal. The reviews represent emerging and rapidly growing fields of research in fundamental as well as applied areas of biochemistry, such as medicine, biotechnology, agriculture and nutrition. Novel methodological andtechnological approaches which stimulate biochemical research are also included. The authors of the reviews are explicitly asked to be critical, selective, evaluative and interdisciplinarily oriented. The reviews should encourage young scientists toward independent and creative thinking, and inform active investigators about the state of the art in a given field.

Papers in this volume describe how all of these challenges have been met for particular examples within a number of common combustion scenarios: reactive shocks, low mach number premixed reactive flow, nonpremixed phenomena, and solid propellants. The types of phenomena they examine are also diverse: properties of interfaces and shocks, including curvature effects, the stability and other properties of steady structures, the long time dynamics of evolving solutions, and spatio-temporal patterns. These issues are foremost in combustion research; the papers collected here provide a good representative sampling of contemporary activity in this field.

Electrostatic precipitation is a highly efficient method of removing entrained particulate contaminants from exhaust gases and is extensively used in these industries to limit particulate emissions. New legislation aimed at improving the environment by further limiting these discharges has resulted in the technique undergoing considerable development over the past decade, to the point where it has become the method of choice, over a wide range of applications, for limiting particulate discharges. In this new book, the editor has brought together an international team of contributors, mainly industrialists and consultants, to produce an authorative and practical guide to electrostatic precipitation. This book is of interest to all those in process industries or power generation and to academics concerned with gas cleaning and environmental issues.

Such data might arise in business and economics, engineering, geophysical sciences, agriculture, and many other fields. The emphasis is on providing an account of the basic concepts and methods which are useful in analyzing such data, and includes a wide variety of examples drawn from many fields of application. The book presupposes a familiarity with univariate time series as might be gained from one semester of a graduate course, but it is otherwise self-contained. It covers the basic topics such as autocovariance matrices of stationary processes, vector ARMA models and their properties, forecasting ARMA processes, least squares and maximum likelihood estimation techniques for vector AR and ARMA models. In addition, it presents some more advanced topics and techniques including reduced rank structure, structural indices, scalar component models, canonical correlation analyses for vector time series, multivariate nonstationary unit root models and co-integration structure and state-space models and Kalman filtering techniques.

Most companies that ship or receive goods internationally have developed MCS that address regulatory requirements; however, these typically are labor intensive, independent of other company systems, adequately address only their primary location, and are not updated in a timely manner. Supply chain logistics is complicated, and this book details how to avoid security holds on shipments and gives sound advice on how to cope if another ""9/11"" occurs. The book provides easy to understand guidance to shipping/receiving personnel, safety inspectors, transportation and logistics managers on the movement of hazardous cargo from one location to another ensuring compliance to the maze of regulatory requirements.

Such inhomogeneities are deleterious for the performance of the devices produced from these crystals. This book gives a review of the various origins of inhomogeneities occuring during crystal growth. It is shown that convection is the major source of the non-uniformities in the technically used growth configurations, e.g. Czochralski-, zone- and Bridgman-methods, because the growth rate is controlled by the heat transport. The formalism of hydrodynamics, especially dimensionless numbers, is used for a modeling of melt growth, giving a correlation between the occurrence of inhomogeneities and relevant growth parameters. The results of the theoretical and experimental modeling are found to correlate with results of real crystal growth, especially for cases of dominating buoyancy convection. Various measures in avoiding inhomogeneities are derived from the models and are discussed with respect to their efficiency and practical applicability.

Each problem is accompanied by a detailed step-by-step solution, organized as strategy, assumptions, approximations, numerical calculation and interpretation. Solutions to the key problems (e.g. thermal equilibration, ligand-receptor interaction, aminoacid zwitterions, HOMO-LUMO gap) are accompanied by simple introductory explanations. In addition, informal notes are provided on difficult concepts, for example: entropy, reaction activation barrier, wave mechanics. Schemes, diagrams and structural formulas accompany most solutions and explanations. Thus, this textbook may serve as a self-tutorial for undergraduate students in physical chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.""--Pub. desc.

Beyond colloid science, the system also serves as a model for studying interactions in biological matter. This work quantitatively investigated the scaling laws of the characteristic lengths of the structuring of colloidal dispersions and tested the generality of these laws, thereby explaining and resolving some long-standing contradictions in the literature. It revealed the effect of confinement on the structuring, independently of specific properties of the confining interfaces. In addition, it resolved the influence of roughness and charge of the confining interfaces on the structuring, as well as providing a method to measure the effect of surface deformability on colloidal structuring.

There is an enormous world-wide effort both in basic scientific research as well as in industrial development in the area of organic electronics. It is becoming increasingly clear that, if devices based on organic materials are ever going to have a significant relevance beyond being a cheap replacement for inorganic semiconductors, there will be a need to understand interface formation, film growth and functionality. A control of these aspects will allow the realisation of totally new device concepts exploiting the enormous flexibility inherent in organic chemistry. In this book we focus on oligomeric/molecular films as we believe that the control of molecular structures and interfaces provides highly defined systems which allow, on the one hand the study of the basic physics and on the other hand to find the important parameters necessary to improve organic devices.

This book discusses the structure if the self-trapped exciton (STE) and its evolution along the path of its return to the ground state or to a defect state of crytal. A comprehensive review of experiments on STEs in a wide range of materials has been assembled, including extensive tables of data. Throughout, emphasisis given to the basic physics underlying various manifestations of self-trapping. The role of the spontaneous symmetry-breaking or ""off-center""relaxation in STE structure is examined thoroughly, and leads naturally to the subject of lattice defect formation as a product of STE relaxation. The theory of STEs is developed from a localized, atomistic perspective using self-consistent methods adapted from the theory of defects in solids. At this time of rapid progress in STEs, researchers will welcome the first monograph dedicaded solely to this topic.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

These are systems too large to be analyzed by the methods of particle dynamics, but too small to treated by the standard statistical techniques. The goal is to analyze the properties of such finite aggregates and their behavior in gases and plasmas, and to investigate processes that involve such clusters. The presentation is based on lectures and seminar problems for graduate students; the main part of the book thus includes more than 200 problems, each of them illustrating a specific aspect of finite systems of bound atoms and their behavior in gases and plasmas. Topics covered include: collisions, charge transfer, chemical reactions, condensed systems and their structures, kinetics of cluster growth, excited clusters, the transition from clusters to bulk particles, and small particles, dust, and aerosols in plasmas. Some reference data for corresponding parameters of systems under consideration are given in the problems and in the appendices. The book will be of interest to physicists, astrophysicists, and chemists.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ordered packings of nanoscale particles can exhibit unusual properties. This work investigates the self-assembly of such particles, a process widely employed for the generation of ordered structures, but not yet well understood. In situ methods are used to observe the assembly of sub-micron polymer lattices and sub-10 nm gold particles into crystalline monolayers and aggregates.On the basis of these results, the book develops new models that describe the competition between different influences, such as thermal agitation and directional forces. It suggests necessary criteria that lead to the emergence of order.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Baer,chemistry,First published in 2006,/works/OL5829437W?edition=ia%3Abeyondbornoppenh00baer,/authors/OL1428858A/M._Baer,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24246223M-M.jpg,"Publish Date 2006|Publisher  John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|Language English","INTRODUCING A POWERFUL APPROACH TO DEVELOPING RELIABLE QUANTUM MECHANICAL TREATMENTS OF A LARGE VARIETY OF PROCESSES IN MOLECULAR SYSTEMS.    The Born-Oppenheimer approximation has been fundamental to calculation in molecular spectroscopy and molecular dynamics since the early days of quantum mechanics. This is despite well-established fact that it is often not valid due to conical intersections that give rise to strong nonadiabatic effects caused by singular nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs). In Beyond Born-Oppenheimer, Michael Baer, a leading authority on molecular scattering theory and electronic nonadiabatic processes, addresses this deficiency and introduces a rigorous approach--diabatization--for eliminating troublesome NACTs and deriving well-converged equations to treat the interactions within and between molecules.    Concentrating on both the practical and theoretical aspects of electronic nonadiabatic transitions in molecules, Professor Baer uses a simple mathematical language to rigorously eliminate the singular NACTs and enable reliable calculations of spectroscopic and dynamical cross sections. He presents models of varying complexity to illustrate the validity of the theory and explores the significance of the study of NACTs and the relationship between molecular physics and other fields in physics, particularly electrodynamics.    The first book of its king Beyond Born-Oppenheimer:   Presents a detailed mathematical framework to treat electronic NACTs and their conical intersections   Describes the Born-Oppenheimer treatment, including the concepts of adiabatic and diabatic frameworks   Introduces a field-theoretical approach to calculating NACTs, which offers an alternative to time-consuming ab initio procedures   Discusses various approximations for treating a large system of diabatic Schr?dinger equations   Presents numerous exercises with solutions to further clarify the material being discussed    Beyond Born-Oppenheimer is required reading for physicists, physical chemists, and all researchers involved in the quantum mechanical study of molecular systems.

It is authored not only by Kevin Dunn but also four figments of his imagination who have leapt from mind to mind down through history and do their best to make the leap out of the book and into yours. You learn the history of chemical technology through a series of hands-on projects that demand that you get your hands dirty making things from scratch: fire, paper, glass, soap, batteries, photographs, polyester, and others. The book does not shy away from potentially dangerous projects like making gunpowder, alcohol, and chlorine gas, trusting that readers are capable of all due caution.

Despite the advantages of the widely used TiO2, the yield of the conversion of sun power into chemical energy that can be achieved with this material is limited prompting the research and development of  a number of structural, morphological and chemical modifications of TiO2 , as well as a number of novel photocatalysts with very different composition. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a systematic account of the current understanding  of the relationships between the physicochemical properties of the catalysts and photoactivity.   The already long list of photocatalysts phases and their modifications is increasing day by day. By approaching this field from a material sciences angle, an integrated view allows readers to consider the diversity of photocatalysts globally and in connection with other technologies. Design of Advanced Photocatalytic Materials for Energy and Environmental Applications provides a valuable road-map, outlining  the common principles lying behind the diversity of materials, but also delimiting the imprecise border between the contrasted results and the most speculative studies. This broad approach makes it ideal for specialist but also for engineers, researchers and students in related fields.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

As discussed in this book, nanometer-sized metal particles can be obtained not only by evaporation methods, producing atomic or molecular beams, but also by the chemical synthesis of metal cluster compounds. These have a well-defined stoichiometry and are composed of metal clusters of a given, homogeneous size, each cluster being surrounded by a shell of ligand molecules. Accordingly, the compounds provide excellent model systems for macroscopic assemblies of small metal particles embedded in a dielectric solid. The underlying physical properties are described in terms of a three-dimensional matrix of mutually separated quantum wells. In going from one compound to another, the size and separation of the quantum wells may be varied. In this way, one may study such fundamental properties as the size-induced transition from metallic to molecular behaviour. At the same time, the electronic level structure may be changed in a controlled way, which should confer tunable optical, electrical or magnetic properties. This book summarizes physical experiments performed so far on this challenging new class of materials, as well as the basic aspects of their chemical synthesis. For physicists, chemists and materials scientists with an interest in metal-cluster compounds and their physical properties.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The chapters of a more general character concern the use of the space group-subgroup relatioship for the recognition of structure families, the crystal chemical formulae (which is a way of denoting simple crystal chemical information in a condensed form), the concepts of atom coordination, atom volume and charge transfer and the physicist's view of the bond strength in the solid which is measured by the crystal orbital overleap population. It is demonstrated for the case of ionic compounds that the bond valence method is superior to the old sum-of-radii method for the prediction of interatomic distances. Simple valence electron rules can be applied to compounds with tetrahedral anion complexes. These rules allow one not only to make predictions on expected structural features of unknown compounds, but also to point out inconsistencies between the reported structure and composition of known comounds. Detailed accounts are presented on the crystal chemistry of the superconducting copper oxids, the sulfosalts, the metal cluster compounds, the silicates and the transition metal borides and related compounds. In the case of intermetallic compounds the intergrowth concept is found to be very useful for an `understanding' of complicated atom arrangements. At the end of each chapter there can be found problems and their solutions. This makes it possible for (advanced) undergraduates in chemistry, physics, metallurgy, materials science and mineralogy to be able to profit from a study of this book.

The difficulty in characterising and obtaining structural information on such large assemblies has increased to such a level that no single technique is now adequate. Various methods have now been upgraded and are being combined: X-ray diffraction (structures with hundreds of independent atoms), NMR, AFM/STM (manipulation of a single molecule), FAB/MS, time-resolved techniques up to the picosecond range, new computational approaches, and others. The present book sheds light on the most recent developments in both the synthesis of novel assemblies and on current methods for their characterisation.

One of the most useful concepts for this purpose is that of the random walk which has applications in many areas, particularly in statistical physics and statistical chemistry. Originally published in 1991, Intersections of Random Walks focuses on and explores a number of problems dealing primarily with the nonintersection of random walks and the self-avoiding walk. Many of these problems arise in studying statistical physics and other critical phenomena. Topics include: discrete harmonic measure, including an introduction to diffusion limited aggregation (DLA); the probability that independent random walks do not intersect; and properties of walks without self-intersections. The present softcover reprint includes corrections and addenda from the 1996 printing, and  makes this classic monograph available to a wider audience. With a self-contained introduction to the properties of simple random walks, and an emphasis on rigorous results, the book will be useful to researchers in probability and statistical physics and to graduate students interested in basic properties of random walks.

We present a detailed formalism of these methods that are based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics or algebraic correlations or principles of the artificial neural network. The book will serve as single complete reference to understand the theoretical derivations of thermodiffusion models and its application to different types of multi-component mixtures. An exhaustive discussion of these is used to give a complete perspective of the principles and the key factors that govern the thermodiffusion process.

The present book attempts to bridge these gaps, linking the properties of atoms, radicals, molecules, clusters, nano-particles, liquids, solutions, melts, glasses and crystalline solids. Geometrical structure is considered in its indissoluble unity with energetic properties and polarisability (and hence optical properties), using electronegativity as a unifying concept.Recent decades brought abundant and more precise structural measurements, as well as opening of whole new areas, e.g. non-classical crystals, high-pressure crystallography, real-time study of phase transitions, nanomaterials with their intricate size-effects, fullerenes and clusters, van der Waals molecules. The book gives an outline of these new developments, while showing that the old concepts and techniques, from atomic radii to refractometry, are still useful.Features:A survey of structural chemistry across different aggregate states (gas, liquid, glass, crystalline, nano-materials)Conceptual and numerical links between geometrical, thermodynamic, electronic and optical propertiesUp-to-date reference data, systematically presented and tabulatedCritically revised tables of standard parameters - bond distances and energies, atomic radii, equations of state, etc.   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On the one hand, it is nowadays possible to compute, to quite a reasonable degree of accuracy, almost all fundamental spectroscopic properties for small molecular systems. The theoretical approach is now properly considered to be of fundamental importance in attaining a high degree of understanding of spectroscopic information. Moreover, it may be also a great help in designing and planning experiments. On the other hand, new and very powerful experimental techniques have been developed. This book combines an advanced teaching standpoint with an emphasis on the interplay between theoretical and experimental molecular spectroscopy. It covers a wide range of topics (such as molecular dynamics and reactivity, conformational analysis, hydrogen bonding and solvent effects, spectroscopy of excited states, complex spectra interpretation and simulation, software development and biochemical applications of molecular spectroscopy) and considers a large variety of molecular spectroscopic techniques, either from an experimental or from a theoretical perspective.

It reviews the recent results of the employed analytical methods comprising all modern surface techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy and various kinds of electron spectroscopies. The present status of this new, clearly defined field of surface science is nearly completely overviewed by contributions from most of the research groups active in this field. The book is meant as a basis for the expected rapid development in this area with applications in catalysis, thin-film and semiconductor technology, sensors, electrochemistry, controlled preparation of ultrathin epitaxial surfaces, and interfaces of insultors as well as future molecular electronics.
