It also examined the impact of the kind of nursing home (religiously-affiliated or non-sectarian) on religiosity and adjustment.  A total of 60 nursing home residents (aged 65-108), 30 from religiously-affiliated homes and 30 from non-sectarian homes, took part in this study. Participants had to have resided in the nursing home $le$9 months, scored $ge$18 on the Mini-Mental State Exam and had no history of chronic depression by chart review. Examiners administered the Index of Religiosity (Zuckerman, Kasl, & Ostfeld, 1984), the Religious Orientation Scale-Revised (Gorsuch & Mc Pherson, 1989), the Geriatric Depression Scale (Brink, Yesavage, Lum, Heersma, Adley & Rose, 1982), and the Senior Apperception Technique (Bellak & Bellak, 1973).  Results revealed a highly religious population. Over 70% of the sample described themselves as ""deeply"" or ""fairly"" religious people who attend church/synagogue services on at least a bi-weekly basis. Although participants from religiously-affiliated homes scored significantly higher on three of the four measures of religiosity than did those from non-sectarian institutions, no difference was seen between the two kinds of homes for adjustment.  A multiple regression model revealed that intrinsic religious motivation was a significant predictor of better adjustment as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale. A significant negative correlation was found between personal religious orientation and depression on the same measure but the association was not strong enough to be predictive. No significant results were found for adjustment as measured by the Senior Apperception Technique.  These findings provide additional support for the generally positive relationship between religiosity and lower levels of depression in older persons still residing in the community. They also suggest that this relationship holds up even under the stress of decline and loss serious enough to necessitate admission to a nursing home.

This question motivates this collection of new essays from leading theologians, philosophers, and biblical scholars. Part I portrays Jesus in his first-century intellectual and historical context, attending to intellectual influences and contributions and contemporaneous similar patterns of thought. Part II examines how Jesus influenced two of the most prominent medieval philosophers. It considers the seeming conceptual shift from Hebraic categories of thought to distinctively Greco-Roman ones in later Christian philosophers. Part III considers the significance of Jesus for some prominent contemporary philosophical topics, including epistemology and the meaning of life. The focus is not so much on how 'Christianity' figures in such topics as on how Jesus makes distinctive contributions to them.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Hegels filosofie van de monotheïstische religies en anderzijds godsdienstwetenschappelijke inzichten in en vanuit de godsdiensten zelf. Het doel is te komen tot een wijsgerige verheldering van wat deze religies kenmerkt. Wat kan een filosofische benadering van de verschillende godsdiensten, zoals die van Hegel, bijdragen aan een beter begrip ervan? Hoe zou de godsdienstfilosofie een rol kunnen spelen in het actuele debat over religie, en de verhouding daarvan tot de grondslagen van recht en politiek? De manier waarop we over God denken en dus hoe we geloven, beïnvloedt onze moraal en ons recht, de wetten die we maken en de wijze waarop we die toepassen. Hegel had veel op met het christendom. In zijn ogen vormde het christelijk geloof ten opzichte van andere, eerdere godsdiensten een vervolmaking en een voltooiing van de religie. Filosofisch bezien is het christendom de religie van vrijheid en van verzoening van God en de mens met elkaar. Alle godsdiensten die voorafgingen aan het christendom, beschouwt hij als beperkter en eenzijdiger: de 'ware geest' is daarin nog onvoldoende ontwikkeld. Deze hoogst controversiële claim wordt in dit boek aan een nader, kritisch onderzoek onderworpen.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is translated by B. Alan Wallace, widely respected for his lucid and readable translations of Tibetan Buddhism. Dudjom Lingpa (1835-1904) was one of the foremost tantric masters of his time. Volume 1 contains four works explaining the view and practice of the Great Perfection, the signature style of meditation of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism: The Sharp Vajra of Conscious Awareness Tantra: This work is considered the root distillation of Dudjom Lingpa's wisdom. Essence of Clear Meaning: This definitive commentary, which unpacks the quintessential verses of The Sharp Vajra, is based on Dudjom Lingpa's oral teachings recorded by his disciple Pema Tashi. The Foolish Dharma of an Idiot Clothed in Mud and Feathers: Dudjom Lingpa narrates the essential Dharma teachings from the perspective of an old man rejecting superficial appearances. The Enlightened View of Samantabhadra: A masterful exposition of the Great Perfection is revealed as a dialogue between wisdom beings who bestow a treasury of pith instructions and specific advice for practitioners. While the teachings in this series have inspired generations of Tibetans, only one of the eight texts has been published in translation--until now""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Apart from an introductory article on Daoism (the prototypical autochthonous religion of China), the volume reflects China?s encounter with religions of the so-called Western Regions, starting from the adoption of Indian Buddhism to early settlements of religious minorities from the Near East (Islam, Christianity, and Judaism) and the early modern debates between Confucians and Christian missionaries. Contemporary religious minorities, their specific social problems, and their regional diversities are discussed in the cases of Abrahamitic traditions in China.

Something essential is missing from modern life. Many who've turned away from religious institutions-and others who have lived wholly without religion-hunger for more than what contemporary secular life has to offer but are reluctant to follow organized religion's strict and often inflexible path to spirituality. In A Religion of One's Own, bestselling author and former monk Thomas Moore explores the myriad possibilities of creating a personal spiritual style, either inside or outside formal religion. Two decades ago, Moore's Care of the Soul touched a chord with millions of readers yearning to integrate spirituality into their everyday lives. In A Religion of One's Own, Moore expands on the topics he first explored shortly after leaving the monastery. He recounts the benefits of contemplative living that he learned during his twelve years as a monk but also the more original and imaginative spirituality that he later developed and embraced in his secular life. Here, he shares stories of others who are creating their own path: a former football player now on a spiritual quest with the Pueblo Indians, a friend who makes a meditative practice of floral arrangements, and a well-known classical pianist whose audiences sometimes describe having a mystical experience while listening to her performances. Moore weaves their experiences with the wisdom of philosophers, writers, and artists who have rejected materialism and infused their secular lives with transcendence. At a time when so many feel disillusioned with or detached from organized religion yet long for a way to move beyond an exclusively materialistic, rational lifestyle, A Religion of One's Own points the way to creating an amplified inner life and a world of greater purpose, meaning, and reflection.

Saving the people,Nadia Marzouki,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL20042549W,/authors/OL7354044A/Nadia_Marzouki,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Language English|Pages 295,"Western democracies are experiencing a new wave of right-wing populism that seeks to mobilize religion for its own ends. With chapters on the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Hungary, Poland and Israel, Saving the People asks how populist movements have used religion for their own ends and how Church leaders react to them. The authors contend that religion is more about belonging than belief for populists, with religious identities and traditions being deployed to define who can and cannot be part of ""the people."" This in turn helps many populists to claim that native Christian communities are being threatend by a creeping and highly aggressive process of Islamization, with Muslims becoming a key ""enemy of the people."" While Church elites generally condemn this instrumental use of religions, populists take little heed, presenting themselves as the true saviors of the people. The policy implications of this phenomenon are significant, which makes this book all the more timely and relevant to current debate.

Following such authors as A. Dulles, R. Swinburne, or K. Ward, Balazs Mezei investigates some of the main problems of revelation and connects them to the general problem of religion today. Religion is considered in the perspective of the age ""after Auschwitz"", an expression coined by Hans Jonas and further elaborated by J.B. Metz. Mezei develops the insights of these philosophers and investigates various aspects of religion and revelation ""after Auschwitz"": contemporary theistic philosophy, phenomenology, art, mysticism, and the question of university education today.

How were blood sacrifice and communal feasting related to identities in the ancient Greek city? With questions such as these, current scholarship aims to demonstrate the ways in which religion maps on to the socio-political structures of the Greek polis ('polis religion'). In this book Dr Kindt explores a more comprehensive conception of ancient Greek religion beyond this traditional paradigm. Comparative in method and outlook, the book invites its readers to embark on an interdisciplinary journey touching upon such diverse topics as religious belief, personal religion, magic and theology. Specific examples include the transformation of tyrant property into ritual objects, the cultural practice of setting up dedications at Olympia, and a man attempting to make love to Praxiteles' famous statue of Aphrodite. The book will be valuable for all students and scholars seeking to understand the complex phenomenon of ancient Greek religion""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Galileo Goes To Jail And Other Myths About Science And Religion,Ronald L.

""The authors necessarily spend the bulk of their time debunking attacks on religion in the name of science, but they also clear the muddy waters left behind when pro-religion forces try to obscure the scientific record ... Given all of the polemics published today, this is a breath of fresh air."" - Ryan T. Anderson, Weekly Standard. ""[This book was written] with ordinary readers, not specialists, in mind, making this a truly rare book; where else can you find such authoritative scholarship delivered so accessibly and fairly on such an important subject?"" - Edward B. Davis, belief.net. ""As a collection, these myth-busting arguments work to soften the wedge responsible for the schism between science and religion. The topics and writing style will appeal to all readers, but students of science and religion should consider this essential reading."" - J. A. Hewlett, Choice. - Back cover.  If we want nonscientists and opinion-makers in the press, the lab, and the pulpit to take a fresh look at the relationship between science and religion, Ronald L. Numbers suggests that we must first dispense with the hoary myths that have masqueraded too long as historical truths.  Until about the 1970s, the dominant narrative in the history of science had long been that of science triumphant, and science at war with religion. But a new generation of historians both of science and of the church began to examine episodes in the history of science and religion through the values and knowledge of the actors themselves. Now Ronald Numbers has recruited the leading scholars in this new history of science to puncture the myths, from Galileo’s incarceration to Darwin’s deathbed conversion to Einstein’s belief in a personal God who “didn’t play dice with the universe.” The picture of science and religion at each other’s throats persists in mainstream media and scholarly journals, but each chapter in Galileo Goes to Jail shows how much we have to gain by seeing beyond the myths.

Questioning western culture's evolving use of the word 'religion' over the last five centuries, Ralph Heintzman strips away misunderstandings to demonstrate that faith is not the same as belief. He shows how faith is not something one has but something one does, leading the reader to a deeper understanding of religious practice and its necessary place in human life.  Drawing on familiar experiences as well as aspects of western and eastern spiritual traditions, Heintzman argues that religious practice is rooted in two basic ways human beings act in the world. It is therefore an element in the structure of the human spirit, not a phase in its history. Explaining the meaning of religious practice in contemporary language, 'Rediscovering Reverence' is addressed to anyone who wants to explore the meaning and promise of a religious life.  A unique and thoughtful meditation on the role of reverence in everyday life, Rediscovering Reverence presents new perspectives on modern faith, religion, and both personal and societal well-being.""--Publisher's website.

Septimius Severus connected his reign to the divine support of Liber Pater and Hercules, while Caracalla placed a particular emphasis on the gods Apollo, Aesculapius and Sarapis. Elagabalus' reign was characterised by the worship of the Emesene deity Elagabal, which resulted in a renewed emphasis on the cult of Jupiter under Severus Alexander. Numismatic evidence is reintegrated into the wider material culture of the Severan period in order to bring new insights into the use of the divine in this period, as well as the role played by the provinces in the formation and reception of this ideology""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The birth of orientalism,Urs App,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL15909022W,/authors/OL5513577A/Urs_App,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  University of Pennsylvania Press|Language English|Pages 550,"""Modern Orientalism is not a brainchild of nineteenth-century European imperialists and colonialists, but, as Urs App demonstrates, was born in the eighteenth century after a very long gestation period defined less by economic or political motives than by religious ideology. Based on sources from a dozen languages, many unavailable in English, The Birth of Orientalism presents a completely new picture of this protracted genesis, its underlying dynamics, and the Western discovery of Asian religions from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. App documents the immense influence of Japan and China and describes how the Near Eastern cradle of civilization moved toward mother India. Moreover, he shows that some of India's purportedly oldest texts were products of eighteenth-century European authors. Though Western engagement with non-Abrahamic Asian religions reaches back to antiquity and can without exaggeration be called the largest-scale religiocultural encounter in history, it has so far received surprisingly little attention--which is why some of its major features and their role in the birth of modern Orientalism are described here for the first time. The study of Asian documents had a profound impact on Europe's intellectual makeup. Suddenly the Bible had much older competitors from China and India, Sanskrit threatened to replace Hebrew as the world's oldest language, and Judeo-Christianity appeared as a local phenomenon on a dramatically expanded, worldwide canvas of religions and mythologies. Orientalists were called upon as arbiters in a clash that involved neither gold and spices nor colonialism and imperialism but, rather, such fundamental questions as where we come from and who we are: questions of identity that demanded new answers as biblical authority dramatically waned""--Publisher description.

On les appelle « père du secret » et ils sont réputés pour être des érudits. C’est à eux que s’adressent bon nombre de havanais, quels que soient le sexe, l’âge, la couleur de peau ou les convictions politiques, afin de savoir ce qu’il faut faire pour « résoudre » un problème ou pour avoir « la santé » (du bien-être). Ce livre, fruit de nombreux séjours de l’auteur à La Havane, offre une ethnographie fouillée de pratiques rituelles divinatoires et initiatiques cubaines, avec leurs origines africaines et leurs apports chrétiens, qui se déroulent dans le présent du XXIe siècle. Il décrit avec précision comment la divination Ifá est tramée par des procédures que le devin est tenu de suivre et comment, en même temps, tout l’art de celui-ci réside dans le fait de poser les bonnes questions et d’interpréter efficacement les réponses qu’il obtient. L’auteur montre aussi comment l’interprétation du devin débouche sur des prescriptions sous la forme de rituels thérapeutiques, initiatiques ou d’offrandes que son client aura à exécuter. Divination Ifá et rites prescrits forment un système cohérent d’actions que l’auteur expose à l’aide d’une description détaillée d’un cycle rituel qui débute par la vie prénatale d’un homme ou d’une femme, et se termine par leur mort.

We can sustain respect and create peace with ""the other"" without doing harm to the sincerity of our own particular religious tradition. In the process, everyone learns and grows, experiencing greater religious tolerance and understanding.  The contributors to Interfaith Dialogue at the Grass Roots consider the patience and passion involved in promoting such interfaith activities. The essays seek to empower rabbis, imams, pastors, and their congregants to take up the work of interreligious dialogue as a peacemaking activity. The book provides guidelines for conducting interfaith encounters, showing how storytelling and conversations can make these meetings productive and constructive. Additional chapters reveal how to establish and inspire peace. Lastly, Joseph Stoutzenberger writes questions for reflection and suggestions for action at the end of each chapter.

He proposes that God be treated as a transferential figure whose analysis leads to a reduction of the parental content that is projected onto God. Merkur notes that religious conversion experiences regularly involve theological intuitions that are either rational or, owing to morbid complications, have undergone displacement into irrational symbolism. Analysis renders the religiosity more wholesome. Traditionally, psychoanalytic thought has been dismissive of religion. Freud is on record, however, as having called psychoanalysis a neutral procedure. He argued that religion, with its dependency on a providential God who punishes disobedience, imagines spirituality on the model of human parents and fails to approach spirituality in an appropriately scientific manner. He wrote little of spiritual phenomena, but mentioned both the rationality of the universe and the parapsychological occurrence of thought transference. Occasionally, later psychoanalysts used different language in order to contrast wholesome and morbid forms of religion. Erich Fromm distinguished authoritarian and humanistic religions, while D. W. Winnicott condemned fetishistic behavior while approving of playful illusions that require “belief-in.” These formulations constructed a middle position for clinicians, neither categorically opposed to religion as classical psychoanalysis was, nor do they embrace cultural relativity as “spiritually oriented” psychotherapists are currently advocating. What sorts of spiritual practices does psychoanalysis find unobjectionable? As examples of humanistic religion, Fromm named Zen Buddhism, Buddhist mindfulness meditation, and the via negativa or “way of negating” that some Christian and Jewish mystics have followed. Because the Bible-based approaches are little known, Merkur discusses their histories, procedures, and psychoanalytic understanding.--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Eršema prayers are relatively short compositions belonging to the larger corpus of Emesal prayers, and they were part of the repertoire of a cultic functionary known as the gala/kalu. The content of these prayers, like that of the other genres of Emesal prayers, is usually lamentful, mourning the destruction of cities and temples. The book treats both types of Eršemas known from the first millenium BC: those appended to longer Emesal prayers known as Balag compositions, and individual Eršema prayers (""Ritual Ersemas""). Over eighty prayers are listed in an ancient catalog from Nineveh. This book edits them according to their sequence in the Nineveh catalog and on the basis of over one hundred tablets and fragments stemming from various provenances, especially Nineveh, Babylon, and Uruk. The book also includes editions of unidentified Eršemas and of other fragments that may be Eršemas. In addition to a score transliteration, a translation, and philological notes, the evidence for the ritual performance of each Eršema is provided. Where Old Babylonian forerunners and first-millennium BC parallels, especially from Balag compositions, are known, they are presented in synoptic transliterations with the Eršemas they parallel.""--P. 4 cover.

Reed, an expert in biblical archaeology, reveal through archaeology and textual scholarship that Paul, like Jesus, focused on championing the Kingdom of God––a realm of justice and equality––against the dominant, worldly powers of the Roman empire.Many theories exist about who Paul was, what he believed, and what role he played in the origins of Christianity. Using archaeological and textual evidence, and taking advantage of recent major discoveries in Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Syria, Crossan and Reed show that Paul was a fallible but dedicated successor to Jesus, carrying on Jesus's mission of inaugurating the Kingdom of God on earth in opposition to the reign of Rome. Against the concrete backdrop of first–century Grego–Roman and Jewish life, In Search of Paul reveals the work of Paul as never before, showing how and why the liberating messages and practices of equality, caring for the poor, and a just society under God's rules, not Rome's, were so appealing.

One that disproves accepted archeology and history? Then you need to get ""Celtic Mysteries in New England"" by Philip Imbrogno and Marianne Horrigan.    You see, there are over sixty-five mysterious small buildings throughout New England. Archeologists dismiss them as root cellars from colonial times. But if they are just root cellars, why are there no records of them being made by the colonists? Why is it that in one record a colonist — who found one already made and on his property — was told by a priest to avoid it? Why is it that many are aligned to certain stars that are associated with the ancient Druids? Why do some have intricate carvings on the walls?    In order to answer these and many more questions, the authors start on a journey of discovery, and take you along on a wild ride that threatens to shake the very foundations of history! You will go along with them as they discover factual evidence of European explorers visiting the Americas nearly 1,000 years before Columbus. You will learn how the Druids came over and built these constructions as part of their religion.    In Europe, such constructions are known to appear along lines of energy and power. So are these. You will discover how they are frequently the center for the appearance of odd lights and UFOs. Scientific evidence shows them to be centered on weird, magnetic field anomalies.    If you are ready to discover the Celtic past of the Americas, you need to get this book. It will also intrigue and thrill archeologists, paranormalists, and people who just want to know the truth.

Kuecker draws on resources from social identity theory to demonstrate that in Luke's narrative the Spirit is the central figure in the formation of a new social identity. In his argumentation Kuecker provides extended exegetical treatments of Luke 1-4 and Acts 1-15. He shows that Luke 1-4 establishes a foundation for Luke's understanding of the relationship between human identity, the Spirit, and the 'other'--especially as it relates to the distribution of in-group benefits beyond group boundaries. With regard to Acts 1-15, Kuecker shows that the Spirit acts whenever human identity is in question in order to transform communities and individuals via the formation of a new social identity.... This transformed identity produces profound expressions of interethnic reconciliation in Luke-Acts expressed through reformed economic practice, impressive intergroup hospitality, and a reoriented use of ethnic language""--Provided by publisher.

The Father/Spirit plunging into the Mother/Matter human body. In many religions, the Male was represented by fire, the Sun or possibly a small flame,while the female was represented by water or the Moon, or possibly a candle for instance.....material things. Matter is ""Virgin"" until it receives the Spirit of life. So sex would symbolize the immersion of spirit into matter. A very good read.

""Spiritual bonding is the process by which a couple cultivates the presence of God in their relationship,"" he says, ""and it's the only 'glue' that sustains relationships long-term."" Working with hundreds of couples, Clarke observes that when we take specific steps to keep God at the center of our relationships, every area of intimacy is energized. This book teaches men and women in a committed relationship how to pray together, create ""spiritual conversations,"" read and study Scripture together, hold private worship sessions, and allow the Holy Spirit to guide them.

In one, multiple faiths and nonfaiths coexist free from a dominant belief in God. In the other, we deny the sacred altogether and exclude religion from rational thought and behavior. But is there a third way for those who wish to rediscover the sacred in a skeptical society? What kind of faith, if any, can be proclaimed after the ravages of the Holocaust and the many religion-based terrors since? Richard Kearney explores these questions with a host of philosophers known for their inclusive, forward-thinking work on the intersection of secularism, politics, and religion. An interreligious dialogue that refuses to paper over religious difference, these conversations locate the sacred within secular society and affirm a positive role for religion in human reflection and action. Drawing on his own philosophical formulations, literary analysis, and personal interreligious experiences, Kearney develops through these engagements a basic gesture of hospitality for approaching the question of God.0His work facilitates a fresh encounter with our best-known voices in continental philosophy and their views on issues of importance to all spiritually minded individuals and skeptics: how to reconcile God's goodness with human evil, how to believe in both God and natural science, how to talk about God without indulging in fundamentalist rhetoric, and how to balance God's sovereignty with God's love.

The barefoot boys started their own football team-the Stars of Sidi Moumen. They played amongst the rocks, detritus, and buried skeletons of the dump but they dreamed of becoming the best football players of all time. From the grave, Yachine remembers the ugliness but also recalls his fond memories of childhood: ""I'm not ashamed to tell you I was sometimes happy in that hideous squalor, on the filth of that accursed cesspit, yes, I was happy in Sidi Moumen, my home. ."" Then their dreams changed. Yachine's older brother Hamid started growing a beard and attending religious meetings with Sheikh Abou Zoubeir. Week after week, the sheikh beguiled the Stars of Sidi Moumen into believing that there was a better world in the afterlife, where their faith in Allah would be rewarded. They needed only to choose between dying gloriously and together, or living disgracefully and alone. For Yachine and his brother, the choice was clear.

Organized around seven key myths-representing the Irish, Greek, Sumerian, Indonesian, Amazonian, and Inuit cultures, as well as the fantasy world of J. R. R. Tolkien-this book is the perfect introduction to the common themes found in world mythology. Curtiss Hoffman, archaeologist and anthropologist, takes us beyond the entertaining stories and uses insights from cultural anthropology and analytical psychology to analyze the many common themes found throughout. In particular, he examines the significance of names, numbers, plants, animals, the heavenly bodies, and the human body.--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

In the first part, it recognizes the importance of the centuries-old reflection on hope by offering historical perspectives and tracing it back to ancient Greek philosophy. At the same time, it provides novel perspectives on often-overlooked historical theories and developments and challenges established views. The second part of the volume documents the state of the art of current research in hope across eight disciplines, which are philosophy, theology, psychology, economy, sociology, health studies, ecology, and development studies. Taken together, this volume provides an integrated view on hope as a multi-faced phenomenon. It contributes to the further understanding of hope as an essential human capacity, with the possibility of transforming our human societies.

With a mixture of dread and determination, Paul left his job, traveled to Georgia, and took his first steps on the Appalachian Trail. What he learned during the next four and a half months changed his life--and can change yours as well.  In Hiking Through, you'll join Paul on his remarkable 2,176-mile trip through fourteen states in search of peace and a renewed sense of purpose. Along the way, you'll meet fascinating and funny people, experience trail magic, and discover that every choice we make on the path has consequences for the journey. More than that, you'll come away with a new understanding of God's grace and guidance--even in the smallest things.  ""Hiking Through is a page-turner! Being a hiker, I have read a number of books about the AT; this one is different. It is about accomplishing a goal but it is also about love, family, friendship, change, discovery, healing, and so much more. Hope you enjoy the read as much as I did!""--Dr. Steve Wingfield, founder of the Steve Wingfield Evangelistic Association and author of Live the Adventure  ""For a serious backpacker to be interested in yet another version of how it is to hike the entire Appalachian Trail, a book must have a unique twist. Some writers use romance to delineate them from the others, some use spirituality to be different, some humor, some life's struggles, and some the trail itself and the challenges that it presents. Hiking Through has it all!""--Bill Irwin, speaker, author of Blind Courage, counselor, and executive director of Free Indeed Ministries, with Orient, hero dog-guide of the Appalachian Trail  Paul Stutzman is a restaurant-manager-turned-captivating-storyteller who left his career after his wife's death from breast cancer.

This edited volume presents twelve chapters of fresh scholarship on diverse facets of the area where they meet: religious anarchism. The book is structured along three themes: early Christian anarchist 'pioneers,' including Pelagius, Coppe, Hungarian Nazarenes, and Dutch Christian anarchists; Christian anarchist reflections on specific topics such as Kierkegaardian indifference, Romans 13, Dalit religious practice, and resistance to race and nation; religious anarchism in other traditions, ranging from Wu Nengzi s Daoism and Rexroth s Zen Buddhism to various currents of Islam, including an original Anarca-Islamic 'clinic.' This unique book therefore furthers scholarship on anarchism, on millenarian and revolutionary thinkers and movements, and on religion and politics. It is also of value to members of the wider public interested in radical politics and in the political implications of religion. And of course, it is relevant to those interested in any of the specific themes and thinkers focused on within individual chapters. In short, this book presents a range of innovative perspectives on a web of topics that, while held together by the common thread of religious anarchism, also speaks to numerous broader themes which have been increasingly prominent in the twenty-first century.

Eternal life: pious dream or realistic hope?,John Shelby Spong,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL1816733W,/authors/OL217856A/John_Shelby_Spong,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24274816M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Harper One|Language English,"Bishop John Shelby Spong, author of Jesus for the Non-Religious, Why Christianity Must Change or Die, Sins of Scripture, and many other books, is known for his controversial ideas and fighting for minority rights. In Eternal Life: A New Vision, a remarkable spiritual journey about his lifelong struggle with the questions of God and death, he reveals how he came to a new conviction about eternal life. God, says spong, is ultimately one, and each of us is part of that oneness. We do not live on after death as children who have been rewarded with heaven or punished with hell but as part of the life and being of God, sharing in God's eternity, which is beyond the barriers of time and space. spong argues that the discovery of the eternal can be found within each of us if we go deeply into ourselves, transcend our limits and become fully human. By seeking God within, by living each day to its fullest, we will come to understand how we live eternally.Always compelling and controversial, Spong, the leading Christian liberal and pioneer for human rights, wrestles with the question that all of us will ultimately face. In his final book, Spong takes us beyond religion and even beyond Christianity until he arrives at the affirmation that the fully realized human life empties into and participates in the eternity of God. The pathway into God turns out to be both a pathway into ourselves and a doorway into eternal life. To Job's question ""If a man (or a woman) dies, will he (or she) live again?"" he gives his answer as a ringing yes!   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Islam and Anarchism: Relationships and Resonances,Mohamed Abdou,religion,First published in 2022,/works/OL26807549W,/authors/OL11280348A/Mohamed_Abdou,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL36346066M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2022-06-20|Publisher  Pluto Press|Language English|Pages 272,"Discourse around Muslims and Islam all too often lapses into a false dichotomy of Orientalist and fundamentalist tropes. A popular reimagining of Islam is urgently needed. Yet it is a perhaps unexpected political philosophical tradition that has the most to offer in this pursuit: anarchism.  Islam and Anarchism is a highly original and interdisciplinary work, which simultaneously disrupts two commonly held beliefs - that Islam is necessarily authoritarian and capitalist; and that anarchism is necessarily anti-religious and anti-spiritual. Deeply rooted in key Islamic concepts and textual sources, and drawing on radical Indigenous, Islamic anarchistic and social movement discourses, Abdou proposes 'Anarcha-Islam'.  Constructing a decolonial, non-authoritarian and non-capitalist Islamic anarchism, Islam and Anarchism philosophically and theologically challenges the classist, sexist, racist, ageist, queerphobic and ableist inequalities in both post- and neo-colonial societies like Egypt, and settler-colonial societies such as Canada and the USA.

He read parts of it as a child in Hebrew school, then at-tended a Christian high school where he studied the Old and New Testaments. Many of the highlights stuck with him — Adam and Eve, Cain versus Abel, Jacob versus Esau, Jonah versus whale, forty days and nights, ten plagues and commandments, twelve tribes and apostles, Red Sea walked under, Galilee walked on, bush into fire, rock into water, water into wine. And, of course, he absorbed from all around him other bits of the Bible — from stories he heard in churches and synagogues, in movies and on television, from his parents and teachers. But it wasn't until he picked up a Bible at a cousin's bat mitzvah — and became engrossed and horrified by a lesser-known story in Genesis — that he couldn't put it down. At a time when wars are fought over scriptural interpretation, when the influence of religion on American politics has never been greater, when many Americans still believe in the Bible's literal truth, it has never been more important to get to know the Bible. Good Book is what happens when a regular guy — an average Job — actually reads the book on which his religion, his culture, and his world are based. Along the way, he grapples with the most profound theological questions: How many commandments do we actually need? Does God prefer obedience or good deeds? And the most unexpected ones: Why are so many women in the Bible prostitutes? Why does God love bald men so much? Is Samson really that stupid? Good Book is an irreverent, enthralling journey through the world's most important work of literature.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The world you live in promotes sex as the answer to just about everything. The pressure to go along with the crowd is greater than ever before, and it's easy to compromise in little ways that are a lot more harmful than they seem.

From Christ to His Apostles, from the Apostles to ancient Africa, from Africa to America, and from black Americans to their sons and daughters. The ancient African Christian tradition is beginning to be passed on and take root in America today, growing out of the seed of the blood of the black American slave-martyrs for Christ.  In this collection of talks from the Ancient Christianity and African-American Conferences, we see how deep the resonances are between the faith of the early Church and the heartfelt Christianity born out of the slaves' experience on American soil. Indeed, the 'sad joyfulness' that characterized the African Desert Fathers and Mothers of the 4th century and that permeates traditional Christianity today, is our legacy from the suffering Church of the African-American slaves, our elders in the faith. Now that the link between America and the African Christianity tradition has been restored, the time has come to embrace the Unbroken Circle which is our rich heritage from the past...and our hope for the future.

In systematic fashion the influences of physical and social conditions are analized. The evolution of settlement from the nomad's tent to the tightly packed town is discussed. The planning elements and design strategies are identified. There is a collection of more than 200 examples from all thirteen countries comprising the Arab region. Each building is documented by means of plans, sections and elevations.    The author also discusses present times, the impact of the West on Arab architecture, contrasting Eastern and Western ways of planning and design. Water and waste management also receive proper attention. In an appendix brief appreciations of Hassan Fathy and the Aga Khan Program for Architecture are added, as well as two contemporary projects and planning guidelines.

But there are still so many people who aren't being reached, who don't want to come to church. And the truth is that attendance at church on Sundays does not necessarily transform lives; God's presence in our hearts is what changes us. Leaders and laypeople everywhere are realizing that they need new and more powerful ways to help them spread God's Word.  According to Neil Cole, if we want to connect with those who are not coming to church, we must go where people congregate. Cole shows readers how to plant the seeds of the Kingdom of God in the places where life happens and where culture is formed— restaurants, bars, coffeehouses, parks, locker rooms, and neighborhoods. Organic Church offers a hands-on guide for demystifying this new model of church and shows the practical aspects of implementing it.  While it may seem revolutionary, these simple, organic churches—bringing God's message where people are rather than expecting them to show up at church—is in keeping with the message of Jesus, who lived among the people of his time. Organic Church shows how we can return to those ancient roots by letting the church be alive, organic, growing, spreading in the most likely and unlikely places.

Avoiding simplistic distinctions between religion and politics, each of these essays suggests more satisfactory ways of approaching the complex nature of these dynamic phenomena. They explore the role of traditional religious values, symbols, affiliations, and/or leaders in dealing with contemporary sociopolitical realities, analyzing the way in which religious traditions help shape the understanding and meaning of contemporary political realities and how they are reinterpreted and used to accomplish political and religious goals.

Aboriginal Religions in Australia,Françoise Dussart,religion,First published in 2016,/works/OL32328158W,/authors/OL9511007A/Françoise_Dussart,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2016|Publisher  Taylor and Francis|Language English,"""Over the last 25 years there has been an explosion of interest in the Aboriginal religions of Australia and this anthology provides a variety of recent writings, by a wide range of scholars. Australian Aboriginal Religions are probably the oldest extant religious systems. Over some 50,000 years they have coped with change and re-invented themselves in an astonishingly creative way. The Dreaming, the mythical time when the Ancestor Spirits shaped the territories of the Aborigines and laid down a moral and ritual law for their occupants, is the fundamental religious reality. It is the basis of the Aborigines's view of their land or country, kinship relationships, ritual and art. However, the Dreaming is not a static principle since it is interpreted in different ways, as in the extraordinary movement in contemporary indigenous painting, and in attempts at an accommodation with Christianity. The contributions of anthropologists, cultural historians, philosophers of religion and others are included in this anthology which not only guides readers through the literature but also ensures this still largely inaccessible material is available to a wider range of readers and non-specialist students and academics.""--Provided by publisher.

""Two Turkish Christians and one German committed to taking the gospel to the country and people God had called him, began their day simply wanting to spend time with local men they thought genuinely wanted to study the Bible. Instead, five hostile young men met their kindness and hospitality with betrayal and treachery.  This is an uplifting account of the bravery of these men and God's constant faithfulness.  The lives, labors, and ultimate sacrifice of Necati Aydin, Ug ur Yuksel and Tilmann Geske as they sought to obey the Savior they loved will challenge and inspire you.  Their deaths while perhaps ignored or quickly forgotten even among Christians around the world, continue to speak. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.  Revelation 7:14  Very few followers of Christ in the rest of the world heard the story. Lost in the flood of news in our information age, it appeared to be just another senseless murder. But the deaths  of Necati Aydin, Ug ur Yuksel and Tilmann Geske, while perhaps ignored or quickly forgotten even among Christians around the world, continue to speak. They proclaim the truth that there are still those among us committed to witnessing to the gospel in difficult locations. They speak loudly of love for Christ and obedience to Him. They testify above the din about their commitment to share Jesus own experience of betrayal and sacrifice that purchased salvation for people from every tongue, tribe and nation.

Religion and Politics in America offers a lively, accessible, and balanced treatment of religion in American politics. The authors explore the historical, cultural, and legal contexts that underlie religious political engagement while also highlighting the pragmatic and strategic political realities that religious organizations and people face today. Incorporating up-to-date scholarship and analysis of voting behavior through the 2008 elections, the fourth edition assesses the politics of conventional and not-so-conventional American religious movements. Features include contemporary case studies, useful focus-study boxes, and timely discussions of Islam, Latinos, international affairs, and political culture. - Publisher.

Martin Williams presents a new account exploring the concept of salvation in this theologically rich letter. He brings together the disciplines of hermeneutics, New Testament studies, and systematic and historical theology in order to explore the language of salvation which resonates within the text. The book also elaborates on a methodological level the segregation which has arisen between Biblical studies and theological studies. In doing this, Williams identifies a basis for how there can be interaction between these two different viewpoints. This book will be a valuable resource for students and scholars interested in the exegesis and theology of 1 Peter, the doctrine of salvation and Biblical interpretation""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Drawing upon diplomatic correspondence in second millennium B.C.E. Mari to the eschatological hopes expressed in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the contributions indicate that all forms of prophetic and divinatory communication were used to both uphold and undermine their respective empires. The analyses of the Hebrew Bible show that, while Israelite/Judahite texts attempt to undermine the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian Empires, they never openly attack the Persian Empire. Further, the Israelite/Judahite thinkers never criticize empire as such; to the contrary, they paint a picture in which a Jerusalem empire will replace foreign ones. (back cover).

Attitudes to Gentiles in ancient Judaism and early Christianity,David C.

The Jewish relationship with and views about the Gentiles played an important part in Jewish self-definition, especially in the Diaspora where Jews formed the minority among larger Gentile populations. Jewish attitudes towards the Gentiles can be found in the writings of prominent Jewish authors (Josephus and Philo), sectarian movements and texts (the Qumran community, apocalyptic literature, Jesus) and in Jewish institutions such as the Jerusalem Temple and the synagogue. In the Christian tradition, which began as a Jewish movement but developed quickly into a predominantly Gentile tradition, the role and status of Gentile believers in Jesus was always of crucial significance. Did Gentile believers need to convert to Judaism as an essential component of their affiliation with Jesus, or had the appearance of the messiah rendered such distinctions invalid? This volume assesses the wide variety of viewpoints in terms of attitudes towards Gentiles and the status and expectations of Gentiles in the Christian church.--Amazon.com.

Among the gentiles,Luke Timothy Johnson,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL15615776W?edition=ia%3Aamonggentilesgre00john,/authors/OL226958A/Luke_Timothy_Johnson,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24565992M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Yale University Press|Language English|Pages 459,"The question of Christianity's relation to the other religions of the world is more pertinent and difficult today than ever before. While Christianity's historical failure to appreciate or actively engage Judaism is notorious, Christianity's even more shoddy record with respect to “pagan” religions is less understood. Christians have inherited a virtually unanimous theological tradition that thinks of paganism in terms of demonic possession, and of Christian missions as a rescue operation that saves pagans from inherently evil practices. In undertaking this fresh inquiry into early Christianity and Greco-Roman paganism, Luke Timothy Johnson begins with a broad definition of religion as a way of life organized around convictions and experiences concerning ultimate power. In the tradition of William James's Variety of Religious Experience, he identifies four distinct ways of being religious: religion as participation in benefits, as moral transformation, as transcending the world, and as stabilizing the world. Using these criteria as the basis for his exploration of Christianity and paganism, Johnson finds multiple points of similarity in religious sensibility. Christianity's failure to adequately come to grips with its first pagan neighbors, Johnson asserts, inhibits any effort to engage positively with adherents of various world religions.  This thoughtful and passionate study should help break down the walls between Christianity and other religious traditions. - Publisher.

In this remarkable book, Shaunti Feldhahn and Lisa Rice take you inside the mind of teens and preteens through the same innovative approach that seized national attention in the best-selling books For Women Only, For Men Only, and For Young Women Only. They explore the results of a nationwide survey and personal interviews with more than 1,000 real-life teens and tweens to tackle those things parents often don't ""get"" about their kids. You'll hear first-hand about the longings that drive your kids' seemingly illogical decisions, the truth behind those exasperating ""attitude problems,"" and what your children would tell you if they could trust you to truly listen.From the Hardcover edition.

He observes the Sabbath, he goes to synagogue, and he even flies to New York on weekends for a series of ""speed dates"" with nice, eligible Jewish girls. But, something is missing. Looking out of his window and across the street at one of the hundreds of churches in Atlanta, he asks, ""What would it be like to be a Christian?""So begins Benyamin Cohen's hilarious journey that is My Jesus Year — part memoir, part spiritual quest, and part anthropologist's mission. Among Cohen's many adventures (and misadventures), he finds himself in some rather unlikely places: jumping into the mosh-pit at a Christian rock concert, seeing his face projected on the giant JumboTron of an African-American megachurch, visiting a potential convert with two young Mormon missionaries, attending a Christian ""professional wrestling"" match, and waking up early for a sunrise Easter service on top of Stone Mountain — a Confederate memorial and former base of operations for the KKK.During his year-long exploration, Cohen sees the best and the worst of Christianity —  from megachurches to storefront churches; from crass commercialization of religion to the simple, moving faith of the humble believer; from the profound to the profane to the just plain laughable. Throughout, he keeps an open heart and mind, a good sense of humor, and takes what he learns from Christianity to reflect on his own faith and relationship to God. By year's end, to Cohen's surprise, his search for universal answers and truths in the Bible Belt actually make him a better Jew.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Governmental aid to church-affiliated elementary schools and colleges; state-sponsored prayer and Bible reading; curriculum that includes creationism; tax exemption of church property; publicly sponsored Christmas displays--these and other notable cases are discussed in Regan's chapters on the religious establishment clause. On the topic of the free-exercise clause, Regan considers such subjects as the value of religious freedom, as well as the place of religious beliefs in public schooling and government affairs. Important cases concerning conscientious objection to war, regulation of religious organizations and personnel, and western traditions of conscience are also examined.""--Publisher description.

He contend that religion is the main cause behind paradoxes in contemporary society. When we talk about paradoxes brought about by “religion”, we must clarify what “religion” is. The first chapter of this book offers a lucid definition of “religion”. Once we understand what religion is, we will have the opportunity to explore things from the unique angle of Buddhism and discover that all the religious devotees are looking for the Truth and should not discriminate against each other.

Most of the questions dealt with are big ones and raise all sorts of issues. It is clear that within the limits laid down (roughly 1,000 words for each answer) the writers are not able to deal with the questions completely or adequately. Nor do they make any pretense of doing so. All they attempt here is to face the questions honestly and sympathetically in the light of modern trends of thought, to indicate the general lines of approach from a Christian viewpoint and to stimulate further thought and inquiry on the part of the reader. - Editor's preface.

Rome's rationale for persecuting the early church,John C.

The author shows that the reason was something traditional historians dismissed a priori: that it was for Roman religious objections to Christian worship and proclamation, specifically, that the Christian worship of a crucified miscreant Jew as God, the faith in his physical resurrection, and the continued association with his ""body"" and spirit through the mass, violated a host of the most fundamental Greco-Roman taboos, and doing such were believed to anger and alienate the gods on whose favor the welfare of the empire depended.  The book also explains the sporadic nature of the persecutions before Decius (AD 250). The Romans simply waited for their gods to show their anger – such as by earthquakes, famines, conflagrations, floods, etc. – before setting out to purge the community of the albatross in their midst.  When disaster struck, the gods were obviously angry, and oracles were quick to finger the Christians.  When good times returned, the gods were obviously placated, and thus the persecutions could cease.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

What does the Bible really teach about the sin of Sodom and its destruction with Gomorrah and surrounding cities? Many Christians believe God rained down fire and brimstone on the ancient towns because its inhabitants were gay. But is there any evidence elsewhere in the Bible to support that homosexual behavior was prevalent in these places? This thesis closely studies the account of Sodom and Gomorrah to find out what the Bible really says about the past—and what it means for us today.  In addition to accurately interpreting the Bible, it’s crucial to understand the customs of the ancient world so that Scripture is set in its proper historical context. This guards against misinterpreting the text in the light of modern traditions, beliefs, and prejudices. The Sin of Sodom examines all the Scripture passages that mention Sodom to find out what they do—and don’t—say about why God destroyed the ancient cities of the Plain. It also reviews history and the interpretations of Old Testament scholars and early Church leaders to reveal the evolution of their understanding over the centuries and how this affects the beliefs of today’s Church.  What was the sin of Sodom, and why did God destroy it? Read this book to discover what the Bible really says.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Nichilismo ed esperienza religiosa dell'uomo moderno.

Tra i pensatori del nostro tempo che hanno preso sul serio questo interrogativo ed hanno cercato di darvi una risposta, Bernhard Welte (1906-1983) è forse il più emblematico. La via del nulla è considerata dal nostro autore percorso privilegiato alla fede, in quanto Dio stesso, nella forma storica in cui oggi si presenta, è nulla. Non deve perciò stupire il tentativo estremo portato avanti da Welte di conciliare la comprensione nichilistica del mondo con la fede cristiana.

This is especially the case for the birds: their identities are shrouded in mystery and the reasons for their prohibition debated. Peter Altmann attempts to break this impasse by setting these flyers within the broader context of birds and flying creatures in the Ancient Near East. His investigation considers the zooarcheological data on birds in the ancient Levant, iconographic and textual material on mundane and mythic flyers from Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as studying the symbolic functions of birds within the texts of the Hebrew Bible itself.

When these specific cultural contexts are marginalized, Islam is reduced to an ahistorical religion without the ability to contribute to humanity. This limited understanding of Islam has been a contributing factor in many of the violent conflicts in the present day.     Reflecting on Islam in Indonesia, the world?s third largest democracy, supporting the largest Muslim population, Ahmad Syafii Maarif argues for an understanding that is both faithful to Islam?s essential teachings and open to constantly changing social and cultural contexts. Building on this, he then addresses critical contemporary issues such as democracy, human rights, religious freedom, the status of women, and the future of Islam. Through this book the breadth and depth of the ideas of one of Indonesia?s foremost Muslim scholars are made accessible for English language readership.""

The common goal of these essays is to shed light on a certain number of issues: first, to try to understand the dynamics of expulsion, in particular its social and political causes; second, to examine how expelled communities integrate (or not) into their new host societies; and finally, to understand how the experiences of expulsion and exile are made into founding myths that establish (or attempt to establish) group identities.

The establishment of clinical ethics committees is a direct response to the professionalization of the medical establishment and the achievements in medical technology. Always progress in medicine was more than just technological advance. Especially its undeniable successes face doctors, nurses, chaplains and the management at the same time with new questions and problems. With the institutionalization of clinical ethics consultation connects the expectation of understanding the complex processes on a common basis. What taks are set for ethics committees in hospitals? How becomes ethic an issue there? And how do theologians and nurses communicate in these bodies? These papers summarize from a theological and philosophical point of view central research findings discussed in the framework of the DFG-funded research project ""Ethics and Organisation.

Just Faith,Stephan De Beer,religion,First published in 2018,/works/OL23500193W,/authors/OL8908762A/Stephan_De_Beer,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2018|Publisher  AOSIS|Pages 398,"The purpose of this scholarly book is to expand the body of knowledge available on urban theology. It introduces readers to the concept of planetary urbanisation, with the view of deepening an understanding of urbanisation and its all-pervasive impact on the planet, people and places from a theological perspective. A critical theological reading of ‘the urban’ is also provided, deliberating on bridging the divide between voices from the Global South and the Global North. In doing so, this book simultaneously seeks out robust and dynamic faith constructs, expressed in various forms and embodiments of justice. The methodology chosen transcended narrow disciplinary boundaries, situating reflections between and across disciplines, in the interface between scholarly reflection and an activist faith, as well as between local rootedness and global connectedness. This was facilitated by the collected gathering of authors, spanning all continents, various Christian faith traditions and multiple disciplines, as well as a range of methodological approaches.  The book endeavours to contribute to knowledge production in a number of ways. Firstly, it suggests the inadequacy of most dominant faith expressions in the face of all-pervasive forces of urbanisation, and it also provides clues as to the possibility of fostering potent alternative imaginaries. Secondly, it explores a decolonial faith that is expressed in various forms of justice. It is an attempt to offer concrete embodiments of what such a faith could look like in the context of planetary urbanisation. Thirdly, the book does not focus on one specific urban challenge or mode of ministry but rather introduces the concept of planetary urbanisation and then offers critical lenses with which to interrogate its consequences and challenges. It considers concrete and liberating faith constructs in areas ranging from gender, race, economic inequality, a solidarity economics and housing to urban violence, indigeneity and urbanisation, the interface between economic and environmental sustainability, and grass-roots theological education.

Ein Leben zwischen Laibach und Tuebingen - Primus Truber und seine Zeit,Rolf-Dieter Kluge,religion,First published in 1995,/works/OL23499864W,/authors/OL629742A/Rolf-Dieter_Kluge,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Publisher  Peter Lang International Academic Publishers|Pages 578,"The 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's year of birth in 1983 gave rise to a critical examination of his time and the developments he had begun that had changed the world so sustainably. The Reformation has also made a significant impact in the southeast of Europe. In order to make the Word of God directly accessible to as many people as possible, translations were made and distributed in print to churches and communities. Many smaller languages, including Slovene, were written in this way. This act is due to the Slovenes Primus Trüber (1508-1586). He played a central role in the Reformation in his home in Krainer, and thus came into ever closer contact with Protestant Germany, especially with the Duchy of Württemberg, which gradually became the outpost of German Lutheranism.  Die 500. Wiederkehr von Martin Luthers Geburtsjahr bot 1983 Anlaß, sich mit seiner Zeit und den von ihm in Gang gebrachten Entwicklungen, die die Welt so nachhaltig verändert haben, kritisch auseinanderzusetzen. Auch in den Südosten Europas hat die Reformation folgenreich ausgestrahlt. Um das Wort Gottes möglichst vielen Menschen direkt zugänglich zu machen, wurden Übersetzungen angefertigt und in gedruckter Form an Kirchen und Gemeinden verteilt. Viele kleinere Sprachen, darunter auch das Slowenische, gelangten auf diese Weise zur Schriftlichkeit. Diese Tat verdanken die Slowenen Primus Trüber (1508-1586). Er spielte eine zentrale Rolle für die Reformation in seiner Krainer Heimat und kam dadurch in immer engeren Kontakt mit dem protestantischen Deutschland, vornehmlich mit dem Herzogtum Württemberg, das allmählich zum Vorposten des deutschen Luthertums wurde.

Panentheism and Panpsychism,Godehard Brüntrup,religion,First published in 2020,/works/OL23501965W,/authors/OL3252394A/Godehard_Brüntrup,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2020|Pages 311,"Panpsychism has become a highly attractive position in the philosophy of mind. On panpsychism, both the physical and the mental are inseparable and fundamental features of reality. Panentheism has also become immensely popular in the philosophy of religion. Panentheism strives for a higher reconciliation of an atheistic pantheism, on which the universe itself is causa sui, and the ontological dualism of necessarily existing, eternal creator and contingent, ﬁnite creation. Historically and systematically, panpsychism and panentheism often went together as essential parts of an allembracing metaphysical theory of Being. The present collection of essays analyses the relation between panpsychism and panentheism and provides critical reﬂections on the signiﬁcance of panpsychistic and panentheistic thinking for recent debates in philosophy and theology.

In this groundbreaking work, John H. Evans reveals that, with a few limited exceptions, even the most conservative religious Americans accept science?s ability to make factual claims about the world. However, many religious people take issue with the morality implicitly promoted by some forms of science. Using clear and engaging scholarship, Evans upends the prevailing notion that there is a fundamental conflict over the way that scientists and religious people make claims about nature and argues that only by properly understanding moral conflict between contemporary religion and science will we be able to contribute to a more productive interaction between these two great institutions.

The establishment of clinical ethics committees is a direct response to the professionalization of the medical establishment and the achievements in medical technology. Always progress in medicine was more than just technological advance. Especially its undeniable successes face doctors, nurses, chaplains and the management at the same time with new questions and problems. With the institutionalization of clinical ethics consultation connects the expectation of understanding the complex processes on a common basis. What taks are set for ethics committees in hospitals? How becomes ethic an issue there? And how do theologians and nurses communicate in these bodies? These papers summarize from a theological and philosophical point of view central research findings discussed in the framework of the DFG-funded research project ""Ethics and Organisation.

Intergenerational transmission of 'religious capital',Pablo Brañas-Garza,religion,First published in 2006,/works/OL24061330W,/authors/OL9053377A/Pablo_Brañas-Garza,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2006|Publisher  IZA|Language English,"""The paper examines intergenerational transmission of 'religious capital' from parents to their offspring, within an economic framework of a production function of 'religiosity' where parental inputs serve as factors of production. A sample of Catholic Spaniards who grew up in Catholic households is used for the empirical study. A rich unique data base is employed with data on several aspects of religiosity: two dimensions of the individual's religiosity -- mass attendance (6 levels) and prayer (11 levels); information on the mother's and father's church attendance when the respondent was a child (9 levels) as well as the respondent's mass participation at the age of 12. The use of detailed religiosity measures (rather than one dichotomous variable, e.g. goes to church-yes/no; practicing Catholic -- yes/no), facilitates a more sophisticated analysis with robust conclusions. A theoretical framework is followed by stylized facts on household composition. Then the effect of the parents' input on respondent's religiosity is examined -- first using cross-tabulation and then using Ordered Logit regression. The inputs of the parents are proxied by the mother's and father's intensity of church attendance when the respondent was a child. The output (respondent's religiosity) is measured using detailed data on mass attendance and prayer. Exposure to mass services during childhood and socio-economic variables are also considered. All in all we find that parental religious inputs significantly affect individuals' religiosity BUT the route of intergenerational transmission is from mother to daughter and from father to son. Women are not affected by paternal religiosity and men are unaffected by maternal religiosity. Current religiosity is also affected by own exposure to mass services during childhood -- own experience has a more pronounced effect on the private/intimate activity of prayer than on the social/public activity of church attendance. Current mass participation is more affected by parental than by own mass attendance during childhood""--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.

Tapi apakah kalimat tersebut belumlah terang maksudnya sehingga harus dijelaskan secara panjang-lebar? Haduuh. Wong jomblo kontemporer saja sering sengaja salah memahami kalimat pendek yang diluncurkan perempuan barang misalnya “kamu terlalu baik untukku” sebagai pujian kok, apalagi ini persoalan fundamental. Bahwa persoalan kangen merupakan hal yang paling fundamental bagi seseorang yang masih beriman pada jarak.  Tak ada gagasan baru dalam buku ini, seperti halnya orang-orang terdahulu sudah merasakan kangen dan kini kita juga turut menyandang kangen. Apa yang saya tulis mungkin hanya merekonstruksi kalimatnya dengan tetap memakai gagasan para pendahulu, tetapi meski demikian ia harus tetap dituliskan demi melaksanakan repetisi. Sesuatu yang diulang bukan hanya memverifikasi bahwa sesuatu itu penting, melainkan juga menunjukkan bahwa kehidupan selalu mengandung unsur resonansi.

In Uncensored Grace, Jud Wilhite and Bill Taaffe introduce you to card players, exotic dancers, a flying Elvis, an American Idol contestant, and a beat cop turned hero, among others. Each has one thing in common--at their moment of extreme need they encounter an extraordinary God. And the place they find him is in an unusual church community that is gambling everything on a hope-filled message they call ""uncensored grace.""Writes Jud, ""As a pastor, I completely  misjudged what grace could look like in my world. Sure, I believed in a God who passionately pursues every human being, no matter how beat up or broken. I believed, but not enough. Not nearly.""Welcome to the streets of Vegas. What happens here could change your life.""In Uncensored Grace, Jud Wilhite describes the life-changing power of God's forgiveness as it's encountered on the streets of Vegas.

It's easy to get confused about how to please God. One Bible teacher details a long list of the commands you should be keeping. The next teacher says only grace matters.

Loving God and Others looks at how these two commands define the heart of Christian faith.

By all appearances, it looks like we are 'doing' church better than we ever have. Our programs are effective, our pastors are relevant, and our buildings are increasing in size. In the past 30 years the number of mega-churches has increased from under 100 to over 7,500. In the past 10 years the number of multi-site churches has increased from under 100 to over 2,000. By the numbers, these church movements enjoy the national platform, the national voice, and the resources to profoundly impact the Kingdom.   But to what end? In spite of the rapid growth of these prevailing church movements we are still losing ground, and the church in the west is in massive decline. Numerous studies and books have been written documenting the flight of members from the institutional church.   Yet the local church is Jesus' plan for reaching the world.   The strength of the mega-church and multi-site models can be found in a strong emphasis on attracting people to the church, where they have an opportunity to encounter Jesus Christ. Yet many younger leaders are rejecting this model in favor of a more incarnational approach to ministry. These missional communities tend to focus their attention on trying to release people into ministry.  In recent years a growing schism has emerged between those calling themselves incarnational leaders and those leading the prevailing church models. But what if we were able to incorporate the insights of both models into a cohesive understanding of the church? Can we bring together the very best of the attractional AND missional models for church ministry?  What is needed is not is another book about how to do church better. Our focus on the form church is misguided when the vast majority of unchurched Christians and non-believers aren't moving toward any form of church. Beautifully Sent will give permission for leaders to value existing church forms while catalyzing a missional movement of incarnational people into the world.

But somehow we get stalled. We start on a weight-loss program with good intentions but cannot stay on track. Neither the countless fad diets, nor the annual spending of $50 billion on weight loss helps us feel better or lose weight.Too many of us are in a cycle of shame and guilt. We spend countless hours worrying about what we ate or if we exercised enough, blaming ourselves for actions that we can't undo. We are stuck in the past and unable to live in the present—that moment in which we do have the power to make changes in our lives.With Savor, world-renowned Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh and Harvard nutritionist Dr. Lilian Cheung show us how to end our struggles with weight once and for all.Offering practical tools, including personalized goal setting, a detailed nutrition guide, and a mindful living plan, the authors help us to uncover the roots of our habits and then guide us as we transform our actions. Savor teaches us how to easily adopt the practice of mindfulness and integrate it into eating, exercise, and all facets of our daily life, so that being conscious and present becomes a core part of our being.It is the awareness of the present moment, the realization of why we do what we do, that enables us to stop feeling bad and start changing our behavior. Savor not only helps us achieve the healthy weight and well-being we seek, but it also brings to the surface the rich abundance of life available to us in every moment.

What You Don't Know about Men Will Hurt You.What You Don't Know about Relationships Will Cost You.Why does the modern-day search for romance so often end in disappointment, especially for women? Is it something we do? Something we don't do? Are we missing important information about the opposite sex--or about ourselves? Is there something wrong with us that we long so desperately for ""til death do us part""?  Sadly, many women today see their ongoing singleness as a weakness or lack of worth. In truth, our dreams go unfulfilled not because we do not deserve for them to come true, but often because of wrong assumptions--assumptions that can easily be corrected. Drawing on both male and female perspectives, this book deals with the hard issues and questions you and other women ponder as you consider how to obtain lasting love. What Women Don't Know (and Men Don't Tell You) will help you adjust your desires, redefine what you are attracted to, set your values in order, and determine your goals--freeing you at last to pursue the loving relationship you desire.From the Trade Paperback edition.

This last volume is the most incendiary, and it clearly dissolves the boundaries of organized religion and national ego that keep us from the table of friendship that Rumi invites us to. . . . We are very grateful to Dr. Ergin for his life's work.""Coleman Barks, translator of The Essential RumiAfter his overwhelming and life-altering encounters with Shams of Tabriz, Rumi, the great thirteenth-century mystic, poet, and originator of the whirling dervishes, let go of many of the precepts of formal religion, insisting that only a complete personal dissolving into the larger energies of God could provide the satisfaction that the heart so desperately seeks. He began to speak spontaneously in the language of poetry, and his followers compiled his more than forty-four thousand verses into twenty-three volumes, collectively called the Divan-i Kebir.When Nevit Ergin decided to translate Rumi's divan into English, he enlisted the help of the Turkish government, which was happy to participate. The first twenty-two volumes were published without difficulty, but the government withdrew its support and refused to participate in the publication of the final volume due to its openly heretical nature. Now, in The Forbidden Rumi, Nevit Ergin and Will Johnson present for the first time in English Rumi's poems on love and intoxication from this forbidden volume. The collection is grouped into three sections: songs to Shams and God, songs of advice and admonition, and songs of heresy. Rumi explains that in order to transform our consciousness, we must let go of ingrained habits and embrace new ones. In short, we must become heretics.NEVIT O. ERGIN, a Turkish-born surgeon, is the original translator of the entirety of Rumi's 44,829 verses into English. He has been a student of Sufism and the poetry of Rumi since 1955 and published his first Rumi translation in 1992. With the publication of The Forbidden Rumi, his translation of Rumi's work is complete. He lives in California. WILL JOHNSON is the founder and director of the Institute for Embodiment Training, which combines Western somatic psychotherapy with Eastern meditation practices. He is the author of several books, including the award-winning Rumi: Gazing at the Beloved. He lives in British Columbia.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

This re-release of Different Children, Different Needs clarifies what the Bible means when it commands us to ""train up a child in the way he should go"" (Proverbs 22:6). It teaches moms and dads how to understand the personality God has given each of their children and how to tailor their parenting styles to meet their children's needs. Pastor Charles Boyd uses the popular DISC personality assessment model to help parents better recognize, accept, and appreciate their kids' temperaments.IF ONLY YOUR PARENTS HAD READ THIS BOOK... Do you know whether your child is determined, influencing, soft-hearted, or conscientious? The key to effective parenting is knowing what motivates your child. The information and tools provided in Different Children, Different Needs will take the mystery out of the way you interact with each other. You'll begin to realize things you never understood about the best way to relate to each unique son or daughter. Your children will come to realize how God has designed and gifted them, growing in confidence and finding a sense of belonging. And you'll enjoy the fulfilling parenting experience you've always wished for.Story Behind the BookBased on the biblical teaching of Proverbs 22:6, the principles in this book can become the backbone for everything you do as a parent. If you don't practice the ""big picture"" principle presented in Different Children, Different Needs , your kids will be negatively affected. But if you take Proverbs 22:6 seriously and seek to apply what you find in this book, your children will come to understand how God has designed and gifted them. They will grow to have both a sense of confidence and a sense of belonging. Just when you master the art of parenting one child, here comes another--and they're ""different as night and day."" You must learn how to tailor your own unique parenting style to meet your children's special needs more effectively.

We are in danger, says Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, of forgetting what Judaism's place is within the global project of humankind. During the last two thousand years, Jews have lived through persecutions that would have spelled the end of most nations, but they did not see anti-Semitism written into the fabric of the universe. They knew they existed for a purpose, and it was not for themselves alone. Rabbi Sacks believes that the Jewish people have lost their way, that they need to recommit themselves to the task of creating a just world in which the divine presence can dwell among us. Without compromising one iota of Jewish faith, Rabbi Sacks declares, Jews must stand alongside their friends--Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, and secular humanist--in defense of freedom against the enemies of freedom, in affirmation of life against those who desecrate life. And they should do this not to win friends or the admiration of others but because it is what a people of God is supposed to do.Rabbi Sacks's powerful message of tikkun olam--using Judaism as a blueprint for repairing an imperfect world--will resonate with people of all faiths.From the Hardcover edition.

Who is this complex man whose office grants him sole charge of the world's largest religion? How will his tenure influence the future? The Essential Pope Benedict XVI answers these questions through carefully chosen selections from his homilies, interviews, theological essays, and articles on the crises facing the church today. This collection lays out Benedict's thinking and relates it to a variety of contemporary issues, including modern culture's abandonment of traditional religious values, social mores regarding conception and the sanctity of life, current challenges to the priesthood, and the Catholic Church's tenuous relations with other world religions.First a brilliant peritus, or ""expert advisor,"" to the Second Vatican Council and then archbishop of Munich, Joseph Ratzinger was appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope John Paul II in 1981. As Cardinal Ratzinger, the ex officio defender of church doctrine, he gained a reputation as a heroic guardian of the faith for conservatives and was held in suspicion by church liberals.We cannot yet know what issues and events will define the reign of Pope Benedict XVI, but by any measure he will be seen as one of the most important theological voices of our time. This one volume is the best source for understanding the heart, soul, and agenda of this twenty-first-century successor to St. Peter.

Violence. Scandal. These are words we rarely associate with the sacred text of the Bible. Yet in this brilliant new book, Jonathan Kirsch shows that the Old Testament is filled with some of the most startling and explicit stories in all of Western literature. These tales of seduction and rape, voyeurism and exhibitionism, intermarriage and illegitimacy, assassination and murder have been suppressed by religious authorities throughout history precisely because they are so shocking. ""You mean that's in the Bible?"" is the common reaction of the contemporary reader to the stories that Kirsch retells and explores.In The Harlot by the Side of the Road, Kirsch recounts these suppressed and mistranslated tales in the grand storytelling tradition. Here is the tale of Dinah, the young Israelite daughter raped by a princely suitor. The price for her hand in marriage? The circumcision of every man in his kingdom. Here, too, is the story of Lot's daughters, who, when faced with the possibility that they are the last survivors on earth, must copulate with their drunken father to continue their race. And the story of Tamar, the harlot by the side of the road, who must disguise herself as a prostitute and seduce her father-in-law in order to bear the child who has been promised her. Kirsch places each story within the political and social context of its time, and delves into the latest biblical scholarship to explain why each story was originally censored. He also brings to light when and WHERE each story was first written down, and how it found its way into the Bible. And he shows how these stories have something important to say to contemporary readers who might never pick up a Bible.Kirsch reveals that the Bible's real power lies in its unflinching lessons in human nature. And he illuminates the surprising modernity of the Bible's characters: these were, LIKE us, people delicately balanced between their destructive and generous natures. Certain to excite controversy and ignite intellectual debate, The Harlot by the Side of the Road will undoubtedly be one of the year's most talked-about books.From the Hardcover edition.

Jakes focuses on the problems plaguing the United States of America and addresses issues that many would rather not consider.    * Racism, though more sophisticated and attitudinal, is as prevalent as it was before the Civil Rights Bill.    * Homosexuality has become an acceptA‚A­able alternative lifestyle.    * Degenerative soA‚A­cial and moral issues result in sin and hopelessness-inside churches as well as outside.For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us... (1 Peter 4:17).God knows who is responsible for the breakdown and corrosion within our nation-the church. Until now, no one was willing to take responsibility for society's moral decay; and no one was offering any viable, long-lasting solutions. Today, Bishop Jakes shares how you can make a difference and bring in The Harvest for the glory of God.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Whether it be a part of a formal service recited with a congregation of worshipers or an individual, quiet moment, prayer is part of the lives of people from a variety of religions. There seems to be an innate urge among humanity to connect with a higher source of energy and love when we need guidance or direction, and this is called prayer. By reading the prayers from religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, from cultures in Africa, India, Egypt, and China, we begin to share the sense of a common experience. The deepest inner feelings and longings are similar—concern for family, assistance in healing, a longing for peace, or a wish for greater wisdom. For some people, prayer can be thought of as a way to ask for specific goals or special favors. This type of prayer may or may not be effective. Another type of prayer exists when all selfish desire is put aside and we feel ourselves in communion with God. At this point, our greatest wish is that God’s will be done. There may be pressing concerns that make us turn our sights upward, but we learn to let go of the end result. At this point, prayer becomes a way of opening up to the universal, loving, creative energy that exists and is far greater than any person could imagine. This is the source of miracles, of faith ad unconditional love. Prayer then becomes more than a means to an end; it becomes a state of humility and of awe. It can exist whether we are washing the floor or composing a symphony. Prayer is communion with the Divine, a universal loving creative force that exists in a variety of ways for people around the world. This book brings together an inspirational collection of prayer suitable for all ages and traditions. In addition, it offers insight and guidance about the nature of prayer that will be useful for the serious seeker.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Allison Pittman learned this all too well when she adopted a ""tiny, shiny puppy of indefinable breed(s)."" Stella wasted no time in turning her home upside-down as only a pup can.    As could be expected, six weeks of obedience school covered the much needed basics--sit, stay, come, and down. What Allison didn't expect was the spiritual benefit she would receive as each Saturday lesson revealed a fascinating metaphor. In this heart-warming, thoughtful, and often hilarious tribute to her beloved Stella, Allison Pittman shares how she came to understand what it means to follow the ultimate Master, including how to: Sit!--at the feet of Jesus and listen for His voiceDrop It!--and let go of personal agendas Come!--when it's time to run in the right directionStay!--in God's presence  In Saturdays with Stella, a slightly neurotic yet curiously adorable canine will not only capture your heart--she'll show you how captivating you are to God.From the Trade Paperback edition.

The Hidden Power of the Gospels,Alexander Shaia,religion,First published in 2010,/works/OL15186791W,/authors/OL4248584A/Alexander_Shaia,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24318881M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2010|Publisher  HarperCollins|Language English,"Christianity is in crisis. Increasing numbers of people are ""opting out."" Why? Have recent discoveries in archaeology uprooted our faith in the Bible? Do the gospels no longer serve our modern, complicated lives? In The Hidden Power of the Gospels, Dr. Alexander Shaia moves beyond the typical approach to reveal an undiscovered truth that's been dormant for over one thousand years.In the tradition of such writers as Thomas Moore and Don Miguel Ruiz, Shaia reveals how the recurring cycles of change, loss, enlightenment, and maturation are illuminated by the Bible's four gospels. Combining ancient Christian traditions, anthropology, and modern psychology, he reveals what has been in front of our eyes for two thousand years: that each of the gospels is centered on a different core metaphor and each focuses on a vital spiritual question.Matthew begins with the question ""How do we face change?"" Mark poses the hard question of ""How do we move through suffering?"" John stirs and elevates the soul as he asks, ""How do we receive joy?"" And Luke moves us forward on the practical path, as he inquires, ""How do we mature in service?"" Shaia weaves these questions together in what he calls the quadratos journey, a recurring fourfold cycle that lives on as a constant companion throughout our lives.Shaia unravels the divine inspiration of this mysterious sequence and links its ancient truths to universal, modern understandings. By using this lens, the gospels become practical guides for creating faith-filled lives that are relevant and useful in a time that is much more complex than village life millennia ago. In the sequence Shaia discloses, the gospels become the map for our never-ending spiritual journey.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Historians have long debated the (re)birth of Judaism in the wake of the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple cult by the Romans in 70 CE. What replaced that sacrificial cult was at once something new-indebted to the very culture of the Roman overlords-even as it also sought to preserve what little it could of the old Israelite religion. The Greco-Roman culture in which rabbinic Judaism grew in the first five centuries of the Common Era nurtured the development of Judaism as we still know and celebrate it today. Arguing that its transformation from a Jerusalem-centered cult to a world religion was made possible by the Roman Empire, Rabbi Burton Visotzky presents Judaism as a distinctly Roman religion. Full of fascinating detail from the daily life and culture of Jewish communities across the Hellenistic world, Aphrodite and the Rabbis will appeal to anyone interested in the development of Judaism, religion, history, art and architecture.

Daniel C. Snell traces key developments in the history, daily life, and religious beliefs of the people of Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, and Iran. His research investigates the influence of those ideas on the West, with particular emphasis on how religious ideas from this historical and cultural milieu persist to influence the way modern cultures and religions view the world. Designed to be accessible to students and readers with no prior knowledge of the period, the book uses fictional vignettes to add interest to its material, which is based on careful study of archeological remains and preserved texts. The book will provide a thoughtful summary of the Ancien Near East and includes a comprehensive bibliography to guide readers in further study of related topics""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Genesis enigma: why the Bible is scientifically accurate,Andrew Parker,religion,First published in 2009,/works/OL11781186W,/authors/OL5017628A/Andrew_Parker,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL24274293M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2009|Publisher  Penguin Group|Language English,"An acclaimed, paradigm-shifting evolutionary biologist shows how the biblical story of Genesis uncannily reflects recent scientific discoveries—and finds room for divine inspiration within.Consider this: Genesis recounts the story of creation, step-by-step: ""Let there be light""; ""Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear""; ""Let the earth bring forth [vegetation]""; ""Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life""; ""God created the whales""; ""And God created . . . every winged fowl."" For thousands of years, Judeo-Christian belief has accepted this progression as truth. And now, thanks to recent scientific discoveries, the scientific community does, too (though without the mention of ""God"").In The Genesis Enigma, respected evolutionary biologist Andrew Parker explains each parallel between Genesis and science in detail—and the closer he looks, the more amazing the parallels become. But the Genesis account has no right to be correct. The author or authors could not have known these things happened in this order, and with the highlights science has come to recognize.Ultimately, Parker argues, it must be divine inspiration that guided the writing of the Bible. This startling conclusion will make The Genesis Enigma a must-read for believers and scientists alike.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

This book is written, therefore, to serve as a practical guide primarily for the physician but also for the nurse, the dietitian, and the medical administrator, who is confronted by religious beliefs and doctrinal habits with which he is unfamiliar. It is designed to provide a reference for questions of religious dogma as they pertain to the practice of medicine. My concern has been primarily with those present-day religious bodies which are sufficiently sizable to be encountered generally in the United States. Let me emphasize that the historical portions of this book are not intended to be complete, but are written simply to help the reader understand the present concepts from their origin, i.e., their genealogy. The text has been compiled impartially as a reference book, not a critique, and the manuscript has been read by leaders of each religious body. - Preface.

In this I Just Want You to Know Ebook, Kate reveals a grateful and faith-filled mother who only wants the best for her children and is willing to sacrifice to make that happen.  The story covers the three years her family lived in their Elizabethtown home, a period Kate considers one of the happiest of her life. In it she discusses the individuality of eight kids (all under the age of six) transitioning from the chaos of caring for infants to the structured days of a home filled with budding preschoolers, as well as her thoughts on communication, everyday miracles, and providing a safe home. During that time, Kate discusses her family's unique challenges from daily schedules to traveling, her need for control to learning how to be flexible, the individuality of all eight kids, how God provided every day, and her faith that held it all together.

In that remarkable letter, he wrote: “In more than one respect, I feel very lucky”; he went on to promise that he would sum up his thoughts on the topics that had been so pervasive in his work—love and death—in a final book. We are proud to offer that book here.Church has been justly celebrated as a writer of American history, but his works of spiritual guidance have been especially valued for their insight and inspiration. As a minister, Church defined religion as “our human response to the dual reality of being alive and having to die.” The goal of life, he tells us “is to live in such a way that our lives will prove worth dying for.” This last book in his impressive oeuvre is imbued with ideas and exemplars for achieving that goal. The stories he offers—drawn from his own experiences and from the lives of his friends, family, and parishioners—are both engrossing and enlightening. Forrest Church’s final work may be his most lasting gift to his readers.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Using an engaging combination of autobiographical vignettes, her experiences as a pastor, and biblical stories, Cook illustrates each step--and concludes each chapter with simple exercises and helpful suggestions for incorporating Moving Up's lessons into your own life.

Codes reveal the allegory of the soul that is embodied in the sonnets, with the higher soul represented by the young man and the lower soul represented by the Dark Lady, as outlined in Sonnet 144.    The central code is the very numbering of the sonnets, which, numbers translated into Hebrew letters (1=Aleph, 2=Beth, etc) spell Hebrew words which all too often dictate the theme of the sonnet, e.g., number 18 spell Hebrew word Chai, ""life,"" which is the subject of the poem.     The book analyzes each of the 154 poems to discern its meaning and the elements of the code represented within it.  All 154 sonnets are presented in the spelling and approximate layout of the original 1609 Publication.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Wendy lives for the next high on crack, oblivious to her boyfriend's love. Neil is dying of AIDS. These are the people of inner-city Toronto. Look into their distorted, obscure faces, their fractured lives, and catch a glimpse of the sublime. Greg Paul calls them tragic heroes--individuals who can offer a testament to God's love and mercy.With emotional depth and spiritual intensity, Greg's compelling stories reveal that people with desperate lives have precious lessons to teach us about the character of God. God in the Alley offers a profound message of grace and calling that each one of us needs to hear.""The experience of reading this book haunts, convicts, delights. But one thing is for sure: you don't want to miss it."" --Mark Buchanan, author of The Holy Wild: Trusting God in Everything""Greg Paul writes beautifully and welcomes us into the life he lives.... I am grateful to have read this book.""--David Wilcox, musician, songwriter, and storyteller""I dare you to read this book at more than one sitting.

She didn't pray or attend church services--she wasn't even sure she believed in God--but the simple phrase held a soothing power she couldn't deny. Unlike the prayers of her childhood with their vague references to forgiving trespasses and dying before you wake, this felt solid. I am here was incontestable, certain. You are here confirmed the existence of a world outside herself and eased the knot of isolation Lindsey had been carrying with her since the day her brother died.She soon found that she couldn't pray enough. She spoke to God; she questioned God; and as a result, she came to a deeper understanding of herself and the world around her. Prayer opened Crittenden up to the present and to those around her. It gave her strength when her mother, and then her father, became ill, and when her late brother's young son became increasingly hers to care for. But when a relationship went sour, prayer abandoned her. Or so it seemed, until she learned the most important lesson of all. Poignant, personal, and surprisingly honest, The Water Will Hold You is a skeptic's story as much as it is a believer's story. It explores the power of the ineffable through a compelling narrative of family, loss, and love. Lindsey Crittenden has emerged as a fresh new voice with a message to cross spiritual and religious lines: Faith is constant discovery.From the Hardcover edition.

How do the Ten Commandments inform everyday life? This encouraging new book introduces Christian ethics by showing readers that faithful moral living is achieved through the daily ""practice of piety."" Timothy Sedgwick explores the foundations of Christian ethics, as seen by both Catholics and Protestants, and develops a constructive view of morality as a way of life.

The first trend confirms the fact that many Western countries have become, over a long period of time, less strict about sacrilegious expression. In the process, many repealed their blasphemy laws or became less harsh in their punishment of blasphemy, hence “the fall of blasphemy law”.  The second trend manifests an opposite movement, hence “the rise of blasphemy law”. Over the last decades, namely, Western societies have witnessed multiple attempts to suppress speech that defames religion. To be sure, one particularly vicious way of re-energizing these interdicts against blasphemy has come from radical believers intent upon removing blasphemy from the public domain by violent means.

This book explores an explosion of scholarship in recent decades that has reopened questions once thought to be settled about the relationships between Nazism, Liberalism, and Christianity. In the process of criticizing the retrospective fallacy and urging a properly hermeneutical historiography, its method in historical theology causes us to reflect back upon our tacit commitments, suggesting that we are closer to fascism than we are aware and that, although the devil never shows its face twice in exactly the same way, the particular hubris of grasping after ""final solutions"" along biopolitical lines-that is, the ""racially scientific"" version of fascism that was Nazism-is and remains near at hand today, within our horizon of possibilities unrecognized in just the ways that it was unrecognized by Germans before Auschwitz. The book takes a fresh look at the theology of Adolf Hitler and finds themes that are disturbingly familiar. It summons to the renewal of Christian theology after Christendom in the form of critical dogmatics, where the motif of the Beloved Community replaces the fallen idol descended from Charlemagne.--Back cover.

Authors examine such subjects as painting from Dura-Europos, Hellenistic sculpture at Saqqara in Egypt, Roman cameo glass, Pompeian fresco, and aspects of Venus in portrait sculpture. The essays on Dura-Europos are especially valuable in light of the present turmoil in the region.Professor Downey's influence shines through in these discussions, which echo her mentorship of several generations of art history and archaeology students and recognize her scholarly achievements.

Discovering our Asian identity in the midst of Western culture means learning to bridge these and other conflicting values.

The authors represent a variety of perspectives, including the immigrant experience of a Korean man, a third-generation Japanese-American's understanding of his parents' experience in the internment camps during World War II, and a Chinese American woman's struggle to communicate with her parents.

Doubting His holiness? Thinking maybe you shouldn't completely surrender to Him, that you're better off in charge of your own life? Well, say hello to the father of these lies: Satan. He's an old pro using the same brilliant, deceptive tactics to harm you every time--unless you dare call his bluff and refuse to ever be his victim again. In God Can Not Be Trusted (and Five Other Lies of Satan), you'll discover how to recognize the devil's six ancient tactics, and claim victory over each one. Your only hope is in the power of Jesus Christ. Because only Christ can conquer Satan. He already has. So flood your mind with truth, and begin to see the lies for what they are. You'll never be duped by them again, free to live abundantly in light of God's truth! Have You Been Fooled?  God must be out to get me.  I'm better off doing my own thing.  Sure it's a sin, but I can get away with it!  Do you recognize these thoughts? Then you have been fooled. And Satan is laughing.  Because if he can deceive you, he will destroy your state of mind, ruin your relationships, and steal your joy. Do not let him.  Dr. Tony Evans equips you to recognize Satan's conniving tactics and boldly declare his lies for what they are. Winning this game is easier than you may think. And victorious living in light of God's truth is your daily reward!  Story Behind the BookA common theme emerged as Tony Evans held counseling sessions with countless individuals. People seemed completely unaware of how the spiritual realm was at work in their lives. ""They saw clearly with their physical eyes,"" he says, ""but remained unaware of the evil, unseen spiritual activity that either caused or aggravated their physical world. Even in my own life, when I faced challenges or struggles, I would often reference the physical system without first looking at the spiritual cause,"" says Tony. ""Thus this book's message was born to more effectively help people understand and address their struggles from a spiritual point of view.""From the Hardcover edition.

Cremo, who is not a professional scientist, presented at scientific and academic conferences. Versions of some of these papers have appeared in peer-reviewed academic publications. In these papers, Cremo explores the relationship between science and religion, in terms of his specific scientific and religious commitments.     Many of the papers in this book deal with archeological evidence for extreme human antiquity, consistent with the Puranic histories. Other papers explore the history of archeology in India.    In his book Human Devolution, Cremo presented a Vedic alternative to the current theory of human origins.     Some of the papers in My Science, My Religion are related to this topic.     This collection will be of interest to theologians, scientists, historians of science, philosophers of science, and scholars of science and religion.

But what about the accomplishments of those who have challenged religion? Traveling from classical Greece to twenty-first century America, Imagine There s No Heaven explores the role of disbelief in shaping Western civilization. At each juncture common themes emerge: by questioning the role of gods in the heavens or the role of a God in creating man on earth, nonbelievers help move science forward. By challenging the divine right of monarchs and the strictures of holy books, nonbelievers, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Denis Diderot, help expand human liberties, and influence the early founding of the United States. Revolutions in science, in politics, in philosophy, in art, and in psychology have been led, on multiple occasions, by those who are free of the constraints of religious life. Mitchell Stephens tells the often-courageous tales of history s most important atheists -- like Denis Diderot and Salman Rushdie. Stephens makes a strong and original case for their importance not only to today s New Atheist movement but to the way many of us -- believers and nonbelievers -- now think and live.""--Publisher's description.

At the end of that meeting, they asked me a question: would I be left behind? In other words, had I accepted Jesus as my savior or would I go to hell? This book represents the answer to that question.""Born again at age sixteen, John Marks later abandoned his faith. In Reasons to Believe he attempts to cross a deep cultural barrier to understand those who now condemn his way of life. He grapples with the message that millions of evangelicals attempt to deliver to their fellow citizens every day and speaks at length with missionaries, political activists, theologians, Christian musicians, and filmmakers—the rich and powerful, the poor and broken, and the pastors who have turned small congregations into megachurches.This is familiar and often comforting territory for Marks, and he still has a profound understanding of what it means to be an evangelical. In Reasons to Believe he presents this world from the inside out.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Yet whatever your inner calling, writes internationally renowned teacher Gloria Karpinski, you can benefit from the practical guidance of other seekers on how best to manifest your spiritual intentions in the nitty-gritty reality of everyday life.A new companion for traveling purposefully on the path, Barefoot on Holy Ground helps you learn how to call forth the good in every circumstance and use it to further your mission and consciousness. Through numerous enjoyable, effective exercises and meditations, you will learn how to integrate your inner and outer resources of mind, body, emotions, finances, and careers into your personal practice. This will free you to become a disciple--in the modern sense--to your own higher calling and service to the world.Drawing on the wisdom of ancient scriptures and contemporary thinkers from many world traditions, tapping into her own and other disciples' real-life stories and insights, Karpinski shares the Twelve Lessons of Spiritual Craftsmanship that are essential to the disciple's path.These easy-to-follow lessons are divided into three parts: Knowing the Way explores the ways we recognize and understand our mission through Knowledge, Revelation, Body Wisdom, and Discernment; Becoming the Way illuminates the fundamental building principles of strong discipleship: Love, Will, Faith, and Power; and Fulfilling the Way reveals the practical process through which we bring our journey to fruition by Creating, Transforming, Enduring, and Serving. Integration, balance, and wisdom are the benefits of the twelve lessons, the treasured syntheses of yin and yang, light and shadow, heaven and earth. Full of exciting, effective spiritual exercises, Barefoot on Holy Ground leads readers purposefully along the path to Conscious Evolution so that they can embrace their higher calling.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Is there something about the Islamic heritage that makes Muslims more likely than adherents of other faiths to invoke it in their political life? If so, what is it? Ancient Religions, Modern Politics seeks to answer these questions by examining the roles of Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity in modern political life, placing special emphasis on the relevance--or irrelevance--of their heritages to today's social and political concerns. Michael Cook takes an in-depth, comparative look at political identity, social values, attitudes to warfare, views about the role of religion in various cultural domains, and conceptions of the polity. In all these fields he finds that the Islamic heritage offers richer resources for those engaged in current politics than either the Hindu or the Christian heritages. He uses this finding to explain the fact that, despite the existence of Hindu and Christian counterparts to some aspects of Islamism, the phenomenon as a whole is unique in the world today. The book also shows that fundamentalism--in the sense of a determination to return to the original sources of the religion--is politically more adaptive for Muslims than it is for Hindus or Christians. A sweeping comparative analysis by one of the world's leading scholars of premodern Islam, Ancient Religions, Modern Politics sheds important light on the relationship between the foundational texts of these three great religious traditions and the politics of their followers today""--   Read more Read less",1 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It employs a socio-historical approach, together with insights from performance theory and feminist rhetorical analysis, to situate Tertullian's comments in the broader context of the Roman Empire, and to investigate them as evidence of the productive and disputed role clothing and adornment played in early Christian life and constructions of salvation""--  ""Why did the influential Christian thinker, Tertullian of Carthage (160-220 C.E.), while addressing the critical issue of salvation of the flesh, write about clothing? Why did he care what Christians wore? Carly Daniel-Hughes answers that in early Christian communities clothing tied to identity and theology. Placing Tertullian's writings in the Roman culture of dress, she shows that in them men's dress is used to envision Christian masculinity as non-Roman and anti-imperial. His concerns about women's dress, however, reveal internal Christian debates about the nature of the flesh and the possibility of its transformation in to a resurrected, glorious body""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

By designating basic human emotions as rasa, a word that connotes taste, flavor, or essence, Indian aesthetic theory conceptualizes emotional states as something to be savored. At their core, emotions can be tastes of the divine. In this book, the methods of the emerging discipline of comparative theology enable the author's appreciation of Hindu texts and practices to illuminate her Christian reflections on aesthetics and emotion.

"MINISTRY TO THE ILL, DYING AND BEREAVED: LAY PASTORAL CARE-GIVING FOR THE HOSPICE SETTING",Carolynne Marie Fairweather,religion,First published in 1995,/works/OL12280803W,/authors/OL5369913A/Carolynne_Marie_Fairweather,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1995|Pages 163,"This pre-pilot project supports the idea that a fifth certification in diaconal ministry at Drew University, Madison, N.J. (dealing with specialized care to the ill, dying and bereaved) is viable. Twelve lay pastoral care volunteers from Hospice of Morris County in Morristown, N.J., were trained to provide such a ministry to patients and families, as requested, on hospice service.  Training took place in a double-tracked format over a four week period during March and April, 1995. A total of fourteen hours of instruction in Judeo-Christian and other religious belief systems; an understanding of the spiritual issues facing hospice patients and families; a working knowledge of family dynamics; and a review of listening skills, bereavement issues and reporting documentation was taught.  All of the instruction was undergirded by a spiritual foundation in meditation, poetry, music and relaxation technique. A six hour retreat was also part of the course, enabling participants to express and understand their own spiritual natures and gifts for this type of ministry. Continuing support/supervision groups have helped participants to learn, share and grow from each other.  Through the use of course evaluations and talking with the participants, ten of the twelve expressed a definite interest in further training at Drew University's diaconal ministry program and would be viable candidates for such a course, if offered. As a result of this project, it would seem that Drew University could become the first seminary in the country to offer certification in ministry to the ill, dying and bereaved.

SPIRITUAL CARE GIVEN BY NURSES AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING OF TERMINALLY ILL CANCER PATIENTS,Patricia Sanders Broten,religion,First published in 1991,/works/OL12268235W,/authors/OL5360004A/Patricia_Sanders_Broten,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 1991|Pages 289,"The purposes of this study were to explore: (1) cancer patients' perceptions of spiritual care given by nurses, (2) the documentation on records of the provision of care, and (3) the relationship of spiritual care provided to the spiritual well-being of patients.  Forty terminally ill cancer patients hospitalized on oncology units at three medical centers were surveyed about the nature and scope of spiritual care provided by nurses and others, and their perceptions of their spiritual well-being. Data were collected by trained registered nurses who administered two questionnaires to which patients responded orally.  The following is the list of spiritual care interventions and the percentages of subjects who reported receiving them: encourage patient to talk about hopes and dreams (72.5%), talked to patient about God (67.5%), read Scripture (65%), listened to patient talk about God (60%), talked about religious beliefs (62.5%), assured patient presence of Supreme Being (72.5%), prayed for patient (92.5%), and provided materials which lift the spirits (60%). Nurses, along with pastoral care representatives, family, and friends were reported to have provided each of these interventions. Thirty-five percent of those who did not receive the interventions said it was important for a nurse to provide the care.  Records showed that there was limited documentation of spiritual care given, even though patients reported that nurses had provided care. Documentation which did exist was generally referenced to the patient's religion or choice of clergy. Spiritual well-being was assessed on two dimensions: (1) traditional religious aspects, and (2) existential aspects with no particular religion basis. Patients scored higher on the measures of religious well-being than they did on the existential measures which referred to more general satisfaction with the purpose and meaning of life.  A trend which emerged was that frequency of spiritual care intervention decreased with age. Patients reported that nurses were often too busy to provide spiritual care. The study was limited by the inability to obtain the number of subjects originally proposes. Patients were either too ill to participate in the study, or they had narcotic therapy initiated during the first 48 hours hospitalized.

Through the prisms of archaeology, theology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright's findings overturn basic assumptions about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and are sure to cause controversy. He explains why spirituality has a role today, and why science, contrary to conventional wisdom, affirms the validity of the religious quest. And this previously unrecognized evolutionary logic points not toward continued religious extremism, but future harmony. Nearly a decade in the making, The Evolution of God is a breathtaking re-examination of the past, and a visionary look forward.   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

That much is clear if we look at its leading artists: Frans Hals was Reformed, Jan Steen en Johannes Vermeer were Catholic, and Rembrandt was not tied to any church. They all sold their work to patrons from wide-ranging religious backgrounds. Only the Reformed Church was recognised by the authorities, but many other religious thrived behind closed doors. This book sheds light on how government and the public worked together to resolve a new dilemma: how can peace be maintained in a country with a variety of religious groups, each of which believes it has a monopoly on the truth?

By focusing on the IAHR membership of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1957, the book reconsiders the impact of the Iron Curtain. Valerio Severino examines unpublished international correspondences, bureaucratic requests, confidential reports submitted by the delegates after their participation in congresses in Western Europe and the USA. Facts and insights about leading Hungarian scholars and internal processes of the IAHR are reconstructed in detail. Through doing so, Severino is able to evaluate the permeability of the Iron Curtain, the exchange of knowledge between the opposing blocs, the ideological control exercised through the Academy and the ways in which academics subjected their work to this obligation""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The politician would touch the feet of the priest and the priest enforced a certain kind of society on people – all in the name of God. Osho makes a strong point that the discussion about belief or disbelief in god is a dead end in itself. Not believing, but only experiencing is a way of finding truth and meaning. While Friedrich Nietzsche’s declaration that “God is Dead, therefore man is free” has been an incredible step in understanding – it is in itself a negative solution and does not bring freedom. Simply removing God is not enough to achieve freedom. The atheistic philosophy of Communism has shown the endless abyss of meaninglessness – a vacuum that will be again and again filled with false meaning. Osho offers something of which Nietzsche was unaware – meditation – a direct connection with existence itself. Zen and meditation allow us to find meaning and significance, creativity, receptivity and a path to freedom. Zen has no God, but it has a tremendous science to transform our consciousness, to bring so much awareness that it is impossible to commit evil. But it is not imposed through commandments; it comes rather from our innermost being and understanding. Reading this book will be a transforming experience, making you aware of the incredible responsibility we have as human beings for ourselves and our environment of which we are part – here – and now.

These communities challenge the inevitability and morality of dominant political and economic models.  By putting utopian religious ethics intopractice, they attest to the real possibility of social alternatives. In Seeds of the Kingdom, Anna L. Peterson reflects on the experiences of two very different communities, one inhabited by impoverished former refugees in the mountains of El Salvador and the other by Amish farmers in theMidwestern U.S. What makes these groups stand out among advocates of environmental protection, political justice, and sustainable development is their religious orientation. They aim, without apology, to embody the reign of God on earth...   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Christie McNally, a renowned master teacher and lecturer who has studied with some of the greatest Indian, Tibetan, and western Buddhist masters, explains the central tenets of Buddhism and reveals how they apply to everyday life. Combining ancient wisdom and contemporary teachings, she leads readers along the path to a richer, fuller life through resonant examples and eye-opening insights.Her engaging tone and fresh approach to the art of meditation will appeal to followers of Pema Chodron and to readers of Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzberg, and Jon Kabat-Zinn.

As Victor Schlatter follows the fallout from that fatal bite, we find two streams of destiny flowing all the way into the 21 st century. The first was the Hebraic bedrock on which the Judeo-Christian standards were once founded; the challenger is the worldview of the ancient Greeks, which has formatted the mindset of the Western world—the very mindset that has become so familiar to the self-centered culture that swirls around us today. No less probing than it was in the Garden that dripped with dew and daisies, Who is it that has been whispering that all may not be well as we stand stripped of our humanistic self-confidence in a society that has long since forgotten how to blush?

There is glory in every tree and flower. There is the splendor in the rising and setting sun. Every living creature reflects its own glory. Man in his own way through his actions and character expresses an essence of glory. But the glory that we see in Creation is but the barest reflection of the greater glory of the Creator. Dr. Munroe surgically removes the religious rhetoric out of this most oft used word, replacing it with words that will draw you into the powerful Presence of the Lord. The Glory of Living not only introduces you to the power of the glory but also practically demonstrates how God longs to see His glory reflected through man.

His letters were among the earliest documents to be included in the New Testament and, as such, they shaped Christian thinking from the beginning. As a missionary, theologian and pastor Paul's own wrestling with theological and ethical questions of his day is paradigmatic for Christian theology, not least for Christianity's own identity and continuing relationship with Judaism. The Cambridge Companion to St Paul provides an important assessment of this apostle and a fresh appreciation of his continuing significance today. With eighteen chapters written by a team of leading international specialists on Paul, the Companion provides a sympathetic and critical overview of the apostle, covering his life and work, his letters and his theology. The volume will provide an invaluable starting point and helpful cross check for subsequent studies.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ist es nicht gewagt, den kategorischen Imperativ von Marx mit einer Zeile aus dem »Magnificat« des Lukas-Evangeliums zusammenzubringen? Wenn anlässlich des 200. Geburtstages von Marx aus christlicher und theologischer Perspektive auf ein gemeinsames Erbe verwiesen wird, dann gibt es dafür gute Gründe: Gerechtigkeitstraditionen in der Bibel und bei Marx, Analogien zwischen dem Fetischbegriff und der biblischen Götzenkritik.  Hinzu kommt die Praxis der religiösen und katholischen Sozialisten, Allianzen von Christ*innen und Marxist*innen in den Befreiungsbewegungen in Lateinamerika, Afrika, Asien und auch Europa. Allen gemeinsam geht es um solidarischen Umgang mit Migra­tio­n, gegen soziale Ungleichheit, Krieg und die Zerstörung des Planeten Erde – und um die Überwindung des Kapitalismus.

The time it takes to make a decision. That's all that lies between settling for 'Whatever' ... or insisting on 'Whatever it takes.'  3 Seconds shows how to unleash the inner resources that can move you to a whole new level of success. It comes down to six predictable impulses that most of us automatically accept without a second thought. You can replace them with new impulses that lead toward impact and significance. For instance, it takes Three Seconds to ...  Disown Your Helplessness: The First Impulse: 'There's nothing I can do about it.' The Second Impulse: 'I can't do everything, but I can do something.'  Quit Stewing and Start Doing: The First Impulse: 'Someday I'm going to do that.' The Second Impulse: 'I'm diving in ... starting today.'  Fuel Your Passion: The First Impulse: 'I'll do what happens to come my way.' The Second Impulse: 'I'll do what I'm designed to do.'  Inhale ... exhale ... the difference of your lifetime can begin in the space of a single breath. The decision is yours. Start today.

Developments in physics, biology and the neurosciences have reinvigorated discussions about the nature of life and ultimate reality. At the same time, the growth of anti-evolutionary and intelligent design movements has led many to the view that science and religion are necessarily in conflict. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the relations between science and religion, with contributions from historians, philosophers, scientists and theologians. It explores the impact of religion on the origins and development of science, religious reactions to Darwinism, and the link between science and secularization. It also offers in-depth discussions of contemporary issues, with perspectives from cosmology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and bioethics. The volume is rounded out with philosophical reflections on the connections between atheism and science, the nature of scientific and religious knowledge, and divine action and human freedom""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

If someone were to ask you that question, do you have, and could you respond with, a compelling answer? The Bible says Jesus died on a cross to forgive men of their sins. Why did He have to die, and why does His death forgive us? How can we know if what the Bible says is true? Altar'd provides inspiring, historic, faith-building evidence, revealing how God fulfilled His own rules and master plan to restore his people to relationship with Him through the sacrifice of his son, Jesus. Many powerful forms of evidence are displayed that will help fan into flame the faith of all who read. Many people believe faith is some type of mystical thing that one simply believes ""because they believe."" The truth is that many people we care about need evidence, which can then lead to real, lasting faith. Altar'd provides evidence that reveals God is real, the Bible can be trusted, and that He has a plan for your life. Jesus offered his all on the cross, and our proper response is to offer our lives as ""a living sacrifice"" to him. This is what it means to be Altar'd. Have you Altar'd your life?

Youth ministries adapted and responded to the first two shifts, but we're missing the boat on the third. The result? Youth ministry isn't addressing the realities and needs of today's youth culture.  After nearly three decades in youth ministry, Mark Oestreicher has lived through a lot of those shifts himself. In recent years, he's found himself wondering what needs to change, especially since so much of what we're doing in youth ministry today is not working.  In Youth Ministry 3.0, youth workers will explore, along with Marko and the voices of other youth workers, why we need change in youth ministry, from a ministry moving away from a dependence on programs, to one that is focused on communion and mission. They'll get a quick history of youth ministry over the last fifty years. And they'll help dream about what changes need to take place in order to create the next phase of youth ministry---the future that needs to be created for effective ministry to students.

In this ebook, Dr. Ken 'Hutch' Hutcherson offers it to them. The former NFL player, now a pastor, sought-after speaker, and cancer patient, uses penetrating insight rooted in biblical truth to show that real hope comes through understanding and trusting a God who cares more about our character than our comfort. Weaving his story of living well with terminal illness, while opening a window into the lives of other ordinary people, Hutch sheds new light on coping with tough times, tragedy, and personal adversity. Readers will find that Hope Is Contagious is practical yet inspiring for not merely surviving in turbulent times, but in celebrating, even savoring, every moment.

No one questions these things. However, there is another fundamental requirement without which no ministry can thrive or sustain itself for the long haul---and too often it is either ignored or disregarded, especially by those in Christian ministry.  According to Andy Stanley, that fundamental requirement is systems---communication systems, decision-making systems, budgeting systems, programming systems, structural systems and more. And it is systems, perhaps more than anything else, that determine what happens---or fails to happen---in an organization. Stanley writes, 'You can pray your heart out, fast your heart out, commit your heart out and surrender your heart out to initiate change or launch a new ministry, but if you fail to address your systems, there will be no change and your ministry will not thrive. It's not because God is not interested or you're not spiritual, it's because God works through systems. Every time God creates something, there is something systematic and predictable about it. That doesn't make God predictable or small; it's just how God operates.'   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Look Unto Me offers 366 of Spurgeon's most powerful devotions, modernizing the language without changing the meaning and adding Scripture references and quotes in the NIV.  Jim Reimann, editor of updated editions of Streams in the Desert and My Utmost for His Highest, has also added thought-provoking comments to deepen your understanding of the text, other Scriptures to consider, as well as application and closing prayers. This new edition also includes these new features:     Scripture quotes referenced in the context of each devotion     Scripture and subject indexes     Hymn quotes referenced with composer names and dates  The material is profound, thought-provoking, and life-changing, but easy to follow.

In this comparative study, at once historical and anthropological, Peel explores the intertwined character of the three religions and the dense imbrication of religion in all aspects of Yoruba history up to the present. For over 400 years, the Yoruba have straddled two geocultural spheres: one reaching north over the Sahara to the world of Islam, the other linking them to the Euro-American world via the Atlantic. These two external spheres were the source of contrasting cultural influences, notably those emanating from the world religions. However, the Yoruba not only imported Islam and Christianity but also exported their own ori?a religion to the New World. Before the voluntary modern diaspora that has brought many Yoruba to Europe and the Americas, tens of thousands were sold as slaves in the New World, bringing with them the worship of the ori?a. Peel offers deep insight into important contemporary themes such as religious conversion, new religious movements, relations between world religions, the conditions of religious violence, the transnational flows of contemporary religion, and the interplay between tradition and the demands of an ever-changing present. In the process, he makes a major theoretical contribution to the anthropology of world religions.""   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Through his commentaries on such books as the I Ching and The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and various essays on Zen, eastern meditation, and the symbolism of the mandala, Jung attempted to build a bridge of understanding between western psychology and the practices and beliefs of Asian religions, and thereby to relate traditional eastern thought to contemporary western concerns.This book offers a critical examination of this remarkable piece of intellectual bridge building: first by assessing its role in the development of Jung's own thinking on the human psyche; second by discussing its relationship to the wider dialogue between east and west; and third by examining it in the light of urgent contemporary concerns and debates about intercultural understanding.

This has been a controversial debate ever since Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859. Invariably, the source of controversy has been design. Is the appearance of design in organisms as exhibited in their functional complexity the result of purely natural forces acting without prevision or teleology? Or does the appearance of design signify genuine prevision and teleology, and, if so, is that design empirically detectable and thus open to scientific inquiry? Four main positions have emerged in response to these questions: Darwinism, self-organization, theistic evolution, and intelligent design."" ""In this survey, leading figures in the debate argue for their respective positions in a nontechnical, accessible style. Readers are thus invited to draw their own conclusions.

What they pictured was a society free from the negative influ-    ences of religious institutions that had become the lapdogs of the European    power elite. Before the Russian Revolution, Russian Marxists saw the    Russian Orthodox Church as defending and blessing a tyrannical political    leadership and supporting a morally unjustified war effort. Revolution-    aries viewed religious institutions as the source of the twisted moral ideol-    ogy that defended an inherently immoral social and political system. Their    dreams of secularization were premised on a desire to rid the world of all    that was harmful to the struggling and exploited masses of humanity.    By the end of the Russian Revolution, Bolshevik leaders had achieved    something astonishing. For the first time in history, Marxist theorists    gained control over millions of people and found themselves finally able    to implement their dreams. Karl Marx had initially raised the battle cry    for a new brand of social activism, urging intellectuals to turn their    thoughts into action. Radical members of the Russian intelligentsia fer-    vently took up the cause, and after decades of fomenting rebellion, for-    merly marginal, exiled, and basement-dwelling revolutionaries took    charge of one of the largest countries on earth. Their plans were vast, and    with the collapse of the czarist regime, Bolsheviks fortified their utopian    dream to alter every aspect of society. They now debated about how they    would eliminate private property, restructure the economy, and produce    a Communist culture with a new set of values, beliefs, and identities.    The importance of the cultural aspect of the Soviet project cannot be    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 22    Copyrighted    Material    overestimated. As Khrushchev reaffirmed nearly four decades after the rev-    olution, “It is the function of all ideological work of our Party and State to    develop new traits in Soviet people, to train them in collectivism and love    of work, in proletarian internationalism and patriotism, in lofty ethical    principles of the new society, Marxism-Leninism.”    1    Central to this utopian    goal of the new Soviet culture was the elimination of former ideological    and religious loyalties. Religion proved one of the most challenging rivals    because it existed at every level of society, from nationwide church hierar-    chies to local clerics with personal ties to their congregations, and from    nationally celebrated religious festivals to daily rituals performed in the pri-    vacy of one’s home. The complete secularization of society was a daunting    task, but Bolshevik leaders were confident that they would succeed.    According to the early Marxist-Leninist secularization dream, religion    was a castle made of sand. As the waves of social and political change    washed across its base, Bolsheviks believed that religion would collapse    under its own weight and be washed away without a trace. But this secu-    larization dream was much more ambitious than most scholarly concep-    tions of secularization stipulate. Secularization, in contemporary social    science literature, normally refers to a number of distinct events relating to    a general weakening of religious institutions. David Martin, in his work    A    General Theory of Secularization,    indicates that secularization tendencies    include (1) the deterioration of religious institutions, (2) the decline of reli-    gious practices, (3) the erosion of stable religious communities, and (4) the    differentiation of churches from other institutional spheres.    2    Clearly, the    tendencies toward secularization make no direct reference to religious    faith, but Marxist-Leninists assumed that religious belief would naturally    disappear with the process of institutional secularization. And this general    assumption continues to confound contemporary debates about secular-    ization, in which some scholars point to the decline of religious organiza-    tions as confirmation of religious decline while others note the persistence    of religious belief as evidence to the contrary.    3    But as the Soviet Union systematically enacted new religious policies,    Communist Party leaders discovered that the banning of religious activi-    ties along with the forced destruction of religious institutions could actu-    ally inspire religious belief through opposition to a perceived injustice.    Consequently, the deterioration of religious institutions, the decline of    religious practices, the erosion of religious communities, and the differ-    entiation of religious and secular spheres did    not    produce widespread    religious disbelief. As Yaroslavsky, head of the League of Militant Atheists,    noted to Stalin in the early 1930s, “Religion is like a nail, the harder you    Dreams of Secularization    23    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 23    Copyrighted    Material    24    Dreams of Secularization    hit it the deeper it goes.”    4    Yaroslavsky’s quip advanced the idea that reli-    gion was not merely a collection of institutions or rituals but instead an    ideological conviction embedded within a larger culture.    The creation of the League of Militant Atheists, a churchlike atheist    propaganda organization, marked the beginning of an emerging Soviet    theory of religion. Communist Party theorists, especially Yaroslavsky,    argued that religion constituted a worldview or set of moral beliefs that    lie in the hearts of individuals but are propagated by religious institutions    and instilled through religious practices. From this perspective, secular-    ization was nothing less than the eradication of religious faith. In the    1920s and 1930s, Yaroslavsky was given the daunting task of seculariz-    ing all of Soviet culture. And because Yaroslavsky and his colleagues    were committed Marxist-Leninists, they were careful to lay out the philo-    sophical assertions that guided their plans.    Even though the theories of Yaroslavsky and the atheist propagandists    who would follow him were broad in their scope and certainly single-    minded in their intent, much of their content reflects hypotheses that are    still popular in the social sciences today. Consequently, the secularization    strategies of the Soviet era produced a rich laboratory full of data from    which to test a wide range of pertinent sociological hypotheses. Overall,    the Soviet Secularization Experiment employed and tested six key theoret-    ical assertions concerning the substance and persistence of religion. Not all    of these assertions are logically derived from the ideology of Marxist-    Leninism, but, nonetheless, Soviet policies addressed their validity.    In sum, the Secularization Experiment tested the extent to which reli-    gious vitality or decline are a product of ignorance, ritual activity, social    institutions, social rewards, salvation incentives, and church-state rela-    tionships. The following chapter investigates the substance of these six    assertions in greater depth.    Secularization Assertions    Assertion 1    Religion is but the false sun which revolves around man    while he is not yet fully self-aware.    — Karl Marx    In 1549, Lelio Sozzini wrote to John Calvin that “most of my friends are    so well educated they can scarcely believe God exists.”    5    The idea that    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 24    Copyrighted    Material    Dreams of Secularization    25    enlightened minds are naturally adverse to religious belief is not a new    one. Antireligious intellectual movements have a lengthy history that    most clearly dates back to ancient Greek philosophers, who questioned    the existence of the gods. In the fifth century, Xenophanes, as translated    by George Henry Lewes, concluded, “God, the infinite, could not be    infinite, neither could He be finite.”    6    Sharing his discovery, Xenophanes    toured cities and the countryside explaining to spectators how logic    proves that the supernatural is meaningless.    Although skeptics throughout the ages certainly applied logic, sci-    ence, and common sense to question the tenets of religious belief,    progress in science and the rise of liberal thought in the modern era did    little to bolster empirical claims for atheism. For instance, Newton’s    theory of gravity was initially understood as support for the existence of    an active God because “it involved the rejection of all purely mechanical    explanations of the movement of the heavens.”    7    And even though many    modern revolutionaries proclaimed an active tension between liberalism    and religious faith, Rousseau, the intellectual guru of the French Rev-    lution, was an active theist and in fact believed that social change    required the assistance of God. Intellectual traditions that posited that    science and liberalism are at war with religion have always existed    alongside scientists and revolutionaries who were religious. Therefore,    the empowerment of antireligious ideology requires a sociological    explanation because it was by no means a philosophically necessary    outcome of modern worldviews.    The sociologist Auguste Comte believed that religion would slowly    erode as technology and modern thinking penetrated popular culture; in    fact, he argued that sociology would replace religion as a way to not only    understand society but to also determine common moral attitudes con-    cerning behavior and the social order.    8    Although contemporary sociolo-    gists of religion no longer make this claim, the argument that the process    of modernization itself diminishes religion remains. But what is it about    modernization that is so incompatible with religion?    The history of Western Europe indicates that modernizing countries are    more likely to develop distinct religious and secular spheres—in other    words, they become societies in which the church is formally separated    from the state. Both Max Weber and Emile Durkheim believed this was    the result of a natural division of labor as societies got more complex and    bureaucratic. Nevertheless, if modernization erodes religious belief,    aspects of modernization such as urbanization, industrialization and sci-    entific advancement must also undermine religious views of the world.    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 25    Copyrighted    Material    The separation of church and state by itself does not logically lead to non-    belief. Therefore, modernization can only affect religious faith if modern    political and scientific worldviews are inherently antireligious or atheistic.    Following Marx, early Communist Party leaders subscribed to this    belief and assumed that modernizing the regions of the Soviet Union and    educating the population in the basic tenets of science would speed up    the inevitable process of secularization. From their perspective, technol-    ogy and science were wholly incompatible with beliefs in the supernatu-    ral—Marxist-Leninists assumed that individuals would have to choose    one in the final analysis. And as the advantages of modernization and the    logic of science became apparent, they supposed that all rational individ-    uals would abandon religion.    Industrial and urban growth followed quickly from the implementa-    tion of Soviet economic plans. And after World War II, the space and    arms races between the United States and the Soviet Union demonstrated    that the Soviet system enjoyed a high level of technological advancement    and industrial might. In addition, Soviet officials successfully put into    practice a massive educational effort that brought schools, books, and    educational materials to tens of millions of children for the first time. As    a professor from Moscow State University explained, “Soviet education    aims at creating human beings, grounded in a scientific, materialistic    outlook, people who endeavor to make life happy in this world rather    than in some world to come.”    9    This educational program explicitly com-    municated that technological and scientific advancements disproved reli-    gious systems of belief. A curriculum of “scientific atheism” became cen-    tral in the education of youth, scientists, and scholars. Soviet citizens    learned that religious belief was tantamount to scientific ignorance. If the    Soviet people were to enter a modern age of Communism, they were told    that they needed to abandon their antiquated ideas. With the weapons of    modern science, technology, and industrialization, early Communist    Party leaders fully expected to eliminate all traces of religious belief from    society.    The Secularization Experiment represents the first time in history that    the belief that science and modernity undermine religion became official    state ideology. As such, Soviet policy tested Marx’s assertion that educa-    tion and self-awareness will ultimately extinguish the false sun of reli-    gion. Subsequent chapters will uncover the extent to which Soviet citi-    zens were persuaded to discard their religious sentiments as antireligious    philosophy came to dominate their intellectual, academic, and profes-    sional lives.    26    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 26    Copyrighted    Material    Assertion 2    There are rites without gods, and indeed rites from    which gods derive.    —Emile Durkheim,    The Elementary Forms of Religious Life    Emile Durkheim maintained, “Religious beliefs rest upon a specific expe-    rience whose demonstrative value is, in one sense, not one bit inferior to    that of scientific experiments, though different from them.”    10    The experi-    ence to which Durkheim refers is the feeling of “collective effervescence,”    an intense emotional response to ritualistic interaction. Through partici-    pation in ritual, individuals feed off the fervor of other participants to cre-    ate a general enthusiasm that an individual could not attain in isolation.    The intensity of this collectively generated emotion can produce a wide of    range of thoughts and perceptions, from strident senses of nationalism    and group solidarity to, in the case of religious rituals, firm convictions of    religious devotion. For Durkheim, ritual activities produce religious faith    as individuals elicit from one another powerful feelings that later get    ascribed to some external force. In sum, Durkheim believed that social    ecstasy is misperceived by the individual as mystical experience.    Communist Party officials became increasingly concerned with reli-    gious ritual activity as religious practices persisted, even as many religious    organizations dissolved. While Soviet elites were certainly not Durk-    heimian in their philosophical worldview, they began to view ritual as a    key aspect of religious perseverance and concluded that public and pri-    vate religious rituals must be ended. Nonetheless, Communist Party lead-    ers sensed that ritualistic activity was a necessary and potentially produc-    tive aspect of human expression. So instead of attempting to eliminate all    ritual activity, they sought to replace religious rituals with Soviet ones.    In their blatant attempt to manufacture new rituals, Soviet officials    revealed certain Durkheimian assumptions concerning the substance of    rituals. Durkheim supposed that the beliefs that explain the meaning and    purpose of rituals are secondary. Specifically, religious beliefs are simply    an explanatory system that provided a framework from which the indi-    vidual describes her experience after the fact. William James noted how    religious experiences, while physiologically and emotionally very similar,    are explained in the language of the individual’s cultural environment. For    instance, Muslims will attribute their experience to Allah, while Christians    might believe that Jesus spoke to them. If beliefs about a religious experi-    Dreams of Secularization    27    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 27    Copyrighted    Material    ence were transposed onto a universal feeling of social solidarity, Soviets    could retain the social and emotional element of religious practices while    replacing the symbolic and ideological elements of the ritual. Individuals    would continue to experience the emotional power of religious rituals    but reattribute their feelings to the effects of Communism.    Simply put, Communist Party leaders hoped to connect Communist    symbols and ideology to experiences of “collective effervescence.” The    end result would be a population that no longer worshiped God but    instead revered the Soviet system with religiouslike devotion. In actuality,    Soviet elites hoped to realize something that Durkheim only believed to be    true. Namely, they were going to replace the false object of ritual activity,    God, with the true object, Society. In this way, rituals would continue to    promote social solidarity but no longer under the guise of a false ideology.    Actual Communist rituals reveal the simplicity of this plan. Soviet    officials quite consciously mimicked many aspects of common religious    ceremonies and plainly replaced certain phrases and symbols with    Communist alternatives. For instance, “God” is replaced by “the prole-    tariat” in texts, and the hammer and sickle stand in for the cross as    emblems of the sacred. Soviet weddings, funerals, confirmations, bap-    tisms, festivals, and national holidays were intended to create a new    faith—a faith in Soviet Communism. This is why many scholars of the    Soviet Union observe that Soviet Communism was its own religion. But    in the minds of Communist Party leaders, Soviet rituals were the antithe-    sis of religion because they removed God from the explanatory scheme.    The Secularization Experiment tested Durkheim’s assertion that ritu-    als inspire social solidarity through a collective focus on God but, alter-    natively, do not require God. Subsequent chapters investigate the extent    to which Soviet ritual activities inspired citizens to abandon centuries-old    religious rites and traditions.    Assertion 3    Bishops and archbishops enjoy authority merely as    deputies of the temporal power.    — Leon Trotsky,    The History of the Russian Revolution    Religious institutions—churches, mosques, temples, synagogues, spiri-    tual organizations, religious schools, and religious courts—provide an    organizational structure to perpetuate religious belief and commitment.    These institutions strive to attract and retain members and maintain loy-    28    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 28    Copyrighted    Material    alty to their religious message and mission. Individuals are committed to    religious organizations for a number of reasons. A common view of reli-    gious commitment holds that individuals are mainly socialized into a    religious community. They learn as children to attend church or partici-    pate in an accepted religious practice. Through this socialization, indi-    viduals may internalize religious ideas or simply continue religious    behavior out of habit. Alternatively, people may also accept religious    institutions out of fear of sanctions from religious authorities.    From a Marxist-Leninist perspective, religious institutions ultimately    justify current power relations and provide an otherworldly object at    which to direct individual problems and personal requests. In return,    political structures support and bolster the influence of religious institu-    tions. Marxist-Leninists viewed the institution of religion within this    mutually beneficial relationship as merely one propaganda arm of the    larger political structure. As such, they expected that religion would die    without the continued support and favoritism of the power elite.    In Russia, Marxist-Leninists argued, the Russian Orthodox Church    only legitimated czarist rule and offered little material assistance to the    population. By destroying the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet leaders    felt they could break the cycle of religious socialization that had survived    through official state propagation. Emelian Yaroslavsky, the Soviet min-    ister of antireligious propaganda, explained, “The Party strives for the    complete dissolution of the ties between the exploiting classes and the    organizations of religious propaganda.”    11    Marxist-Leninists assumed    that without state support, religious institutions would collapse and indi-    viduals would naturally drift toward nonbelief. They also assumed that    the ideological dominance of Roman Catholicism in Lithuania, Christian    Orthodoxy in the territories around Russia, and Islam in Central Asia    would fade as the religious institutions in these regions buckled under    state regulation.    The campaign to annihilate religious institutions was massive and    quite brutal. Within a mere decade, Soviet forces had destroyed or over-    taken most of the property holdings and buildings of the dominant reli-    gions throughout the Soviet Union. In addition, Soviet officials closed    Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Islamic schools and completely shut    down the Islamic court system throughout Central Asia. Before Soviet    rule, dominant religious groups in the various regions of the Russian    empire enjoyed governmental support and protection. They ran state-    funded institutions, oversaw most cultural events, and provided national    ceremonies and political legitimation. Consequently, citizens became    Dreams of Secularization    29    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 29    Copyrighted    Material    accustomed to a society in which religion was a recognized feature of    their daily experiences. Soviet rule changed this dramatically. No longer    did dominant religious institutions bask in the favoritism of political    elites; now, they were forced to fight for their very existence.    According to Trotsky’s assertion, bishops and archbishops would lose    sway without the continued support of the temporal authority. The    Secularization Experiment tested the mettle of religious organizations    across the Soviet Union, and, as we will see, some proved more resilient    than others.    Assertion 4    Religious or magical behavior or thinking must not be    set apart from the range of everyday purposive conduct,    particularly since even the ends of the religious and    magical actions are predominantly economic.    —Max Weber,    Economy and Society    In contrast to theories of religious persistence that stress the cultural, rit-    ual, and institutional socialization of individuals toward a religious    worldview, contemporary social theorists have explored the role of    rational calculations in religious decision making. While individuals are    certainly socialized into particular beliefs and worldviews, they may also    ponder ideas presented to them, weighing explanations of the world    against personal experiences and desires. Individuals may alter their    political opinions and religious beliefs as they learn more about the    world or develop different social ties through interaction with new    friends, neighbors, and coworkers. Within the boundaries of our cultural    environment, we are exploratory beings. As such, Max Weber, along    with more contemporary economic and social theorists, posited that indi-    viduals will make decisions in their own interests; this is often referred to    as the assumption of rational choice. For instance, a person is unlikely to    espouse a belief system that condemns an activity in which she is repeat-    edly engaged. While the instance of an individual directly undermining    her own goals is not impossible, it is certainly an anomaly and more suit-    ably the topic of abnormal psychology. Therefore, rational choice theo-    rists expect individuals, en masse, to behave and state beliefs in ways that    are personally advantageous.    From this perspective, individuals openly ponder the advantages to    religious behavior and belief. In cost-benefit terms, social rewards are a    30    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 30    Copyrighted    Material    clear and common advantage to religious participation. As an active    member of a religious community, one reaps a number of valuable social    rewards—companionship, access to social networks, and social status,    to name a few. Churchgoers often find spouses, employment, and sources    of important information through their church community, have support    from other church members if they fall ill or find themselves in need of    assistance, and are generally perceived as respectable members of society.    Therefore, religious participation can be quite rewarding socially and    economically.    While social rewards might explain why individuals participate in reli-    gious organizations, they say little about religious belief. Namely, one can    participate and reap rewards without actually believing in religious ideas.    These types of religious participants are referred to as    free riders    —like    bus riders who have not bought a ticket and attempt to ride for free—    because they seek the social rewards of religious participation while    shirking true commitment to the group and the belief system. In times of    need or when religious membership becomes detrimental, free riders will    abandon their group because they have no deep investment in the ideas    or members of the group. Before Soviet rule, it is difficult to know how    many fervent religious believers existed in the regions that would make    up the Soviet Union. Most individuals were affiliated with a certain reli-    gious tradition, but because state-supported religions were culturally    ubiquitous in Russia and the surrounding areas, it is unclear whether reli-    gious identities were simply ethnic and national labels or indicative of a    deep devotion to religious concepts. In the nineteenth century, Russian    intellectuals debated the extent to which the Russian people were com-    prised mainly of religious free riders or faithful believers who would    fight and die for their convictions. In one heated debate, the author    Nikolai Gogol asserted that the Russian population was deeply spiritual    while the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky objected. Belinsky wrote    Gogol, “In your opinion, the Russian people are the most religious in the    world. This is a lie! The basis of religiousness is pietism, reverence, fear    of God. But the Russian pronounces the name of God while scratch-    ing. . . . Look closer and you will see that it is by nature a profoundly    atheist people.”    12    According to Belinsky, Russian religiosity was a mean-    ingless facade that would fall away when religious habits became social    liabilities. Community Party elites would test this idea.    The Secularization Experiment radically altered the social rewards of    religious participation. In a complete reversal of past expectations, reli-    gious believers could be denied career promotion, could be harassed at    Dreams of Secularization    31    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 31    Copyrighted    Material    work or school, and, in the most extreme cases, could be imprisoned in    labor camps or psychiatric wards and sometimes executed for their faith.    Under these circumstances, religious free riders would be expected to jump    ship because religious organizations could no longer offer any benefits for    membership and social expectations would no longer urge religious par-    ticipation. Antireligious repression, at the very least, rid religious groups of    free riders. Anyone who remained openly religious in the Soviet system    demonstrated that their commitment to their faith did not depend on    social rewards. Soviets expected that few religious adherents would turn    out to be true believers once social incentives no longer existed.    To augment the harsh costs of religious commitment, Soviet society    offered social incentives to adopt the official ideology of the Soviet state    and become atheist. For this reason, individuals had many reasons to fal-    sify their religious beliefs and fake commitment to the Communist proj-    ect: to avoid discrimination, to seek favoritism, and to protect their well-    being. Ironically, while Soviet rule rid society of religious free riders, it    may have produced a population of Communist free riders. And in the    end, free riders will rob any system or group of vitality because they    always attempt to take more than they give.    Subsequent chapters probe the extent to which expressions of pre-    Soviet-era religiosity were mere facades and to which atheist identities    were embraced by social and political opportunists.    Assertion 5    Religion is concerned with the supernatural; everything    else is secondary.    —Rodney Stark and Roger Finke,    Acts of Faith    Because religious communities rely heavily on the active contribution of    members, they are extremely vulnerable to individuals who exploit group    resources. Religious organizations tend to solve this free rider problem by    placing high costs on religious membership.    13    Costs can include tithing    requirements, expectations of time commitment, and behavioral restric-    tions that may increase social stigma and social isolation from the larger    society. These kinds of costs insure that individuals are not simply    exploiting a group for personal gain; their personal sacrifices become evi-    dence of their good faith. Nevertheless, many outside observers of strict    religious groups feel that the costs of religious participation far outweigh    the benefits and question whether the faithful closely consider the costs    32    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 32    Copyrighted    Material    involved in their religion. Why would someone give away their earthly    belongings, deny themselves certain pleasures in life, or risk their lives for    a religious group if they are calculating their self-interest? Religious    believers do these things because they    believe    that they are commanded    by some higher power.    Sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke argue that belief should be    considered an integral part of an individual’s calculations in making any    decision. If one believes she will go to hell if she does not give away her    possessions, then the idea of hell becomes a perceived cost of religious    inaction.    14    Certainly, the eternal pleasures of heaven are worth the tem-    porary pains of worldly deprivation. For this reason, Stark and Finke    indicate that compensations of the afterlife, or    otherworldly rewards,    are    perhaps more important than social rewards in making religious deci-    sions. Belief in otherworldly rewards often explains action that appears    wholly irrational; suicide bombers and religious martyrs are not neces-    sarily depressed or hopeless but are instead idealists who expect to    receive compensation in the afterlife for their earthly sacrifice. Within    this mindset, death does not appear final but is instead a doorway into a    preferable existence. In the final analysis, true religious faith profoundly    influences decision making and can lead to astonishing actions.    Soviet officials certainly understood the power of religious belief to    motivate extraordinary behavior. Yaroslavsky warned Stalin that Soviet    policy should “carefully avoid giving offense to the religious sentiments    of believers, which only leads to the strengthening of religious fanati-    cism.”    15    Even though they would offend religious believers all over the    world, Soviet officials remained conscious of the need to convert indi-    viduals from their religious faith and win the population’s ideological    loyalty.    Consequently, Communist Party leaders created a massive missionary    effort intended to spread the gospel of atheism. The League of Militant    Atheists, a propaganda arm of the Community Party, served as a kind of    a church of Communism in the 1920s and 1930s, with atheist prosely-    tizers and atheist meetinghouses standing in for clerics and churches.    The league distributed atheist newspapers, gave atheist lectures, and    preached the message of scientific atheism to anyone who would listen    (many of whom were compelled to do so). They hoped to transfer peo-    ple’s faith in God to a belief in historical materialism and scientific athe-    ism. Soviet officials felt that atheist conversion was the only way individ-    uals would abandon fanatical behavior aimed at improving one’s    standing in a nonexistent afterlife. In the language of Stark and Finke,    Dreams of Secularization    33    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 33    Copyrighted    Material    atheist propagandists wanted to convince the Soviet population that oth-    erworldly rewards were illusory.    The way to replace religion was clear. Soviet rituals mimicked religious    rites, Soviet theoretical texts were treated like sacred scripture, and Soviet    leaders were hailed as saintlike and deserving of holy reverence. Did    Soviet leaders also attempt to offer individuals a Communist alternative    to otherworldly rewards? Perhaps the promise of Communism was itself    an otherworldly reward. A society devoid of injustice, inequality, or alien-    ation sounds similar to many descriptions of heaven. The doctrine of his-    torical materialism explained that this earthly paradise was inevitable    but could only be achieved with the eradication of all religion. Therefore,    a high cost of the Communist dream was the relinquishing of heavenly    dreams—trading one otherworldly reward for another.    But heavenly dreams offer something that Communism could not:    Religious believers were to experience heaven for themselves, while faith-    ful Communists could only revel in the    thought    that their dreams would    be attained by some future generation. Soviet leaders attempted to    resolve this obvious problem in two ways. First, they promised that the    Communist ideal was within reach and therefore a likely reward in the    near future. This strategy was empirically problematic because Soviet cit-    izens continued to encounter social problems that were, in theory, near-    ing their end. Second, Soviet officials maintained that future generations    would always remember the pioneers in the struggle against oppression;    in this way, the faithful would live forever in the collective memory of    humanity at the “end of history.” In tandem with this effort was a bizarre    reconceptualization of time in which linear conceptions of time were    eschewed in favor of a more “sacred” or “charismatic,” to quote the    political theorist Stephen Hanson, sense of Soviet time.    16    But promises of    remembrance and new conceptions of earthly time fall short of an eternal    life in heaven surrounded by one’s friends and loved ones. Nevertheless,    an attempt was made to convince Soviet citizens that their personal sac-    rifices would not go unrewarded. And in many instances, committed    Communists laid down their lives for the dream of a Soviet utopia.    The importance of otherworldly rewards becomes central to under-    standing the inability of Soviet officials to convert individuals to scientific    atheism. One wonders what might draw individuals to hold atheist    beliefs. The idea that the supernatural is a sham appears to offer no com-    fort or delight. But by tying atheism to historical materialism and scien-    tific progress, Soviet rulers hoped to demonstrate that atheism had its    own benefits. In the end, they argued that atheism was about liberation    34    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 34    Copyrighted    Material    from false belief and salvation from earthly oppression. The attractive-    ness of “this-worldly” salvation reveals much about the primary impor-    tance of the supernatural in religion.    The desire for salvation is difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the Secu-    larization Experiment pitted religious and Communist salvation against    one another, and the following chapters investigate the extent to which    the Soviet population favored one over the other.    Assertion 6    Market forces constrain churches just as they constrain    secular firms.    —Adam Smith,    An Inquiry into the Nature    and Causes of the Wealth of Nations    As a result of their strategies to secularize society, Soviet leaders dramat-    ically altered the composition of religious markets across the Soviet    Union.    Religious market    is a phrase used to describe all the religious    activity going on in any society comprised mainly of one or more orga-    nizations seeking to attract or maintain adherents.    17    The market analogy    is applied to religion because it is expected that religious groups will    compete for members. Few religious groups want members to divide    their time and commitment between multiple groups; therefore, groups    tend to stress exclusive commitment. Because there are a finite number of    people, religious groups must contend for adherents just like sellers of    wares compete for buyers in a market setting. The winners are religious    groups that can attract and sustain members.    Religious markets, like economic markets, are greatly influenced by    how much the state controls them. The Soviet economy was a state-    controlled economy; likewise, Soviet religious culture was state con-    trolled. When the Bolsheviks initially took power, they dramatically    altered the control of existing religious markets. Before the Russian    Revolution, Russians were mostly Orthodox, Lithuanians were mostly    Roman Catholic, and Uzbeks were mostly Muslim. When a population is    overwhelmingly affiliated with one religious tradition, this group has a    religious monopoly:    they have successfully cornered the religious market.    While large numbers of Jews, Old Believers, and Sufis populated the var-    ious regions of the Soviet empire, the Russian Orthodox Church, the    Lithuanian Catholic Church, and Islam all held monopoly control of    their respective republics.    Dreams of Secularization    35    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 35    Copyrighted    Material    Social theorists posit that religious monopolies can only exist when a    religious group is favored by the state. In other words, the government    must actively suppress religious groups that hope to compete with a    favored religion for that religion to maintain its dominance. Studies of    religious deregulation in Europe, Latin America, and the United States    show that reductions in state regulatory policies will lead to the intro-    duction of new religious doctrines and the growth of minority religions.    18    Without religious regulation or in circumstances of complete religious    freedom, a religious market will be more pluralistic because it allows for    the promotion of multiple religious doctrines.    19    Up until the Secularization Experiment, there was no test of what    happens to monopoly religions that encounter antireligious policies. One    prediction is that strong opposition to atheism would appear in regions    with a historically dominant majority religion. Wouldn’t members of a    dominant church rally in large numbers to either secure some religious    freedom or at least successfully withstand religious repression once the    state enacted antireligious policies? This actually seems unlikely when    one considers that religious monopolies require the support of a state to    sustain their dominance. In fact, while the majority of the population    may be affiliated with a monopoly religion, they tend to rarely partici-    pate in religious activities.    20    This means that although monopoly    churches enjoy high membership rates, members tend to have low levels    of commitment. Therefore, uncommitted members of a dominant church    may easily acquiesce to atheistic policies because they are unwilling to    risk personal harm for a religion that they very rarely practice. In other    words, most members of a religious monopoly should turn out to be free    riders.    Nevertheless, individuals may still retain a religious perspective of the    world, even if they are attached halfheartedly to the dominant religious    tradition of their region. Namely, it is one thing to be a “Christmas    Catholic”—someone who only attends church on special occasions—    and quite another to be a convinced atheist. Therefore, Soviet leaders    wanted to do more than just drive individuals away from their religious    traditions; they wanted to drive the population    toward    something. Their    systematic attempts to convert individuals to atheism introduced some-    thing unique into the religious market: an atheist competitor!    Atheism has probably existed as long as there have been religious    worldviews. But never before had atheism been promoted so systemati-    cally and on such a large scale. Practically overnight, formerly accepted,    mainstream religious perspectives became viewed officially as radical and    36    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 36    Copyrighted    Material    antiestablishment. With state support, institutional promotion, the full    force of the media, and atheist proselytizers, the doctrine of scientific    atheism became the new ideological monopoly. While Soviets criticized    the religious monopolies of the past, they actually replicated czarist    attempts to establish devotion and loyalty from the top down.    Soviets understood conversion in terms consistent with the story of    Russia’s Christianization in 988. Legend has it that Prince Vladimir sent    envoys out to investigate the world’s religions. After carefully considering    their reports, Vladimir chose Greek Orthodoxy as the state religion, and    his decree marked the conversion of Russia to Christianity. Nearly one    thousand years later, Soviet leaders would decree atheism the state ideol-    ogy to mark the secularization of society.    In actuality, Christian ideas mixed with indigenous pagan beliefs over    many centuries to result in the Russian Orthodox tradition we know    today. While Vladimir certainly played a key role in altering the religious    landscape of his kingdom by creating a state-supported religion, the    Christianization of Russia was a slow and arduous process that ulti-    mately depended on the success of thousands of Christian messengers    over hundreds of years. Scientific atheists attempted to absorb and alter    many Christian rituals in ways similar to how early Christians infused    pagan practices with Christian messages. Nevertheless, it remained to be    seen if scientific atheism could inspire a popular movement that would    ultimately spread the faith of Communism. Perhaps Soviets would    require a thousand years to secularize the population. But Soviet leaders    had high expectations and, in the end, mistakenly believed that if    Vladimir could Christianize Russia overnight, they could secularize in    similar fashion.    Soviet officials assumed the success of the Secularization Experiment    depended on the elimination of religious monopolies. Ironically, this goal    was celebrated by religious sects throughout the Soviet Union. These    groups had previously suffered intense religious repression under policies    that favored dominant religious monopolies. Therefore, many religious    sects viewed the Soviet assault on the Russian Orthodox Church and    other dominant groups as an overdue comeuppance. In fact, as Soviet    leaders concentrated their antireligious policies on dominant religions,    many of these formerly marginalized religious groups formed new bonds    with the Soviet population. As a result, some small religious groups actu-    ally increased in size under Communism. In the end, the Secularization    Experiment would have a lasting impact on levels of religious pluralism.    Religious pluralism’s effect on religious vitality is a much-debated    Dreams of Secularization    37    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 37    Copyrighted    Material    topic in the social sciences.    21    The market model of religion holds that reli-    gious pluralism increases religiosity because, as in any market, competi-    tion is good for business. The fall of the Soviet Union provides a perfect    test case for this idea. Before Soviet rule, dominant religious groups    enjoyed state favoritism, and during the Soviet era, scientific atheism    became the new ideological monopoly. The collapse of Soviet Com-    munism left a religious market with no clear monopoly.    Which religious groups succeeded and which failed in the post-    Communist world reveals much about the role of religious competition    and the importance of state regulation in the composition and vitality of    religious markets. Using the market analogy, the Secularization Experi-    ment offers something rarely observed—a marginal philosophical tradi-    tion that achieved massive state support almost overnight and subse-    quently lost its political and social advantages just as quickly. The effects    of this bizarre phenomenon greatly inform our understanding of how    changing church-state relationships alters beliefs in a relatively short span    of time.    Making Dreams a Reality    Early Bolsheviks certainly had their work cut out for them. Not only    were their revolutionary dreams big, they had no prior examples of suc-    cessful Communist revolutions from which to model their plans.    Consequently, early revolutionaries relied on theory. Unlike natural sci-    entists, it is rare that a social theorist gets the opportunity to implement    his or her hypotheses to test how they will work in the environment    studied. I expect this is a welcome blessing for most of the population.    But in the Soviet Union’s case, a social experiment was conducted on the    most massive scale imaginable. The religious arm of this experiment was    guided by a series of distinct hypotheses concerning the function, struc-    ture, and purpose of religion and also by some innovative responses to    changing events.    Borrowing from the language of the economics, the multiple theoreti-    cal assertions tested by the Secularization Experiment can be loosely    grouped into    demand-side    and    supply-side hypotheses.    Demand-side    hypotheses of religious growth and decline focus on how the elements of    religion that are attractive to people change over time. For instance, if    one hypothesizes that individuals seek out religious meaning and expla-    nation in times of personal crisis, she would expect that natural disasters    and social upheavals would send large portions of the population run-    38    Dreams of Secularization    UC-Froese.qxp 2/13/2008 12:36 PM Page 38    Copyrighted    Material    ning to seek guidance from religious organizations. In contrast, supply-    side hypotheses of religious growth and decline focus on how the supply    of religious goods changes over time. A popular supply-side assertion is    the controversial religious pluralism hypothesis developed by Stark and    Finke that states, “To the degree that religious economies are unregulated    and competitive, overall levels of religious commitment will be high.”    22    This hypothesis indicates that religiosity changes to the extent that    churches are allowed to and attempt to actively recruit new members. In    simple terms, demand-side explanations analyze why individuals seek    out religion, and supply-side explanations study how churches seek out    members.    Contemporary theorists of religion tend to pit these two explanatory    perspectives against one another. But Soviet officials experimented with    both supply-side and demand-side models of religious change. At first,    the Soviet regime assumed that religiosity was wholly a product of reli-    gious supply. Their altering of church-state relationships and attempts to    shut down religious institutions represent tactics to cut off religious sup-    ply. The successes and failures of this supply-side strategy are investigated    in chapter 4, “Shutting Off Religious Supply.”    But Soviet theorists also hypothesized that the demand for religion    was the product of economic woes, simple ignorance, and an innate need    for ritual expression. The campaign to modernize and reeducate the    Soviet population and provide them with atheist rituals was a demand-    side strategy to redirect what theorists posited were the sources of reli-    gious need. The successes and failures of this strategy are investigated in    chapter 5, “Hunting for Religious Demand.”    Finally, chapter 7 revisits the six assertions presented above to clarify    how findings from the Soviet Secularization Experiment support or    undermine these basic theoretical perspectives. Ultimately, the secular-    ization dreams of the early Bolsheviks never became a reality, but their    attempts to make their dreams real drastically altered the religious lives    of Soviet citizens and have a lasting influence across the post-Soviet    regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. And their application of so-    cial theories of religion still have much to teach theorists and researchers    today.

Clarke shows us how Taoist texts, ideas, and practices have been assimilated within a whole range of Western ideas and agendas. We see how Chinese thinkers such as Lao-tzu and Chuang tzu, along with practices such as Feng Shui and Tai Chi, have been used as a key Western inspiration in religion, philosophy, ethics, politics, ecology and health.The Tao of the West not only provides a fascinating introduction to Taoism, it also offers a timely insight into the history of the West's encounter with this ancient tradition, and into the issues arising from inter-cultural dialogue. Anyone interested in understanding the key influence Taoism has had on the West will welcome and embrace this book.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

On 31 January 2002, the Boston Globe published a report that sent shockwaves around the world. Their findings, based on a six-month campaign by the 'Spotlight' investigative team, showed that hundreds of children in Boston had been abused by Catholic priests, and that this horrific pattern of behaviour had been known - and ignored - by the Catholic Church. Instead of protecting the community it was meant to serve, the Church exploited its powerful influence to protect itself from scandal - and innocent children paid the price. This is the story from beginning to end: the predatory men who exploited the vulnerable, the cabal of senior Church officials who covered up their crimes, the 'hush money' used to buy the victims' silence, the survivors who found the strength to tell their story, and the Catholics across the world who were left shocked, angry, and betrayed. This is the story, too, of how they took power back, confronted their Church and called for sweeping change. Updated for the release of the Oscar-nominated film Spotlight, this is a devastating and important exposure of the abuse of power at the highest levels in society.

And that is most certainly the case with the narrations produced in academia.  An anthropologist in Bahia, Brazil, fears to become possessed by the spirits he had come to study; falls madly in love with an 'informant'; finds himself baffled by the sayings of a clairvoyant; and has to come to grips with the murder of one of his best friends.  Unsettling events that do not belong to the orderly world of scientific research, yet leave their imprint on the way the anthropologist comes to understand the world.  REflecting on his long research experience with the spirit possession cult Candomblé, the author shows, in a probing manner, how definitions of reality always require the exclusion of certain perceptions, experiences and insights.  And yet, this 'rest-of-what-is' turns out to be an inexhaustible source of amazement, seduction and renewal."" --P [4] of cover.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Il y a 90% de musulmans, 5% de chrétiens et 5% d'adeptes de l'animisme. C'est le pays où le premier président de la République, Léopold Sédar Senghor, était catholique, où les concessions comptent à la fois des ménages musulmans et chrétiens, où les musulmans et les catholiques partagent le même cimetière (Joal-Fadhiout et Ziguinchor), où les conjoints partagent des religions différentes, où les écoles privées catholiques comptent 60 à 70% d'élèves de confession musulmane, etc. Ce phénomène n'est pas dû au hasard. En fait, l'histoire et la sociologie des religions permettent de l'expliquer amplement. Nous nous sommes permis de mettre en exergue cette exception sénégalaise en recourant à ces deux disciplines qui se complètent pour la connaissance des sociétés. Au moment où notre monde actuel est en proie au fanatisme, à l'intolérance et au terrorisme religieux, le Sénégal, lui, propose un autre ""modèle"".""--Page 4 of cover.

Until now, the discipline of religious studies lacked a consistent and coherent text that highlights the developing work at the intersections of hip hop, religion and theology. Moving beyond an institutional understanding of religion and offering a multidimensional assortment of essays, this new volume charts new ground by bringing together voices who, to this point, have been a disparate and scattered few. Comprehensively organized with the foundational and most influential works that continue to provide a base for current scholarship, The Hip Hop and Religion Reader frames the lively and expanding conversation on hip hop's influence on the academic study of religion.

Todd Johnson, a noted expert on global Christianity and world missions trends, and Cindy Wu show how divisions within these families work against our desire to bring about positive change in the world. They provide an overview of global Christian identity, exploring how we can be faithful to our own tradition while engaging Christians across denominations and be better informed as we work with people of other religions.

Religious believers who want to live their lives in accordance with 'the law of God' are often considered a threat to civilization. To many, monotheistic religion is inherently repressive and violent. The central aim of this volume is to think of both God and civilization in a more open, space-giving way. God is seen as the One who prevents us from making an absolute claim for a relative reality, including our own religion and culture. The multifaceted relations between God and civilization are explored from systematic-theological, missiological, philosophical and ethical perspectives.

Americans came to associate atheism with radical social philosophies that advocated violence--especially anarchism and communism. Avowed nonbelievers were derided, even the famous patriot Thomas Paine. Only in the twentieth century, with the passage of laws allowing for conscientious objection to war, did nonbelief enter debates about religious liberty. Still, today every one of the fifty states has God written into its constitution, with eight requiring a belief in God for holding public office. God is everywhere in American public life: on our currency, in the Pledge of Allegiance, and in the national motto. R. Laurence Moore and Isaac Kramnick explore both God's omnipresence and the dramatic rise in nonbelievers that has led to an 'atheist awakening' intent on holding the country to its secular principles""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

It is thus concerned with official religion and with exploring the interface between human and divine in the major temples of the ancient Near East. Hundley identifies common ancient Near Eastern temple systems and, more particularly, examines such issues as what a temple structure communicates, how it was understood to function, and its ideology; how the divine presence is installed in a temple, often in the form of a cult image; the relationship between deity and image(s); how a deity's presence in the temple, particularly in the cults statue, is related to his or her divine essence and presence elsewhere; and how humanity serves the deity in order to ensure continued presence. This volume collects and synthesizes a vast amount of data, draws on the insights of multiple related disciplines (e.g., architectural and spatial theory, ritual theory, theories of language, art history, archaeology, sociocultural anthropology, and comparative studies) and offers a single interpretive lens through which to view it.""--Back cover.

The research was performed as an interdisciplinary study involving the evidence of the Homeric poems, archaeology, linguistics, as well as comparative Indo-European material. It is argued that Greek Zeus, as a god with certainly established Indo-European origins, was essentially a god of the open sky and the supposed progenitor of everything, a supreme, but not ruling deity; initially, he must have been distinct from the god of storms, who, for unknown reasons, completely disappeared from Greek religion and mythology by as early as the Late Bronze Age. From the time of Homer, Zeus-Father appeared as a storm-god, the autocratic ruler of the universe, and an offspring of elder deities, on the level of mythology. Such a concept does not correspond to the traditional Indo-European patterns and seems to have been formed under the influence of Near-Eastern concepts of the supreme almighty god, on the one hand, and the Cretan-Minoan concept of a young god/divine child, on the other. However, the Homeric concept of Zeus was adopted by his practising cults much later, only from the Late Archaic period.""--Publisher's web site.

A nine-thousand-year old town in central Turkey, Çatalhöyük was first excavated in the 1960s and has since become integral to understanding the symbolic and ritual worlds of the early farmers and village-dwellers in the Middle East. It is thus an ideal location for exploring theories about the role of religion in early settled life. This book provides a unique overview of current debates concerning religion and its historical variations. Through exploration of themes including the integration of the spiritual and the material, the role of belief in religion, the cognitive bases for religion, and religion's social roles, this book situates the results from Çatalhöyük within a broader understanding of the Neolithic in the Middle East""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The sacred in the modern world,Gordon Lynch,religion,First published in 2012,/works/OL16636735W,/authors/OL5523172A/Gordon_Lynch,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2012|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English|Pages 181,"""It is often claimed that we live in a secular age. But we do not live in a desacralized one. Sacred forms - whether in 'religious' or 'secular' guise - continue to shape social life in the modern world, giving rise to powerful emotions, polarized group identities, and even the very concept of moral society. Analyzing contemporary sacred forms is essential if we are to be able to make sense of the societies we live in and think critically about the effects of the sacred on our lives for good or ill.  The Sacred in the Modern World is a major contribution to this task. Re-interpreting Durkheim's theory of the sacred, and drawing on the 'strong program' in cultural sociology, Gordon Lynch sets out a theory of the sacred that can be used by researchers across a range of humanities and social science disciplines. Using vividly drawn contemporary case material - including the abuse and neglect of children in Irish residential schools and the controversy over the BBC's decision not to air an appeal for aid for Gaza - the book demonstrates the value of this theoretical approach for social and cultural analysis. The key role of public media for the circulation and contestation of the sacred comes under close scrutiny. Adopting a critical stance towards sacred forms, Lynch reflects upon the ways in which sacred commitments can both serve as a moral resource for social life and legitimate horrifying acts of collective evil. He concludes by reflecting on how we might live thoughtfully and responsibility under the light and shadow that the sacred casts, asking whether society without the sacred is possible or desirable.""--Publisher's website.

The Myth of Persecution,Candida R.

According to cherished church tradition and popular belief, before the Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal in the fourth century, early Christians were systematically persecuted by a brutal Roman Empire intent on their destruction. As the story goes, vast numbers of believers were thrown to the lions, tortured, or burned alive because they refused to renounce Christ. These saints, Christianity's inspirational heroes, are still venerated today. Moss, however, exposes that the ""Age of Martyrs"" is a fiction. There was no sustained 300-year-long effort by the Romans to persecute Christians. Instead, these stories were pious exaggerations; highly stylized rewritings of Jewish, Greek, and Roman noble death traditions; and even forgeries designed to marginalize heretics, inspire the faithful, and fund churches. The traditional story of persecution is still taught in Sunday school classes, celebrated in sermons, and employed by church leaders, politicians, and media pundits who insist that Christians were -- and always will be -- persecuted by a hostile, secular world. While violence against Christians does occur in select parts of the world today, the rhetoric of persecution is both misleading and rooted in an inaccurate history of the early church. Moss urges modern Christians to abandon the conspiratorial assumption that the world is out to get Christians and, rather, embrace the consolation, moral instruction, and spiritual guidance that these martyrdom stories provide. - Publisher.

Now, in Religion in the Oval Office, Smith takes on eleven more of our nation's most interesting and influential chief executives: John Adams, James Madison, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, William McKinley, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama. Drawing on a wide range of sources and paying close attention to historical context and America's shifting social and moral values, he examines their religious beliefs, commitments, affiliations, and practices and scrutinizes their relationships with religious leaders and communities. The result is a fascinating account of the ways in which religion has helped shape the course of our history. From John Quincy Adams' treatment of Native Americans, to Harry Truman's decision to recognize Israel, to Bill Clinton's promotion of religious liberty and welfare reform, to Barack Obama's policies on poverty and gay rights, Smith shows how strongly our presidents' religious commitments have affected policy from the earliest days of our nation to the present. Together with Faith and the Presidency, Religion in the Oval Office provides the most comprehensive examination of the inseparable and intriguing relationship between faith and the American presidency. This book will be invaluable to anyone interested in the presidency and the role of religion in politics. - Publisher.   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Zachman places Calvin in conversation with theologians such as Pascal, Kierkegaard, Ezra the Scribe, Julian of Norwich and Karl Barth, and attends to themes in Calvin's theology which are often overlooked. Zachman draws out Calvin's use of astronomy and great concern to see ourselves in comparison to the immensity of the universe, acknowledging in wonder and awe our nothingness before God. Throughout, Zachman presents a Calvin who seeks a route out of self-deception to self-knowledge, though Kierkegaard shows that it is love, and not judgment, that most deeply reveals us to ourselves. The book discusses Calvin's understanding of the election of the Jews and their relationship to God, and further reconsiders Calvin's understanding of judgment and how the call to love our neighbour is undermined by the formation of alliances""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Dr. Cynthia Landrum explore her passion for her liberal religious tradition. The heart of Unitarian Universalist faith, as explored here, has to do with its all-inclusive love, its spiritual freedom, and its commitment to a just world. Ranging from sermons about contemporary justice issues to classic works of literature, all of these writings connect to a deeper faith that calls us to the work of love and justice. Her core message is of a Universalist all-inclusive belief in the inherent worth and dignity of all people, of a spirituality of connectedness and relationship, and of hands-on engagement with the world.

Faith and the Founders of the American Republic,Daniel L. Dreisbach,religion,First published in 2014,/works/OL16816771W,/authors/OL1197380A/Daniel_L._Dreisbach,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL25443197M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2014|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Language English,"The role of religion in the founding of America has long been a hotly debated question. Some historians have regarded the views of a few famous founders, such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Thomas Paine, as evidence that the founders were deists who advocated the strict separation of church and state. Popular Christian polemicists, on the other hand, have attempted to show that virtually all of the founders were pious Christians in favor of public support for religion. As the essays in this volume demonstrate, a diverse array of religious traditions informed the political culture of the American founding. Faith and the Founders of the American Republic includes studies both of minority faiths, such as Islam and Judaism, and of major traditions like Calvinism. It also includes nuanced analysis of specific founders -- Quaker fellow-traveler John Dickinson, prominent Baptists Isaac Backus and John Leland, and theistic rationalist Gouverneur Morris, among others -- with attention to their personal histories, faiths, constitutional philosophies, and views on the relationship between religion and the state.

Using hitherto unknown materials, Jill Watts portrays the life and career of one of the twentieth century's most intriguing religious leaders, Father Divine. Starting as an itinerant preacher, Father Divine built an unprecedented movement that by the 1930s had attracted followers across the nation and around the world. As his ministry grew, so did the controversy surrounding his enormous wealth, flamboyant style, and committed ""angels""—black and white, rich and poor alike.  Here for the first time a full account of Father Divine's childhood and early years challenges previous contentions that he was born into a sharecropping family in the deep South. While earlier biographers have concentrated on Father Divine's social and economic programs, Watts focuses on his theology, which gives new meaning to secular activities that often appeared contradictory. Although much has been written about Father Divine, God, Harlem U.S.A. finally provides a balanced and intimate account of his life's work.

Your family’s lives?  To many Christians in the Middle East today, a “momentary, light affliction” means enduring only torture instead of martyrdom. The depth of oppression Jesus followers suffer is unimaginable to most Western Christians. Yet, it is an everyday reality for those who choose faith over survival in Syria, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, and other countries hostile to the Gospel of Christ. In Killing Christians, Tom Doyle takes readers to the secret meetings, the torture rooms, the grim prisons, and even the executions that are the “calling” of countless Muslims-turned-Christians.  Each survivor longs to share with brothers and sisters “on the outside” what Christ has taught them. Killing Christians is their message to readers who still enjoy freedom to practice their faith. None would wish their pain and suffering on those who do not have to brave such misery, but the richness gained through their remarkable trials are delivered—often in their own words—through this book. The stories are breathtaking, the lessons soul-stirring and renewing. Killing Christians presents the dead serious work of expanding and maintaining the Faith.  “When you’re looking for real-life accounts of 21st Century believers whose lives are literally at stake for their beliefs, it demands the credibility of a man who has the smell of the front lines of the battlefield on his clothes because he was there yesterday and will be back there tomorrow. I’m proud to say my friend Tom Doyle is that man.”  —Jerry B. Jenkins, Novelist & Biographer   Read more Read less",2 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

When thirty-eight-year-old Ian Thorson died from dehydration and dysentery on a remote Arizona mountaintop in 2012, The New York Times reported the story under the headline: ""Mysterious Buddhist Retreat in the Desert Ends in a Grisly Death."" Scott Carney, a journalist and anthropologist who lived in India for six years, was struck by how Thorson's death echoed other incidents that reflected the little-talked-about connection between intensive meditation and mental instability. Using these tragedies as a springboard, Carney explores how those who go to extremes to achieve divine revelations-and undertake it in illusory ways-can tangle with madness. He also delves into the unorthodox interpretation of Tibetan Buddhism that attracted Thorson and the bizarre teachings of its chief evangelists: Thorson's wife, Lama Christie McNally, and her previous husband, Geshe Michael Roach, the supreme spiritual leader of Diamond Mountain University, where Thorson died. Carney unravels how the cultlike practices of McNally and Roach and the questionable circumstances surrounding Thorson's death illuminate a uniquely American tendency to mix and match eastern religious traditions like LEGO pieces in a quest to reach an enlightened, perfected state, no matter the cost. Aided by Thorson's private papers, along with cutting-edge neurological research that reveals the profound impact of intensive meditation on the brain and stories of miracles and black magic, sexualized rituals, and tantric rites from former Diamond Mountain acolytes, A Death on Diamond Mountain is a gripping work of investigative journalism that reveals how the path to enlightenment can be riddled with danger""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|1 Have read

They ask, for example, to what degree science and religion, as well as other fields of learning, may find common ground. They examine the pitfalls, as well as the opportunities, posed by genetic engineering. They examine the need for science to develop a proper ethical dimension, particularly in relation to weapons of war, if it is to realize its true potential. Exhibiting everywhere a sensitive humanity, as well as a deep respect for their different backgrounds, the participants exemplify in these civilized exchanges a mutual passion for developing dialogue as a profound and practical way of cultivating both toleration and peace.""--Provided by publisher   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

We offer an alternative analysis that helps explain the persistent demand for religion, the different types of religious that naturally arise, and the special attributes of the ""sectarian"" type.  Sects are adept at producing club goods both spiritual and material.  Where governments and economies function poorly, sects often become major suppliers of social services, political action, and coercive force.  Their success as providers is much more due to the advantages of their organizational structure than it is to their theology.  Religious militancy is most effectively controlled through a combination of policies that raise the direct costs of violence, foster religious competition, improve social services, and encourage private enterprise""--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.

Examines how many core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science. Explores the scientific discoveries of the rishis, ancient Vedic sages, and how they have only recently been rediscovered by Western scientists. Reveals the concepts of quantum physics hidden within the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas. Called ""the scientists of Hinduism,"" the rishis of ancient India were the scribes of the Vedas. They developed the spiritual science of Hinduism, Sanatana Dharma, as their way of ensuring the constant renewal and progress of India's spiritual tradition and culture. Sanatana Dharma permeates every aspect of Hindu culture, from religion to the arts to the sciences. Woven within its Vedic texts lie all of the essential concepts of quantum physics and other modern scientific discoveries. Providing a complete introduction to the science of Sanatana Dharma, Vanamali reveals how the core concepts of Hinduism, including Brahman, Atman, bhakti, karma, and reincarnation, relate to modern science and how the scientific discoveries of the ancient rishis have been recently rediscovered by the West. She examines the scientific principles within the classic stories and texts of India, including the Vedas, the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Puranas. Within the teachings of the ancient Puranic sages and saints such as Valmiki and Vyasa and legendary physicians and mathematician-philosophers such as Aryabhatta and Varahamihir, the author reveals great scientific truths--not those believed by the ancient world, but truths still upheld by modern science, particularly quantum physics. She explores Desha and Kaala (Space and Time), Shankara and his philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, and the Hindu sciences of mathematics, astronomy, and Vedic astrology. In illustrating the scientific basis of Hinduism and the discoveries of its sages, Vanamali provides a window into the depths of this most ancient spiritual way of life""--   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

Ancient Divination and Experience,Lindsay Driediger-Murphy,religion,First published in 2019,/works/OL23498479W,/authors/OL8908218A/Lindsay_Driediger-Murphy,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2019|Publisher  Oxford University Press|Pages 320,"The introduction to this volume describes the contribution that it makes to scholarship on ancient divinatory practices. It analyses previous and current research, arguing that while this predominantly functionalist work reveals important socio-political dimensions of divination, it also runs the risk of obscuring from view the very people, ideologies, and experiences that scholars seek to understand. It explains that the essays in this volume focus on re-examining what ancient people—primarily those in ancient Greek and Roman communities, but also Mesopotamian and Chinese cultures—thought they were doing through divination. The Introduction provides an overview of the content of each chapter and identifies key themes and questions shared across chapters. The volume explores the types of relationships that divination created between mortals and gods, and what this can tell us about the religions and cultures in which divination was practised.

The book examines salient themes of social and religious significance such as gender, sexuality, race, social class, health care, and public policy. While the volume centers around African American experiences and studies, it also attends to broader African continental and Diasporan religious contexts. The contributors reflect an interdisciplinary blend of Black Church Studies scholars and practitioners from across the country. The text seeks to address the following fundamental questions: What constitutes Black Church Studies as a discipline or field of study? What is the significance of Black Church Studies for theological education? What is the relationship between Black Church Studies and the broader academic study of Black religions? What is the relationship between Black Church Studies and local congregations (as well as other faith-based entities)? The book's search for the answers to these questions is compelling and illuminating. (Publisher).   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

D.G. Hart explores specifically the social and political developments that enabled Calvinism to establish a global presence. Hart's approach features significant episodes in the institutional history of Calvinism that are responsible for its contemporary profile. He traces the political and religious circumstances that first created space for Reformed churches in Europe and later contributed to Calvinism's expansion around the world. He discusses the effects of the American and French Revolutions on ecclesiastical establishments as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century communions, particularly in Scotland, the Netherlands, the United States, and Germany, that directly challenged church dependence on the state. Raising important questions about secularization, religious freedom, privatization of faith, and the place of religion in public life, this book will appeal not only to readers with interests in the history of religion but also in the role of religion in political and social life today"" - Provided by publisher.

This book examines the ways religion can both compel and constrain involvement in politics and policy. What facilitates political participation? What impedes it? What are the limits of religious mobilization and involvement? Are there benefits? Are there dangers? Religion and Politics in the United States addresses these questions by exploring how religion has influenced the structure of American government and law as well as how religious perspectives inform contemporary political issues including topics such as equal rights for women and gays. The book also explores the ways that religion has affected the orientation of partisan politics in the United States. Through a detailed review of the political attitudes and behaviors of major religious and minority faith traditions, the book establishes that religion continues to be a major part of the American cultural and political milieu while explaining that it must interact with many other factors to impact political outcomes in the United States. The sixth edition reviews the role of religion in the 2008 election, and includes fully up-to-date coverage of how religion informs the civil rights struggles of women and gay Americans. - Publisher.

Refrigerator doors. Scrapbooks and sock drawers and top shelves. These are the places we store our treasures--the keepsakes that tell the story of whom and what we've loved, how we've lived, and what matters most to us. God is a collector, too, whose treasures are tucked securely into the pages of his book: a golden bell here, an olive leaf there, a scarlet thread, a blood-stained cloth, a few grains of barley. Each of these saved artifacts reveals a facet of his heart and tells the story of a Father whose most precious possession is...us. In Treasured, Leigh McLeroy considers tangible reminders of God's active presence and guides us in discovering evidence in our own lives of his attentive love.From the Hardcover edition.

Diese Veränderung ist nicht leicht. Grof hat auf Grund jahrelanger Forschungen eine Methode entwickelt, durch die der Klient mit der Unterstützung des Therapeuten die traumatischen Erfahrungen wiedererleben und in sein bewußtsein integrieren kann. Diese Therapie hat sich zur Heilung von tiefen seelischen Krisen bewährt und sich als hervorragender Weg zur Selbsterkenntnis erwiesen. In diesem Buch erklärt Grof die Grundlagen seiner Therapie, beschreibt, was in einer Sitzung passieren kann, und liefert Berichte von Leute4n, die dabei außergewöhnliche Erfahrungen gemacht haben.  Über den Autor: Stanislav Grof, Dr. med., Dr. phil., ist Psychiater mit mehr als 50-jähriger Erfahrung auf dem Forschungsgebiet für außergewöhnliche Bewusstseinszustände und gilt weltweit als der maßgebliche Experte für Transpersonale Psychologie; innerhalb derer prägte er u.a. den Begriff „Holotropes Atmen“ – für eine Atemarbeit, die heute in vielen therapeutischen Kreisen Eingang gefunden hat und in der er nach wie vor auch ausbildet. Grof ist Gründer und Präsident der International Transpersonal Association (ITA), Professor für Psychologie am California Institute of Integral Studies sowie am Pacifica Graduate Institute; Autor zahlreicher, populärwissenschaftlicher Bücher, die in 16 Sprachen übersetzt wurden; darunter Klassiker wie Geburt, Tod und Transzendenz / Spirituelle Krisen / Das Abenteuer der Selbstentdeckung / Kosmos und Psyche.    Stanislav Grof, der Pionier für Bewusstseinsliteratur, wurde über die Jahre häufig geehrt: aktuelles Ereignis ist der „Award Vision“ im Oktober 2007 in Prag – verliehen von Vaclav Havel.    Grof hält weltweit Vorträge, Seminare und ist regelmäßig pro Jahr auch in Europa zu Gast – spricht ausgezeichnet Deutsch! Er lebt in Mill Valley/Kalifornien.

Like the death of a loved one, divorce plunges us into grief and loneliness, heartache and depression. Perhaps worst of all, divorce makes us believe that all that is meaningful and joyful has come to an end. Do not believe it. Better Days Are Just Ahead.You already know that divorce is one of the greatest challenges you will ever face. Yet it also can trigger tremendous growth in several key areas, including your relationships, the way you see yourself, and how you live out your faith. No one is calling divorce a blessing. But it is something that you will live through and that can help to powerfully transform you into the person God has created you to be. Whether you are in the earliest stages of divorce, are newly single again, are processing an earlier divorce, or know someone whose marriage is ending, New Life After Divorce offers encouragement and hope that this new life will be a good life--and the promise that healing, strength, purpose, and joy are around the corner.From the Trade Paperback edition.

"Early Christian Attitudes to War, Violence and Military Service",Despina Iosif,religion,First published in 2013,/works/OL28054129W,/authors/OL10463948A/Despina_Iosif,/images/icons/avatar_book-sm.png,Publish Date 2013|Publisher  Gorgias Press|Language English|Pages 392,"The traditional view is that early Christians, prior to emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity, were pacifists who stubbornly refused to enlist in the Roman army and engage in warfare, preferring to die rather than betray their beliefs. However, a plethora of literary and archaeological evidence demonstrates that was not usually the case. The majority of early Christians did not find military service or warfare particularly problematic. Christians integrated with the dominant mores of society and that included military service. It is, in fact, possible that Christianity was particularly attractive to those in military service. This study looks to reposition early Christian ethics and the attitude towards war and to bring new understanding to the relationship between military service and Christianity.

Render unto Caesar,Charles J.

They will often disagree about doctrine or policy, but they won't be quiet. They can't be. They'll act on what they believe, sometimes at the cost of their reputations and careers. Obviously the common good demands a respect for other people with different beliefs and a willingness to compromise whenever possible. But for Catholics, the common good can never mean muting themselves in public debate on foundational issues of human dignity. Christian faith is always personal but never private. This is why any notion of tolerance that tries to reduce faith to private idiosyncrasy, or a set of opinions that we can indulge at home but need to be quiet about in public, will always fail.""--From the IntroductionFew topics in recent years have ignited as much public debate as the balance between religion and politics. Does religious thought have any place in political discourse? Do religious believers have the right to turn their values into political action? What does it truly mean to have a separation of church and state? The very heart of these important questions is here addressed by one of the leading voices on the topic, Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of Denver. While American society has ample room for believers and nonbelievers alike, Chaput argues, our public life must be considered within the context of its Christian roots. American democracy does not ask its citizens to put aside their deeply held moral and religious beliefs for the sake of public policy. In fact, it requires exactly the opposite. As the nation's founders knew very well, people are fallible. The majority of voters, as history has shown again and again, can be uninformed, misinformed, biased, or simply wrong. Thus, to survive, American democracy depends on an engaged citizenry --people of character, including religious believers, fighting for their beliefs in the public square--respectfully but vigorously, and without apology. Anything less is bad citizenship and a form of theft from the nation's health. Or as the author suggests: Good manners are not an excuse for political cowardice.American Catholics and other persons of goodwill are part of a struggle for our nation's future, says Charles J. Chaput. Our choices, including our political choices, matter. Catholics need to take an active, vocal, and morally consistent role in public debate. We can't claim to personally believe in the sanctity of the human person, and then act in our public policies as if we don't. We can't separate our private convictions from our public actions without diminishing both. In the words of the author, ""How we act works backward on our convictions, making them stronger or smothering them under a snowfall of alibis.""Vivid, provocative, clear, and compelling, Render unto Caesar is a call to American Catholics to serve the highest ideals of their nation by first living their Catholic faith deeply, authentically.

In an effort to consolidate their power on the Iberian peninsula and free themselves from the yoke of the Vatican, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella turned to the priest Tomas de Torquemada, a member of the Dominican order. Torquemada urged an Inquisition that would strengthen the sovereigns' authority throughout Spain, particularly in the coming campaign against the Moors of Granada. When Granada fell, tens of thousands of Muslims were given the choice of converting to Christianity or facing death or banishment. Torquemada then turned his ferocity on Spain's Jews, forcing upon them the same grim choice. And in the end, more than 120,000 Jews left their homeland. With rich characterizations of the central players and breathtaking descriptions of the starkly beautiful Iberian peninsula, Dogs of God also portrays a time during which the entanglement of religious and political passions set the stage for the birth of modern Europe.  Ferdinand and Isabella, in solidifying their control over the Iberian peninsula, also presaged the creation of the modern state, with its centralized authority and its collective sense of identity.Reston's engrossing narrative brings all of the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition into a terrifyingly brutal focus. And he looks beyond the dark deeds of 1492 as well, capturing the excitement of exploration and the promise of the future that was born in the same year. With an iron grip secured on the political affairs of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella turned their eyes toward the New World and the creation of an empire--and toward a young sea captain named Christopher Columbus.

The first is a translation of selections from the Diamond Sutra itself, an ancient text comprised of conversations between the Buddha and his close disciple Subhuti. Considered a central work by Buddhists throughout the world, the Diamond Sutra has been the focus of much interpretation over the centuries. In the second layer, Geshe Michael quotes from some of the best commentaries of the Tibetan tradition. In the main text, the third layer, he uses both sutra and commentary as a jumping-off point for presenting his own teaching.Geshe Michael gives fresh insight into ancient wisdom by using examples from his own experience as one of the founders of the Andin International Diamond Corporation, which was started with capital of fifty thousand dollars and which today has annual sales in excess of one hundred million dollars. Much of the success of Andin has come from applying the business strategies presented in The Diamond Cutter. Geshe Michael's easy style and spiritual understanding make this work of timeless wisdom an invaluable source for those already familiar with, and those unfamiliar with, Tibetan Buddhism.From the Hardcover edition.

The illuminated prayer,Coleman Barks,religion,First published in 2000,/works/OL3627251W?edition=ia%3Ailluminatedpraye00bark,/authors/OL618326A/Coleman_Barks,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16967431M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2000|Publisher  Ballantine Wellspring|Language English|Pages 144,"The Prayer is a drawing of the curtain, an invitation to a secret place that is discovered and explored. . . .According to tradition and the testimony of Sufi mystics, The Prayer--or Salat--was first taught by the angels, who themselves practiced it in celestial adoration. The Prayer is God's gift to all humankind, and in this gorgeously illustrated volume, its simple, archetypal practice unfolds like a fragrant, many-petaled flower, joining words and movements into a single luminous event that engages our entire being.These ancient rituals are presented here as a gift for anyone with a heartfelt desire to set aside for a moment the concerns of every day and enter a sacred time and space in which to explore the beckonings of the spirit. The authors take us through the words, movements, and hidden meanings of the Call to Prayer, the Ablutions, The Prayer itself, and the Peaceful Embrace afterwards. Faithful practice lends a sacred rhythm to each day and creates a psychological force that helps us nurture and express a profound inner harmony.This first, marvelously accessible interpretation of The Prayer also offers a compelling introductin to the wisdom and teachings of the beloved contemporary Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, who brought new life to this mystical tradition by opening a passage to its deepest, universal realities. It is the loving handiwork of two of Bawa's best-known students, Coleman Barks and Michael Green, who also created The Illuminated Rumi.Like a jewel given extra brilliance by its setting, The Prayer is surrounded by the wisdom and understanding of the thirteenth-century Sufi master Rumi, whose generous poetry has become an essential canon for modern-day seekers in the West. The final gift is the Primeval Kalima, the core practice and most profound teaching of the Sufi, the ""open secret"" that leads to Divine Luminous Wisdom.From the Hardcover edition.

It provides a wide array of materials on both heresy (Cathars and Waldensians) and the persecution of heresy in medieval France. The book is divided into eight sections, each devoted to a different genre of source material. It contains substantial material pertaining to the setting up and practice of inquisitions into heretical wickedness, and a large number of translations from the registers of inquisition trials.

Born to Boston Puritans, by his teenage years Franklin had abandoned the exclusive Christian faith of his family and embraced deism. But Franklin, as a man of faith, was far more complex than the ""thorough"" deist who emerges in his autobiography. As Thomas Kidd reveals, deist writers influenced Franklin's beliefs, to be sure, but devout Christians in his life--including George Whitefield, the era's greatest evangelical preacher; his parents; and his beloved sister Jane--kept him tethered to the Calvinist creed of his Puritan upbringing. Based on rigorous research into Franklin's voluminous correspondence, essays, and almanacs, this fresh assessment of a well-known figure unpacks the contradictions and conundrums faith presented in Franklin's life."" -- Publisher's description   Read more Read less",0 Want to read|0 Currently reading|0 Have read

The Grand Inquisitors Manual: a history of terror in the name of  God,Jonathan Kirsch,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL1907978W?edition=ia%3Agrandinquisi_kirs_2008_000_8670472,/authors/OL228450A/Jonathan_Kirsch,//covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL16698508M-M.jpg,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  HarperOne|Language English,"""The inquisitorial apparatus that was first invented in the Middle Ages remained in operation for the next six-hundred years, and it has never been wholly dismantled. As we shall see, an unbroken thread links the friar-inquisitors who set up the rack and the pyre in southern France in the early thirteenth century to the torturers and executioners of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia in the mid-twentieth century. Nor does the thread stop at Auschwitz or the Gulag; it can be traced through the Salem witch trials in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the Hollywood blacklists of the McCarthy era, and even the interrogation cells at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.""The twelfth century birthed a new and sinister brand of sanctioned terror, an international network of secret police and courts, an army of inquisitors whose sworn duty was to seek out anyone regarded as an enemy, and a casualty list numbering in the tens of thousands. The original agents of the Inquisition—priests and monks, scribes and notaries, attorneys and accountants, torturers and executioners—were deputized by the Church and their worst excesses were excused as the pardonable sins of soldiers engaged in a holy war against heresy that became the obsession of Christendom. Yet the first rumblings of Western civilization's great engine of persecution provided no indication of the ultimate scope and influence of the inquisitorial toolkit and how the crimes of the first inquisitors were perpetrated again and again into the twentieth century and beyond. Despite the importance of this legacy, the history of the Inquisition remains a subject that has largely been overlooked by general historians.With The Grand Inquisitor's Manual, national bestselling author Jonathan Kirsch delivers a sweeping and provocative history that explores how the Inquisition was honed to perfection and brought to bear on an ever-widening circle of victims by authoritarians in both church and state for over six hundred years. Ranging from the Knights Templar to the first Protestants, from Joan of Arc to Galileo; from the torture and murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent women during the Witch Craze to its greatest power in Spain after 1492, when the secret tribunals and torture chambers were directed for the first time against Jews and Muslims to the modern war on terror—Kirsch shows us how the Inquisition stands as a universal and ineradicable symbol of the terror that results when absolute power works its corruptions.The history of the Inquisition is draped in myth and mystery, a favorite theme of both artists and propagandists throughout the six hundred years of its active operations. Yet when we pull aside the veil, what we see are the original blueprints for the machinery of persecution that was invented in the High Middle Ages and applied to human flesh ever since. The Grand Inquisitor's Manual exposes the dangerous circular logic of the Inquisition so that we do not perpetuate its brand of terror.

Americans are accustomed to seeing their country center stage as a world power, but as Hitchcock carefully details, this may not be the case in the final scene. Based on extensive research of the Bible and other sources, The Late Great United States provides compelling and often surprising answers to questions like these:-Does the Bible say anything about America in the last days?-How could the U.S. fit into God's prophetic plan? -Will America survive?-Might the anti-Christ come from America?-Could America's addiction to oil be her undoing?-Will America be destroyed by a nuclear attack?-Could America fall from within as a result of moral corruption? -Is America still a ""blessed"" nation?-How should individual Christians respond to a world in chaos?Regardless of America's final fate and the outcome of dire events at the end of the age, Hitchcock urges us to find our hope in a God who will not forsake us--no matter what cataclysms we experience on earth.From the Hardcover edition.

Until Maddie comes back to town. Maddie is the daughter of the former associate pastor of Joshua's church, and his childhood crush. Now Maddie is all grown up, gorgeous--and troubled. She wears provocative clothes to church, cusses, drinks, and fools around with older men. Joshua's ears burn just listening to the things she did to get kicked out of boarding school, and her own home.As time goes on, Josh goes against his parents and his own better instincts to keep Maddie from completely capsizing. Along the way, he begins to question his own rigid understanding of God and whether, as his mother says, a girl like Maddie is beyond redemption. Maddie leads Josh further astray than any girl ever has . . . but is there a way to reconcile his love for her and his love for his life in the church?From the Hardcover edition.

Godless: How an Evangelical Preacher Became One of America's Leading Atheists,Dan Barker,religion,First published in 2008,/works/OL15181914W?edition=ia%3Agodlesshowevange0000bark,/authors/OL828159A/Dan_Barker,//archive.org/services/img/godlesshowevange0000bark,Publish Date 2008|Publisher  Ulysses Press|Language English,"After 19 years as an evangelical preacher, missionary, and Christian songwriter, Dan Barker 'threw out the bathwater and discovered there is no baby there.' Barker, who is now co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation (America's largest organization of atheists and agnostics), describes the intellectual and psychological path he followed in moving from fundamentalism to freethought. The four sections in Godless--Rejecting God, Why I Am An Atheist, What's Wrong With Christianity, and Life is Good!--include chapters on bible problems, the historicity of Jesus, morality, the Kalam Cosmological argument, the unbelievable resurrection, and much more. Barker relates the positive benefits from trusting in reason and human kindness instead of living in fear of false judgment and moral condemnation. Godless expands the story told in Dan's 1992 book, Losing Faith in Faith--the two books overlap about 20%--but a lot has happened in 16 years, and Dan updates the story with four new chapters, including 'The New Call' (lessons from the debate circuit), 'Adventures in Atheism,' and 'We Go To Washington' (FFRF's Supreme Court lawsuit, in which Dan was a plaintiff).

Laughing Matters is a collection of stories that shows the difference between those who resign and those who rejoice when reality bites. Readers will be encouraged to choose joy, to find hope, and to discover the abundant life Christ offers all who follow Him. Author and humorist Phil Callaway--once described as ""Dave Barry with a message""--employs his revealing and hilarious style to remind readers that, ""it's always darkest just before the fridge door opens."" Do you resign or rejoice when reality bites?  Sometimes life just stinks. People disappoint. Bad things happen. Hardship comes in double helpings. The last thing you want to do is laugh. So let hilarious humorist Phil Callaway show you--as only he can--that some of the darkest times are those just before the fridge door opens.       ""Everything Phil Callaway writes is full of life because he's discovered a fabulous secret: The joy of Christ doesn't go away, even when life is a mess.""  Luis Palau  President of the Luis Palau Evangelistic Association  ""Phil really knows how to get in touch with his spiritual funny bone.""  Janette Oke  Bestselling author  ""One page into this book and I'm quaking with laughter. Callaway has the uncanny ability to uncover the funny in any situation and report it with inspirational wit.""  Paul L. Maier  Coauthor of The DaVinci Code: Fact or Fiction?  ""This book is an excellent source of encouragement for anyone in the midst of a crisis who may be asking God that hardest question of all: 'Why?'""  Martha Bolton  Author of Cooking with Hot Flashes and Didn't My Skin Used to Fit? Story Behind the BookPhil Callaway wrote this book after a five-year journey he and his wife embarked upon when she began having seizures. He discovered that when life throws you curve balls, juices lemons in your eyes, scrunches you in a knuckle sandwich...the last thing you want to do is laugh. And at the moment we realize that life can just plain stink, ""this book helps us know where to go from that point,"" he says. Celebrities like Dave Dravecky, Barbara Johnson, Gloria Gaither, and Joni Eareckson Tada have endorsed Callaway's positive approach to trials. ""Everything Phil Callaway writes is full of life because he's discovered a fabulous secret: The joy of Christ doesn't go away, even when life is a mess,"" says evangelist Luis Palau.From the Trade Paperback edition.

Some of the defeated rebels fled to Earth, becoming the bene elohim. There they raised mortal kingdoms. Avenging shining ones followed, and for a thousand years war raged. In the end, the shining ones dragged the bene elohim off Earth and chained them within Stygian prisons.  But the Nephilim remained. They were the offspring of the bene elohim and mortal women. By studying ancient scripts, the Nephilim discovered a way to regain dominion over the Earth.  The ancient war was reborn.   The Nephilim had a plan. They would storm Eden, defeat the guardian Cherub with his flaming sword and eat from the Tree of Life. Then they would rule the Earth as immortal gods.   First, they needed armor to resist the flaming sword. Second, they needed a weapon to kill an angel. And third, they had to forge a champion capable of this feat. Their quest could unleash terrible forces upon the Elder Earth, but they were the sons of fallen angels and they would trample anyone who dared to stand in their way.  GIANTS is the start of the saga of the war between Nephilim and men in the days before the oceans overran the Pre-Cataclysmic World. GIANTS is a novel by Vaughn Heppner.
