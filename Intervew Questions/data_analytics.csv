"Phone Interview #2

You are playing a game of baseball. There are two outs in the bottom of the ninth, and you are down by one run. You are currently a baserunner on first base. [Obviously, you must score or else the game ends].

A)You are trying to figure out if you should steal second base or not. What kind of information do you need to know to inform this decision?

B) Every batter in your lineup has identical odds.They get a single 50% of the time and they strike out 50% of the time. If you are on first base, you cannot score on a single. If you are on second, you are guaranteed to score on a single. You successfully steal 75% of the time. Should you steal?
[I may be missing some of the nonsense here, but this is all the relevant information]

C) It turns out the pitcher acts a bit differently with a runner on second [regardless of who the batter is] and no other runners on base. Under these circumstances, he is 50% to strike them out, 40% to surrender a walk, and 10% to surrender a hit.

Sql:
find the highest salary per department
Select employee from departments where max salary of the department is 40k

Select employee which have the max salary in a given department
Select employee with second highest salary

Face To Face Rounds (Fullstack):
To begin I was asked about different metrics which could be reported given the dataset/information or scenario. Then interviewer picked up a metrics and asked to draw on whiteboard what kind of graph/chart will I use to display the information. Then going further asked about the table structures and data model which will be required to support the dashboard. Interviewer then provided the initial data set which is 1 case was a log file and in another some detail level tables,  I was asked to write a programming code to read, parse and load data to tables.

"In War Commander, you can produce units to join your army. Your army can hold a maximum of 100 units. Units cost time to build, and are produced individually by adding them to a build queue. Alternatively, you can spend gold to skip the wait for each unit produced. Gold is purchased with USD.

After units are built, you can use them to attack other player bases, and any damaged units are added to a repair queue that works in the same way as the build queue (repairs cost time and can be accelerated with gold).

Your product manager wants to increase the maximum number of units in your army from 100 to 150.  Please answer these questions to help inform whether the unit increase is a good or bad idea:

●	What data would you use to estimate the impact increasing units will have on revenue?
●	How will increasing the maximum number of units change player behavior?
●	What metrics might change related to unit production, repairs, and attacks?
●	Is increasing the number of units a good idea?

"Though I didn't not get the offer I would like point out the seamless interview process and one of good HR I have come across. 1 HR - The HR was very welcoming and asked questions based on shared resume. explained what is expected out of this job role and shared general interview process and timelines and guided for next round 2 Hiring Manager : Again a very good human being. I explained my past projects with STAR method and what I can contribute to this role with my current skillset and he also had some situational based questions, some product analysis questions 3. Hacker Rank : The interviewer was very helpful and explained me the process and timeline for each questions, but the interview Qs were prepared based on interviewers experience (Python, AI and ML) 80% of the questions was having python coding and (Though I had mentioned I do not have hands on experience in python coding in my previous rounds and its in my resume too) the job description also mentioned other skill set like Data Management, Data visualization and AWS data lakes and ETL which was not even part of the interview as mentioned in the preparation mail shared by HR coordinator. though there were 1-2 questions surrounding SQL but the interviewer was not interested in spending more time on those Qs I can understand lack experience might be the reason for it. I tried explaining my thought process wherever I couldn't do python coding, Advice to Talent acquisition team: 1. If you are looking for a particular skillset then add it as must have for the job role and dont add 10 supporting skillset to the JD. 2. If team wants versatile candidate on the team then please make sure interviewer possesses similar skillset or have some knowledge about it.",Interviewed at Workday,3.9,Senior Product Data Analyst,13 Sept 2023,1

"Though I didn't not get the offer I would like point out the seamless interview process and one of good HR I have come across. 1 HR - The HR was very welcoming and asked questions based on shared resume. explained what is expected out of this job role and shared general interview process and timelines and guided for next round 2 Hiring Manager : Again a very good human being. I explained my past projects with STAR method and what I can contribute to this role with my current skillset and he also had some situational based questions, some product analysis questions 3. Hacker Rank : The interviewer was very helpful and explained me the process and timeline for each questions, but the interview Qs were prepared based on interviewers experience (Python, AI and ML) 80% of the questions was having python coding and (Though I had mentioned I do not have hands on experience in python coding in my previous rounds and its in my resume too) the job description also mentioned other skill set like Data Management, Data visualization and AWS data lakes and ETL which was not even part of the interview as mentioned in the preparation mail shared by HR coordinator. though there were 1-2 questions surrounding SQL but the interviewer was not interested in spending more time on those Qs I can understand lack experience might be the reason for it. I tried explaining my thought process wherever I couldn't do python coding, Advice to Talent acquisition team: 1. If you are looking for a particular skillset then add it as must have for the job role and dont add 10 supporting skillset to the JD. 2. If team wants versatile candidate on the team then please make sure interviewer possesses similar skillset or have some knowledge about it.",Interviewed at Workday,3.9,Senior Product Data Analyst,13 Sept 2023,1

"Scenario: 

There are thousands of support cases from the last couple of years from different support queues. Some of these cases are duplicates because of a tooling error. Cases have statuses of either new, open, or resolved. Cases can be handled by various tier level agents or transferred between them if a given agent can’t resolve it on their own. 

1) How would you count all the data in the database? 

2) How would you determine how many unique cases there are? 

3) How would you determine when the first case was created to when the last case was created and which case numbers are tied to these dates 

4) How would you determine the amount of days between when the first case was created and the last case was created? 

5) There’s a field that shows the agents email that is working each case. The email indicates whether the agent is part of Contracting A company or Contracting B company. How would you determine the number of cases with each contractor? 
agent_id --  agent_email
34234 -- john@contractor_a.com
34343 -- joe@contractor_b.com

6) How would you create a query where you exclude all cases that have “Test” in the subject? 

7) How would you join two fields together that are have different data types? For example, one field is a string and the other is a number

8) How would you query all cases that are either new or open? 

9) How could you fetch the first 5 characters of the customer’s name? 

10) What method would you use to group together queues to create a rollup field where similar queues are grouped together? 

11) How would you combine case number and case owner for a join to another table?

12) What are the requirements to execute a union and when would you use one? 

13) How would you get all the cases created in the last 3 months? 

14) How would you find the avg. time in days to resolve a case for each queue this current year? 

15) How would you find the cases that have duplicate records? 

16) What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses? 

17) Write a single query to calculate the sum of all positive values of x and the sum of all negative values of x. Looking for the function you would write 

18) How would you get the last case id without the max function? 

19) Can you tell me about a time when you had to think outside the box to get the job done?

20) When you don’t have enough information to get the job done, what do you do? (ex. if you don’t know how to write a particular query or don’t have enough background or aren’t familiar with the data set)",Interviewed at Coinbase,3.8,Data Analyst,17 Sept 2019,1

"Aedit is the first company that I have rejected immediately following the first interview.

There was no phone screen with an internal recruiter to confirm salary requirements or other basics. The executive who I met with became oddly defensive when I inquired about Aedit's relationship with Skafos -- an AI company. Normally, I am friendly and jovial during interviews, but I felt reticent with this person, which I attribute to being interrupted and corrected several times (yikes!). In addition, whereas the job posting states this role is a hybrid of data engineering, business analytics, and data science, it's fairly obvious that Aedit is, essentially, looking for a Reporting Analyst. In general, the conversation was incredibly awkward. In addition, it is difficult to find any state documentation on this company through online sources, which seems sketchy. Lastly, it seems like there is a high degree of turnover at this company.",Interviewed at AEDIT,4.0,BI Data Analyst,14 Jul 2020,1

Both sold $6,000,000 last year, while the cost of goods sold for Slurp was $4,000,000 versus $2,000,000 for Cola.

The delivery expense last year was equal at $2,400,000 each, while other expenses were $600,000 each, giving a final net income of -$1,000,000 for Slurp and $1,000,000 for Cola.

"100MM Revenue Company is a computer hardware distributor.  They solely work as a middleman between wholesaler and customer.  They have gross transaction costs of 80 MM and 2 offices with expenses totaling 20MM (10MM each) and 20MM in sales costs. 

Are they Profitable?
If not, what are some options they may have to become profitable?

For every additional $1 of revenue, the company has $0.90 costs.  How much must they raise revenue to break-even?

Is this a reasonable solution? Why or why not?

20MM in sales related costs.  70% goes to vendor costs and 30% to salesperson travel expenses, etc.

Current vendor costs 50% more than industry standard.  How much would the company save going to new vendor?

Current industry sales per saleperson is 33% higher than current salespeople.  How much could they save if they wanted to cut down number of salespeople with industry standard versions to maintain 100MM revenue?

With the reduction in sales costs are they profitable?  Why or why not?  What if they close one of the offices to lower office expenses?  How much must they now produce in revenue to break-even? (use break even equation as we did earlier)

Finally manager comes to you and says “we want to make our profits to be 3% of our revenue”.  How can you make this happen?

Quizno's is performing a survey by asking people coming out of their restaurant whether they like the food and if they'd recommend it. Are there any problems with this approach, and how would you fix it?

Take home assessment is a three hour timed assignment, they will email it to you and you have to turn it back in 3 hours from then.  Full text is below:

Retail  store  X  is  looking  for  help  in  determining  the  effectiveness  of  some  recent  campaigns  and
advice  on  how  to  move  forward.  Their  brand  favorability  has  taken  a  hit  in  recent  news  coverage
due  to  a  security  breach  and  their  own  store  brand  products  have  been  on  a  steady  decline  with
a  more  intense  drop  recently.  In  an  effort  to  remedy  the  situation,  the  store  has  decided  to
implement  the  following  campaigns: 
● An  instore  promotion  of  “every  $50  spent  on  store  brand  products  receives  a  $5  gift  card
to  the  store”  to  run  from  Jan  1,  2018  to  March  1,  2018 
● An  addressable  TV  ad  campaign  focused  on  positive  impact  to  the  community  to  run
from  February  1,  2018  to  April  15,  2018
Now  that  the  campaigns  have  terminated,  retail  store  X  would  like  to  know:   
● What  impact,  if  any,  did  the  campaigns  have? 
● Did  brand  favorability  change  about  retail  store  X? 
● Given  the  possible  impact  of  these  campaigns,  what  suggestions  would  you  give  the
client  for  increasing  their  ROI  and  public  opinion  moving  forward?  The  client  has
provided  the  following  datasets: 
Total  person  level  spend  data  by  week  for  retail  store  X 
● Addressable  TV  ad  assignments  indicating  those  who  will  receive  the  TV  ad  (“1”)  and
those  who  will  not  receive  the  TV  ad  (“0”) 
● Pre-campaign  survey  data  collected  between  Dec  1,  2017  -  Dec  23,  2017
● Post-campaign  survey  data  collected  between  May  1,  2018  -  May  15,  2018
● Demographic  person  data
● Dates
You  are  tasked  with  answering  the  client’s  questions  to  the  best  of  your  ability  within  3  hours.
Please  provide  insight  as  to  your  rationale  and  assumptions  made  where  appropriate.  You  are
not  required  to  create  deliverable  client  reports  but  please  include  a  client-facing  appropriate
explanation  for  each  question  asked.
Due  to  time  constraints,  please  prioritize  what  can  be  completed  and  if  you  are  not  able  to  finish
the  whole  test,  please  include  a  write  up/detailed  outline  of  what  you  would  have  done  given

Our evaluation process involves multiple factors and considerations, and we are unable to disclose detailed results or feedback. i know that by law they are not obliged but as it was a very specific test i was very curious to check why i failed. at least i should have been informed before the test that it was not a standard language test. this is not that i ABSOLUTELY wanted t work for them but just a matter of professionalism.",Interviewed at Dataforce,3.0,french speaking data analyst,6 Jun 2023,0

They gave me a string manipulation software engineering question and told me I had to verbally tell them how to solve the problem, but told me I wasn't allowed to use any existing Python packages. Not sure what the purpose of that was - it definitely didn't have anything to do with data analysis. I also had to stop and ask them multiple times if I was understanding because they didn't have it written out. They just pulled up an Excel Sheet titled 'Book 1' (which means they just created it), with a single sentence in the 'A' column - one letter per column.
