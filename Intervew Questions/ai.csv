"Question: Moving Average Anomaly Detection
Problem: You are given a time series data of daily stock prices in the form of an array prices, where each prices[i] represents the stock price on day i. Implement a function that detects anomalies using a simple moving average (SMA) approach.

An anomaly is detected if the stock price deviates from the moving average by more than a certain threshold. Given the list prices, an integer window_size, and a threshold percentage, return a list of days (indices) where anomalies are detected.

Input:

prices: List of integers representing stock prices over time.
window_size: Integer representing the number of days to compute the moving average.
threshold: Float representing the percentage deviation from the moving average to be considered an anomaly.
Output: A list of indices where anomalies are detected.",Interviewed at Google,4.3,AI/ML Engineer,5 Nov 2024,0

You are tasked with building a development environment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for a new web application. This environment needs to include:
- A virtual machine (VM) instance.
- A PostgreSQL database instance for the application's data storage.
- Secure access to the VM instance via SSH.
Requirements:
- Use Terraform to define and provision the infrastructure.
- The Postgres database instance should be accessible by the VM instance but not directly exposed to the public internet. Utilize Google Cloud's security best practices.
Bonus points:
- Can you configure the Terraform code to use environment variables for sensitive information like the GCP project ID or zone?
- Can you modify the code to allow SSH access only from specific IP addresses for enhanced security?",Interviewed at Cloudwerx,4,AI/ML Engineer,6 Apr 2024,0

"For the purpose of the following discussion topics, assume that we have access to the
following 3 types of documents:
1. Law articles: ground-truth for the law in The Netherlands
2. Case law: past details and rulings from various courts on real cases including
facts and circumstances.
3. Commentaries: interpretations and opinions of experts on particular law
articles, legal concepts and/or jurisprudence
Discussion topic 1: Domain-Specific Re-ranking Model
Outline your approach to developing a re-ranking model customized for the legal
domain. Assume you have access to a high quality varied index of legal documents and
a retriever that returns a set of N such documents.
Example questions:
- How would you go about collecting, processing and annotation of data?
- What types of features/metadata could be particularly useful for re-ranking in a
legal context?
- How would you train the reranker?
- How would you evaluate the reranker?

Discussion topic 2: Improving a RAG pipeline with legal domain knowledge
Our Retrieval Augmented Pipeline has challenges that are particular to the legal
domain. For instance, there are regulations that might be outdated (without this being
clear from the metadata), or a precendent that has been overruled.
Think about more potential failure cases a legal RAG pipeline is especially susceptible
to, and what experiments you would do to solve these problems. If you can’t come up
with extra failure cases, use our examples.",Interviewed at Sdu,3.8,AI Engineer,8 Feb 2024,0

"This was my favorite interview during my job search. It was a good mix of experience-based, knowledge-based, coding, and design questions. It definitely was not easy, but the reason I liked it so much was that it did not include solving annoying coding ""puzzles"" in which some secret algorithm is the answer. Instead, it was more focused on overall design. Even the coding questions were more of the type ""please write some code to design me a class that would carry out this functionality for this example use case"". Overall, the questions felt more like real engineering and casual conversation about design, rather than the interviewer sitting there in silence as you try to decipher a puzzle.",Interviewed at NVIDIA,4.5,AI Infrastructure Engineer,13 Apr 2022,0

He straight away told me ""I am not interested in candidates like you"" and ended the interview in a rude and unprofessional way. The interviewer showed no interest in my background or experience, and seemed more interested in showing off their own knowledge and intelligence. It was a power trip, plain and simple. I left the interview feeling completely demoralized and disrespected. It's a shame that a company would allow someone like this to represent them in the hiring process.

"Machine Learning and AI Questions:
What is Gradient Descent?Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the gradient.
Name Some Python Libraries for Machine Learning/AI: Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Name Some Machine Learning Models:Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformer Models.
What is a Transformer?A transformer is a deep learning model architecture designed to handle sequential data, most often used in NLP tasks like translation or text generation.
What is Attention in Transformers?Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, which helps transformers process and understand relationships between words or tokens more efficiently.
What is Distributed Training?Distributed training involves training machine learning models across multiple machines (or nodes) to handle large-scale data and computationally intensive tasks.
What is Model Parallelism?Model parallelism splits a large machine learning model across multiple GPUs or machines to reduce memory constraints during training.
What is Data Parallelism?Data parallelism involves distributing the data across different processing units and performing computations on different portions of data simultaneously, but the model stays the same across all units.
Difference Between Parallel and Distributed Computing:Parallel computing executes multiple tasks simultaneously on the same machine.
Distributed computing involves running computations across multiple machines or nodes.
What is LangChain? Likely refers to LangChain, a framework used to develop applications that integrate with language models. It provides abstractions and tools for managing inputs, outputs, and workflows in LLM applications.
How Do You Train an Image Model with Limited Compute/Storage?
Solution: Use techniques like model pruning, model quantization, or transfer learning. You can also use cloud services with large compute instances or leverage distributed training on multiple GPUs.
What is a GPU and When Do We Use It?A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is optimized for parallel processing, and it’s used in machine learning tasks like training deep neural networks for faster computations.
Difference Between CPU and GPU?CPU: General-purpose processor optimized for sequential tasks.GPU: Specialized for parallel tasks, like matrix multiplication, making it ideal for ML tasks.
How Does a Neural Network Work?A neural network is a system of interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) where each node processes inputs and applies weights and biases before passing output to the next layer. It ""learns"" by adjusting these weights using backpropagation during training.
What is Autoregression in Text Mining?Autoregression models predict the next word or value in a sequence based on previous data points, commonly used in time series and NLP tasks.

Cloud and Security Questions:
What is Security and Layers of Security?Security in the cloud involves multiple layers, including network security, application security, identity management, and data protection (e.g., encryption).
How to Move Data Safely Between Storages?Use encrypted transfer protocols like HTTPS or SFTP. AWS services such as S3 Transfer Acceleration or AWS DataSync can help.
What Databases Have You Worked With?Examples could include Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift.
What is a Data Lake?A data lake is a centralized repository that stores large amounts of raw, structured, or unstructured data, which can be processed and analyzed later.
Three-Layer Architecture?Presentation Layer, Application Layer, and Data Layer, used to separate concerns and scale applications more easily.
Migration 7R’s?Retire, Retain, Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Repurchase, Rebuild—strategies for migrating applications to the cloud.
How to Check Security and Access Levels?Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies and roles, conduct regular audits, and use services like AWS CloudTrail for logging access and activities.
How to Ensure Data Availability/Reliability?Use multi-region or multi-AZ deployments, implement auto-scaling, perform backups, and monitor health with services like CloudWatch.
What is Cloud Compute?Cloud compute refers to virtual servers and services (e.g., EC2, AWS Lambda) that provide scalable compute power without managing physical infrastructure.
Pros and Cons of Serverless Computing?Pros: No infrastructure management, automatic scaling, cost-efficient.
Cons: Limited control, cold-start issues, less flexibility for complex workloads.
Example of Serverless Computing:AWS Lambda functions triggered by S3 uploads, API Gateway requests, etc.

"1. Highly Profitable Months

The stocks of a company are being surveyed to analyze the net profit of the company over a period.

For an analysis parameter 
�
k, an interval of 
�
k consecutive months is said to be highly profitable if the values of the stock prices are strictly increasing for those months. Given the stock prices of the company for 
�
n months and the analysis parameter 
�
k, find the number of highly profitable intervals.

Example

stockPrices = [5, 3, 5, 7, 8]
�
=
3
k=3

These are the intervals of 
�
k months in which the stock prices are strictly increasing:

[Visual representation of the intervals in a bar graph]

Hence the answer is 2.

Note: If the interval length is 1, each subarray of length 1 is highly profitable
