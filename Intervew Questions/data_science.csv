"Data challenge was very similar to the ads analysis challenge on the book the collection of data science takehome challenge, so that was easy (if you have done your homework).

SQL was: you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count. It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has listened to a given song. So count is cumulative sum.
You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records in real time when a user listens to a given song. Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first table that has the lifetime count. 
If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there and then add the count of the last day.

"Consider a game with 2 players, A and B. Player A has 8 stones, player B has 6. Game proceeds as follows. First, A rolls a fair 6-sided die, and the number on the die determines how many stones A takes over from B. Next, B rolls the same die, and the exact same thing happens in reverse.

"1. Given an empty BST consist of n nodes and and an array consist of n numbers.
The n nodes in a BST have been already arranged in some fashion(i.e. the BST is not empty), and none of the nodes in BST are having any data, that means we have to pick the n numbers from the given array and have to fill in the given BST.
 We have to make sure that the structure of the BST doesn't change. That means all the left subtree and right subtree at any given node should not change at all.

"It was a general purpose call, including some introduction, talking about the company, general HR questions followed by a few technical discussion & explaining my background for the role.
The 30 min call went pretty well, and  the interviewer (the CEO) mentioned that it was just an introductory call, and it went pretty well as she was genuinely interested in my research work and ideas on their current projects. She went on to thoroughly describe the actual selection process that will soon follow and that I should start preparing for the same. 
However, they ghosted me after that and I never heard back from them( at the time of writing this it has been 3+ weeks).
It was really hypocritical l, considering the CEO spends half her time on LinkedIn and is quite active. She posts a lot about malpractises in the industry & technical hiring processes, the bias and sexism. However when it came to showing some common professional courtsey she chose not to write a short message which takes no time at all.",Interviewed at Alectio,1.4,Applied Data Scientist,1 Apr 2021,1

I) Conditional probability dice questions:
a) Expected pay-off of a single roll single dice game (Entry fee $3). The amount the player gets is the face value of the dice. Ans: $3.5 - $3 = $0.5
b) Expected pay-off of a double roll single dice game(entry fee $4). Rule: the player can either hold or continue the game after the first roll. If the player continues the player forfeits the money received after the first round.Ans. $4.25(Expected values check stack overflow for the math) - $4 = $0.25

c) Which of a) or b) has a higher payoff. Ans. obviously game (a).

Another cost, the cost of service that the company bears is $50, which is taken from customer while making the deal.

"There were two rounds in ISRO.
1st is written test which is nothing but just for the screening purpose.
Interview was quite conceptual. The very first difference I'd like to clear about between the private companies and government PSUs interview is that for private your focus should be more on programming and for government your focus should be more on concepts. At a time both are necessary.

My interview duration was approx 55 min. There were 6 Senior Scientists in the interviewee panel. Each one of them was an specialist of a particular subject.
Firstly, they asked me to introduce myself. As I've done my B.Tech. in CSE in 2011 so it took me bit long time to tell them about what I've done till now. And ultimately that made them curious about my profile as I've done CDAC certification (from gov institute) from BLR. After that I served an IT company (CGI Info Systems) for 2.2 yrs., n Currently I'm pursuing M.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Patna.

After that they asked me my favorite 4 subjects. So I replied
OS
Networking
Maths
DS

After that they came to operating system and asked various questions from process and semaphore.
Difference between process and threads.
Difference between mutex and semaphore?
In how many context u can differentiate them?
For both questions first I explained basic differences then I explained from the perspective of implementation (in both windows and Linux). Then I told them how do they cleaned up in the system and also explained efficiency wise which one is better with their pros and cons.


Networking
Why TTL is there? What are it's values for different different systems like for windows, Linux, router?
Working of traceroute command? 
It's answer is quite tricky, u can find on internet.
How to set up router? 
This was from my previous company experience as I have mentioned networking related work in my last job experience.
How routing table set up works?

Now they started asking questions from M.Tech. What have you learned in your M.Tech. I told them only those subjects in which I  was comfortable. They asked some simple questions from those subjects like what you have learnt in machine learning, where can you apply this and so on. 
My M.tech project was based on Formal Methods (semantic based procedure to find out the query similarity)
They have done so many cross questions on my approach of finding query similarity. For some I defended very well but for some I couldn't make them more clear.
 
At last they started asking questions from high school maths. They asked me geometry, this is the only section where I couldn't answer anything. 
Question:
Draw two circles side by side and then draw tangent touching both the circles making an angle of 90 in between. Now what will be the equation to represent this.

Then I request them to ask me math questions from GATE. Then they asked me linear algebra questions which I could answer after taking some seconds but not immediately.
So overall experience was good.
All the very best which you too can make!!","Interviewed at Government of India, Department of Space, Indian Space Research Organisation",4.2,Scientist,28 Jan 2018,1

To do this, I was provided with a CSV file with about 10 rows of data. There was no instruction or data dictionary provided, however, it seemed that each ""contract"" was bid on by multiple ""participants"" and the winner was chosen (as per the instructions) as the participant with the lowest bid offer.

That means each ""participants"" field contained a list... important to notice though it wasn't explained at all in the instructions where the winner price was chosen from - that was left for the reader to decipher.",Interviewed at Vamstar,3.4,Data Scientist,9 May 2024,1

"1. Started with a detailed explanation of a past project - what was the business question, how did you come up with the solution, what was your hypothesis, how did you design the A/B test, why did you make certain choices, what was the result etc. Prepare 1-2 examples from your past, where you can talk in depth about the technical elements of your project.

2. Let's say we have a dataset with attributes for a house (Sq footage, locality etc) and house price. How will you predict the house price from these attributes? (Build a multiple regression model) 

3. For this multiple regression model, explain the end-to-end process. What steps will you take before building the model, how will you impute missing values, how will you handle outliers etc. What are the underlying assumptions of a regression model?

4. Once the model is built, how will you infer the relationship (sign and magnitude) between the house attributes and house price. How will you explain it to someone that's not a technical person?

5. For the regression coefficients, how will you interpret them, (p-values, confidence interval etc). How will you explain a p-value to a layman

6.  Next question was about ""how will you segment customers"" in order to serve a business requirement, such as determining which customers to show a given ad (I answered with clustering, because the business problem wasn't very specific, he just described it very generally)

7. For clustering, how does it work, how to choose the value of K in k-means. I also said we can use Gaussian mixture models for clustering, which he didn't seem to know because he asked me to clarify what I mentioned.

There might have been a few more questions that I don't remember, but the theme of the interview was to check how well you know the basics of Stats/ML. I believe I answered most of the questions correctly so to receive the feedback that I wasn't up to the mark technically seemed like a case of Google not wanting to reveal the real reason, whatever it was. 

Either way, make sure you confirm the format of the interview with the recruiter. Because I was already interviewing with other companies, I had brushed up on my Stats/ML basics, but you might not be as lucky. Good luck!",Interviewed at Google,4.3,Marketing Data Scientist,19 Nov 2020,1

"In order to push existing users to refer their friends, we're running a special reward program, in
which the user is given an instant $10 discount for posting a referral message as their Facebook
status. The message looks something like this:
""Check out this company Jerry.ai --they automatically checks if you’re paying the lowest price
for insurance and they will also find the best quote for you. As a friend of mine, you can get $20
off your insurance purchase. Click here to get the $20 gift credit: jerry.ai ""
The user is given the option to post this message on his/her Facebook account during the
purchase. Once they post this message, they instantly get the $10 discount on their purchase.
In other words, we don't wait for any of their referred friends to actually signup with us before
giving them the discount. We feel that doing this would make the users more likely to post the
referral message.
Assume that this reward program has been running for a couple of months, and we have some
data collected in our database. We want to know if running this program has been a good idea
or not, i.e., are we acquiring new customers with it, or are we just losing money by giving out
$10 discounts.
Assume that you have the following database tables: 'User' and Purchase'
Table User
id, name, referring_user_id
Table Purchase
id, user_id, date, total, discounts
In the Purchase table, the 'total' field contains the dollar amount of the job. The 'discounts' field
consists of the total discounts given for the appointment (including rewards, coupon
redemptions, etc.). Therefore, the customer pays: 'total' - 'discounts' as their final bill.
Given this data:
1) 'What' information would you derive from it, and 'how' will you derive it (you can give SQL
queries, pseudo code, ... whatever you're comfortable with)
2) Using the information from Step 1), how would you make a recommendation on whether this
rewards program should be continued or discontinued",Interviewed at Jerry,3.7,Data Scientist,28 Apr 2021,1

The user is given the option to post this message on his/her Facebook account during the
purchase. Once they post this message, they instantly get the $10 discount on their purchase.
In other words, we don't wait for any of their referred friends to actually signup with us before
giving them the discount. We feel that doing this would make the users more likely to post the
referral message.
Assume that this reward program has been running for a couple of months, and we have some
data collected in our database. We want to know if running this program has been a good idea
or not, i.e., are we acquiring new customers with it, or are we just losing money by giving out
$10 discounts.
Assume that you have the following database tables: 'User' and Purchase'
Table User
id, name, referring_user_id
Table Purchase
id, user_id, date, total, discounts
In the Purchase table, the 'total' field contains the dollar amount of the job. The 'discounts' field
consists of the total discounts given for the appointment (including rewards, coupon
redemptions, etc.). Therefore, the customer pays: 'total' - 'discounts' as their final bill.
Given this data:
1) 'What' information would you derive from it, and 'how' will you derive it (you can give SQL
queries, pseudo code, ... whatever you're comfortable with)
2) Using the information from Step 1), how would you make a recommendation on whether this
rewards program should be continued or discontinued",Interviewed at Jerry,3.7,Data Scientist,28 Apr 2021,1

"SQL A/B testing question: 
Q: You are tasked to analyze an experiment called thanksgiving-coupon. Instacart users in this experiment are randomly assigned to “incentive” group or “nonincentive” group. Users in the “incentives” group get an email with $10 off for their next order, and users in the “no incentives” group get an email reminding them to stock up groceries for the Thanksgiving weekend. The $10 off coupon expires on 11/29/2020 (Sunday) 11:59pm PST.

How would you analyze this experiment?

You have the table Experiments, which contains experiment assignments for Instacart users. Fields: user_id experiment: experiment name group_ind: experiment group a user is assigned to assigned_at_utc: assignment timestamp.

You also have the Orders table, which contains all orders from a user. 
Fields: user_id 
order_id 
order_created_timestamp_utc

Problem

I want to target ads at Twitter users. I’d like to start by identifying tweets which reflect Purchase Intent. I have access to the Twitter firehose. For each tweet with Purchase Intent, I would like to infer the specific item to which such intent applies.

Examples
Luke Sargent ‏@lsargent02 ""Still waiting for the A7s I want a camera that is small enough for me to carry around all the time.”

"This should be completed in no more than 3 hours.

1. When would I use a Python dictionary to store data, instead of another data structure?

Python Dictionary can be used to store data when the data consist of key-value pairs . It also helps in data lookups.

2. When writing Python code, why would you write a function?

Functions are define for the purposes of computations and code re-usability

3. I have a Python list named mylist. What is the difference between `sorted(mylist)` and `mylist.sort()`?

With sorted(mylist) : Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.
And with mylist.sort() : Returns None because it is not iterable.


4. I have a Pandas DataFrame named users. One of the Series is named age. I run this code: `users[users.age > 25]`. What does this code return, and how does it ""work""?
 
The code selects the ages column and filter out all ages greater than 25 based on the users DataFrame object.

5. What is the difference between a bar plot and a histogram?
 
Histogram shows the distributions of some variables whiles bar plot is used to compare variables with respect to a certain descriptive statistics.


6. What is the difference between regression and classification problems, and how can you convert a regression problem into a classification problem?
 
Regression problem is the one that predicts some continuous variable whiles classification problem is the one that predicts some binary or multi-class variable. You can convert a regression problem into a classification problem by adding a binary or multi-class response variable to the independent variables. But if you decide not to add a binary or multi-class response variable you can apply clustering technique like Kmeans on the data to make it a classification problem.

7. When Netflix predicts the number of stars that you will use to rate a movie, are they solving a regression or classification problem?
 
They are solving a classification problem since the ratings are in the range of 1-5 stars.

8. What's wrong with training and testing a machine learning model on the same data?
 
It is important not to test the prediction of an estimator on the data used to fit the estimator as this would not be evaluating the performance of the estimator on new data. This is why datasets are often split into train and test data.

9. What is the purpose of model evaluation procedures that ""hold out"" data, like train/test split and cross-validation?
 
The purpose of the “hold out” like train/test split is used to prevent the introduction of bias into the model and hence Over-Fitting.


10. What are a few metrics (single numbers) I might use to evaluate how well a regression model is doing?
 
R-Square, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Median Absolute Error

11. Why is a confusion matrix useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier?
 
The diagonal elements represent the number of points for which the predicted label is equal to the true label, while off-diagonal elements are those that are mislabeled by the classifier. The higher the diagonal values of the confusion matrix the better, indicating many correct predictions. It also helps to determine the True positives, False Negative, True Negative etc.

12. I built a machine learning model to solve a binary classification problem. The accuracy of my classifier is 99%, and the AUC is 0.51. Is my model doing well? Why or why not?

The model is not doing well because the AUC is about 0.51, which means that the classifier is not able to differentiate between the labels, hence a random classifier. The higher the AUC, the better the model and vice versa. However, the AUC is computed with the prediction scores specified as a parameter in the AUC method.
 
13. With regard to machine learning models, why should I care the about bias-variance trade-off?
 
We should care because bias introduces under-fitting into the model whiles variance introduces over-fitting into the model, so we need to worry about this issue so that our model can generalize well to unseen data.

14. How does regularization reduce overfitting?
 
Regularization reduce over-fitting by penalizing the parameters in the model as a result of using L1 or L2 penalty regularization terms. When we add a regularization term to the loss function, we shrink the weights a little, increasing the bias while reducing variance.


15. What are a few advantages and disadvantages of decision trees, as compared to other machine learning models?
 
Advantages of Decision Trees:

"The first round was with HR, which went for 30 min. Before the HR interview, the recruiter asked me to send an email explaining my experience with Python, R, SQL, ML – regression, classification, decision trees, xgboost, random forest, gradient boosting, ensemble learning, Deep learning, Neural Networks, NLP, SAS, Java, forecasting etc.  She also asked me to describe 2 projects i had worked on. I thought sending all these through email was really weird.  After the HR call,  I got informed about the second round the same day. The second round was with a Data Scientist, which went on for 45 min. Questions included basic SQL and ML. The second round was conducted by an inexperienced employee who asked me to write a SQL code over the phone with no screen sharing. The questions were easy, but coding without sharing the screen can be confusing.  The interviewer was so unprofessional and unprepared, she wasn't even sure what role she was interviewing me for and  didn't have my updated resume.

"You need to complete the take-home assignment within 72 hours. You can only send a PDF, if you want to send them your code, you have to embed it within the PDF. All other companies I've interviewed with want you to send them your code.

Compared to those other companies' assignments, Airbnb's was much more on the statistical side, hypothesis testing mostly.

I took time off from work to complete this assignment and ended up spending about 20 hours over the course of 3 days. When I've put that much work and energy into an assignment, I've always passed. 

Airbnb took over a week to respond to my submission, where I had to follow up with unresponsive recruiters.

When the answer finally came, it was a canned rejection email. I requested feedback that would help me do better next time. They never replied. 

After this experience, I don't want to interview with them for another position, nor recommend this company to anyone on my network.

"Each day a quarry-worker is given a pile of stones and told to reduce the larger stones into smaller ones. The worker must smash the stones together to reduce them, and is told to always pick up the largest two stones and smash them together. If the stones are of equal weight, they both disintegrate entirely. If one is larger, the smaller one is disintegrated and the larger one is reduced by the weight of the smaller one. Eventually, there is either one stone left that cannot be broken, or all of the stones have been smashed. Determine the weight of the last stone, or return O if there is none.

Example
weights = [1,2,3,6,7,7].
The worker always starts with the two largest stones. In this case, the two largest stones have equal weights of 7 so they both disintegrate when smashed. Next the worker smashes weights
3 and 6. The smaller one is destroyed and the larger weighs 6 - 3 = 3 units. Then, weights 3 and
2 are smashed together, which leaves a stone of weight 1. This is smashed with the last remaining stone of weight 1. There are no stones left, so the remaining stone weight is 0.

Function Description
Complete the function lastStoneWeight in the editor below. The function must return an integer that denotes the weight of the last stone, or 0 if all stones shattered into dust.
lastStoneWeight has the following parameter(s):
int weights[n]: an array of integers indicating the weights of each stone

"Tax Basis
It's tax season! Given a set of transactions, find out the cost basis for each sell and compute the overall capital gain/loss. The cost basis for a sold equity is the price at which the equity being sold was bought at.

You are provided with a sorted list of tuples, each of which represent a transaction. These tuples are formatted as follows: (date: int, symbol: string, side: string (buy/sell), quantity: int, price: float).
For each sell, output the following information: (symbol: string, date_bought: int, date_sold: int, price_bought_at: float, price_sold_at, quantity: int, capital_gain: float). Finally, output the overall capital gain/loss.

Disclaimer: The material contained herein is for whimsical purposes only and does not constitute tax advice. Investors should consult with their own tax advisor or attorney with regard to their personal tax situation.

Part I

Use FIFO cost basis strategy

Example:

Input:
transactions = [
    {'date': 1, 'symbol': 'FB', 'side': 'buy', 'quantity': 1, 'price': 200.00},
    {'date': 3, 'symbol': 'AAPL', 'side': 'buy', 'quantity': 2, 'price': 100.00},
    {'date': 4, 'symbol': 'FB', 'side': 'sell', 'quantity': 1, 'price': 150.00},
    {'date': 6, 'symbol': 'AAPL', 'side': 'buy', 'quantity': 1, 'price': 150.00},
    {'date': 7, 'symbol': 'AAPL', 'side': 'sell', 'quantity': 1, 'price': 200.00},
    {'date': 8, 'symbol': 'AAPL', 'side': 'buy', 'quantity': 4, 'price': 210.00},
    {'date': 11, 'symbol': 'AAPL', 'side': 'sell', 'quantity': 4, 'price': 220.00},
]

Output:
[
    (symbol: 'FB', date_bought: 1, date_sold: 4, price_bought_at: 200.00, price_sold_at: 150.00, quantity: 1, capital_gain: -50.00),
    (symbol: 'AAPL', date_bought: 3, date_sold: 7, price_bought_at: 100.00, price_sold_at: 200.00, quantity: 1, capital_gain: 100.00),

"R1: You need to diagnose an error in the program:
The google maps team wants to understand whether dismiss rate is a reasonable metric to help understand user experience of a button in the app. The hypothesis is that, the higher the dismiss rate, the worse the user experience. Hence, they perform a simulation in the A/A comparison scenario. In the simulation, signal = all interactions on the button (click, dismiss, ignore, ...), and negative signal = dismiss.

"A strange disease has spread across the land, many people seem to be affected in a way that is yet to be understood: when they are in daylight, odd looking marks appears on their skin that appear like burning tissue. A drug company trying to understand this disease's mechanism of action sent data over to us. They took normal and lesion skin biopsies from healthy and disease individuals respectively, and performed whole genome RNA-seq profiling in order to identify and understand the disease at the gene expression level.

Analysis workflow
Load the data into R and make sure the count and annotation data are consistent with each other.
Filter the count data for lowly-expressed genes, using the strategy of your choice. For example: only keep genes with a CPM >= 1 in at least 75% samples, in at least one of the groups.
Assign the library-size normalized log-CPM data into an object from a suitable data structure/class. Save it as a binary file (.rda or .rds).
Generate basic plots of your choice to investigate its main properties and comment (library sizes, expression distribution densities per sample, PCA colored per group, etc.).
Based on the previous plots, look for the presence of outlier/mislabeled samples in this dataset. Try to identify and remove them from the downstream analysis.
Run a differential expression analysis to find genes whose expression is different in lesion vs. normal samples. This can be done according to your preference either on the count data or the normalized log-CPM data, using an appropriate statistical method.
Generate a volcano plot (x-axis is the effect size and y-axis is the p-value) for this analysis. The selected 100 most significant genes should be colored.
Re-write step 6. by wrapping it up into a single function that you implement -- and document:
arguments: the expression data, the sample annotations and the name of the group variable
return value: a data.frame of statistics of differential expression.
(bonus) Write a function that identifies the outlier(s) based on the expression data and group variable only.

2. Build a simple machine learning model in Python to predict a user’s probability of conversion. Please note: we’re not looking for anything complicated here — we’re more interested in how you build a model, which data you choose to train the model, and how you define your target variable. Please do not spend a lot of time obsessing over feature selection, feature engineering, or hyper parameter tuning.

Tell me projects you are working on,Interviewed at Rocket Travel,3.5,Data Scientist,18 Mar 2020,0
"The initial interview was difficult to schedule , it seemed as if they were juggling multiple candidates.  

For most normal companies hiring for DS roles , the HR round is hardly 30 min. and its over within 15-20 min., once they figure out the candidate is not lost scientist or a jerk. 

This first interview (1 hr duration) was pretty hectic with 3 questions about Decision trees, neural networks and something else. The HR had a template to evaluate you and move you to the next round . 

In the next round , its an interview with the HR Director and they would ask a lot of behavioral and other types of questions.

Then they gave a 3 day DS Challenge forecasting exercise to forecast a Google trends search term, which was ridiculous , considering that it was nothing close to real data and you really cannot ask a question.

Got a reject after about a week of submitting my challenge solution.

The hiring manager is the CEO and you don't even get to speak to him unless you have completed the DS exercise. That's really a waste of your time.

"Assume you have a loyalty rewards program, where every user who makes purchase earns 200% of their order amount as reward points and when users return the item - the 200% points based on the current price of the product are deducted. 

We suspect some users have realized a gateway where they buy the product at full price but return when it is at discounted price so they keep the net difference in points (the refund always refunds full order amount).

 If user does this accidently or if the impact is less than 5000 reward points then business wants to ignore but identify anyone who is abusing this - how will you identify such users based on last 6 months of order and refund data. How will you identify this in real time as new orders/refunds are processed.",Interviewed at NextBee Media,4.5,Data Scientist,19 Sept 2019,0

Assume you have internal email data as proxy for with whom a sales person is talking with - and you want to group the sales team members into these 3 buckets so that sales VP can have separate training session for each group that is personalized to their behavior change.

"We have extracted data for 200 pediatric asthma patients who have been

exposed to beta-2 agonist medications, either short-acting ones (SABAs) or long-
acting ones (LABAs) or both concomitantly (see attached spreadsheet). An

individual’s status is marked as “1” if she/he has experienced either tachyphylaxis

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyphylaxis ) or therapeutic non-efficacy (non-
response in terms of pulmonary function test FEV1, or in terms of continued

asthma-related emergency department or in-patient hospital episodes) during the
follow-up time interval. Approximately 31% of patients are like this. Patients are
marked as “0” if during follow-up the SABA and/or LABA medications remained
efficacious at standard on-label doses.
Create a statistical predictive model that incorporates all of the variables that are
statistically significant. You may need to transform one or more of the raw
variables. Given what is known about population-level regression models, how

"My friends said I could file a lawsuit against them yet I don't have time for legal engagement. If a U.S. citizen or permanent resident is qualified for the job then he or she should be hired, whether they want to apply for green card for their existing employee or not. That's what Equal Opportunity Employer means. I guess Dell does not comply with the federal labor regulation. Then one of my former coworker who is a U.S. citizen told me that he applied for a Process Engineer position at Dell and the manager told him that, within a week they received 2,000 applications  and most of them are from India. He then told me because most engineering jobs at Dell are occupied by Indian people who refer their Indian friends for engineering jobs at Dell every day. He also said, if you are not Indian, it is most likely you will not get an engineering job interview, not to mention a job offer. Apparently he is right because I am not Indian and my job interview with Dell was not real. I was used for them to test the market and benefit their green card process. There is no diversity at Dell engineering department. 99% of their engineers are Indian even though they website advocates diversity in their corporate culture. It was just a joke.

"My friends said I could file a lawsuit against them yet I don't have time for legal engagement. If a U.S. citizen or permanent resident is qualified for the job then he or she should be hired, whether they want to apply for green card for their existing employee or not. That's what Equal Opportunity Employer means. I guess Dell does not comply with the federal labor regulation. Then one of my former coworker who is a U.S. citizen told me that he applied for a Process Engineer position at Dell and the manager told him that, within a week they received 2,000 applications  and most of them are from India. He then told me because most engineering jobs at Dell are occupied by Indian people who refer their Indian friends for engineering jobs at Dell every day. He also said, if you are not Indian, it is most likely you will not get an engineering job interview, not to mention a job offer. Apparently he is right because I am not Indian and my job interview with Dell was not real. I was used for them to test the market and benefit their green card process. There is no diversity at Dell engineering department. 99% of their engineers are Indian even though they website advocates diversity in their corporate culture. It was just a joke. 

Also if you get rejected by Dell for one position then you will get rejected for any other position you apply afterwards, even though their rejection email says they encourage you to check out Dell career website frequently as new positions come up blah blah....

"A. Presentation on a technical topic of your choice (to a roomful of around 20 people, who will constantly ask you technical questions related to your presentation as you progress along)

B. Whiteboard Questions (with different sets of interviewers):

1. Given a random number generator randN() that generates integers between 1 <= x <= N write a function that generates a number between 1 <= y <= M such that each integer in the range [1, M] has an equal probability of selection. Note that both N and M are known in advance and M > N. You can only use randN() and cannot use any other random number generating function calls.

2. Say there is only one kitchen in your office that is shared by your team and another team. Both teams have 15 members each. Every morning exactly 30 apples can be found in the kitchen that anybody in your team or the other team can take but of course is not required to (which means there could potentially be some apples leftover in the kitchen at the end of the day). You suspect that the other team is taking more than its ""fair share"" of apples and you want to test this hypothesis. But you are not allowed to ask individuals how many apples they ate, even if they are from your team and you cannot observe who is taking the apples in the kitchen. How would you go about evaluating your initial hypothesis? Write down the test that you would use. 

3. You are given three stack data-strucures that ONLY support pop, push, and peek methods. One of the stacks contains 5 integers in arbitrary order. Write a program in your language of choice to create a sorted stack with lowest numbers at the bottom of the stack and (ideally) not using more than the 3 stacks provided.

4. You are presented with a rectangular surface (map-like), with friction and environmental data recorded at a limited number of arbitrary points in the surface. There are a number of key-points in the surface for which you need to calculate the friction value. [Note: These ""key points"" were spaced as if they were the points of intersection of grid-lines that sub-divided the total surface area into smaller squares]. How would you implement a KNN approach to estimate the friction values at the key points if you wanted a distributed/scalable solution. What is the ideal way to place the key points in the surface, i.e. how would you determine the distance/spacing between the key points? 

5. Difference between l1/l2 penalty (lasso vs. ridge); Why use elastic net rather than simply using L1? What is the manner in which L1 penalty ""drops"" a subset of correlated variables aka how does it ""choose"" which correlated variable(s) to drop?

6. Given Sum[(x_hat - x_i)^2] for i = i, 2,...,n what value of x_hat will minimize the expression given here?

7. Same as (6) but the expression is Sum[abs(x_hat - x_i)]? Justify/explain your answer.

8. What are the different ways to regularize neural networks?

9. Say there is a function that is fitting three distinct models (i.e. independently of each other) with 14 million different time series', each of time-length 'l', and generating future forecasts (the input and forecasts are overwhelmingly positive values but some can be negative). Given that you have limited computing resources, say 200 cores, what is the best way to distribute the task of performing this operation. You can either use Spark to show how it can be done or you can simply describe the algorithm to get it done. They will ask you follow-up questions on the run-time complexity of your chosen algorithm(s).

C. HR and Management Joint-Interview:

These were largely generic HR/Management type questions.

10. Why this company and this position?
11. What do you see yourself doing in the next 5 years?
12. Describe a situation where you had disagreement with team members / colleagues and how you resolved it.
13. What is your ideal work environment? What kind of managemenet style do you like?
14. Have you been in leadership positions? What was your management style?
15. Did you face a situation where one of your team members was not motivated at all? And how did you resolve the situation.

"I needed to calculate the return of an investment, based on two scenarios, and provide some analysis on what are the non-economical pros and cos of each approach.",Interviewed at Boston Consulting Group,4.2,Data Scientist,8 Dec 2018,1
Lists in R and operations realted to it.,Interviewed at Concentrix,3.9,Junior Data Scientist,2 Dec 2020,1
"A. Presentation on a technical topic of your choice (to a roomful of around 20 people, who will constantly ask you technical questions related to your presentation as you progress along)

B. Whiteboard Questions (with different sets of interviewers):

1. Given a random number generator randN() that generates integers between 1 <= x <= N write a function that generates a number between 1 <= y <= M such that each integer in the range [1, M] has an equal probability of selection. Note that both N and M are known in advance and M > N. You can only use randN() and cannot use any other random number generating function calls.

2. Say there is only one kitchen in your office that is shared by your team and another team. Both teams have 15 members each. Every morning exactly 30 apples can be found in the kitchen that anybody in your team or the other team can take but of course is not required to (which means there could potentially be some apples leftover in the kitchen at the end of the day). You suspect that the other team is taking more than its ""fair share"" of apples and you want to test this hypothesis. But you are not allowed to ask individuals how many apples they ate, even if they are from your team and you cannot observe who is taking the apples in the kitchen. How would you go about evaluating your initial hypothesis? Write down the test that you would use. 

3. You are given three stack data-strucures that ONLY support pop, push, and peek methods. One of the stacks contains 5 integers in arbitrary order. Write a program in your language of choice to create a sorted stack with lowest numbers at the bottom of the stack and (ideally) not using more than the 3 stacks provided.

4. You are presented with a rectangular surface (map-like), with friction and environmental data recorded at a limited number of arbitrary points in the surface. There are a number of key-points in the surface for which you need to calculate the friction value. [Note: These ""key points"" were spaced as if they were the points of intersection of grid-lines that sub-divided the total surface area into smaller squares]. How would you implement a KNN approach to estimate the friction values at the key points if you wanted a distributed/scalable solution. What is the ideal way to place the key points in the surface, i.e. how would you determine the distance/spacing between the key points? 

5. Difference between l1/l2 penalty (lasso vs. ridge); Why use elastic net rather than simply using L1? What is the manner in which L1 penalty ""drops"" a subset of correlated variables aka how does it ""choose"" which correlated variable(s) to drop?

6. Given Sum[(x_hat - x_i)^2] for i = i, 2,...,n what value of x_hat will minimize the expression given here?

7. Same as (6) but the expression is Sum[abs(x_hat - x_i)]? Justify/explain your answer.

8. What are the different ways to regularize neural networks?

9. Say there is a function that is fitting three distinct models (i.e. independently of each other) with 14 million different time series', each of time-length 'l', and generating future forecasts (the input and forecasts are overwhelmingly positive values but some can be negative). Given that you have limited computing resources, say 200 cores, what is the best way to distribute the task of performing this operation. You can either use Spark to show how it can be done or you can simply describe the algorithm to get it done. They will ask you follow-up questions on the run-time complexity of your chosen algorithm(s).

C. HR and Management Joint-Interview:

These were largely generic HR/Management type questions.

10. Why this company and this position?
11. What do you see yourself doing in the next 5 years?
12. Describe a situation where you had disagreement with team members / colleagues and how you resolved it.
13. What is your ideal work environment? What kind of managemenet style do you like?
14. Have you been in leadership positions? What was your management style?
15. Did you face a situation where one of your team members was not motivated at all? And how did you resolve the situation.
16. Would you consider a management position in the future?
17. Describe a work situation where you felt a technical skill lacking in your part or that you really wished you had.
18. Why did you decide to go to [college/university name]?
19. Thinking about [project in your resume], what was a very challenging scenario that you faced and how did you handle it.
20. Other than your past projects that we have already discussed, what other projects are you especially proud of and why? 
21. Do you already have offers from other companies?
22. How much time can we take to notify you of our decisions?
23. If you are hired, would you start straight away or would you need some time to make that decision?

"A prisoner's hat question:
Two prisoners are each given a hat. Each hat is either white or black, and both hats may or may not be of the same color. The prisoners can see each other's hat, but they cannot see their own. Each prisoner must guess the color of the hat on his/her own head. If both prisoners guess incorrectly, they are punished. Otherwise, they both go free. The prisoners cannot communicate after they view each other's hat, but they can devise a strategy beforehand for how to guess.
Question: Can the prisoners devise a strategy for guessing that gives them a better than random chance of going free? If so, what is that strategy?",Interviewed at Urban Engines,3.0,Data Scientist,24 Oct 2014,1

We are working with an external research firm who specializes in the application of artificial intelligence to forecasting prices of financial instruments. This firm has developed a proprietary system, called “4sight”, to forecast prices of certain instruments.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of their forecasting system, the vendor has sent us attached sample dataset. The dataset includes signal values generated by the 4sight system as well as historical prices for a well-known broad market ETF.

A Portfolio Manager has asked you to:

1.       Review the quality of the data, list any potential errors, and propose corrected values. Please list each quality check error and correction applied.

2.       Please analyze the signal’s effectiveness or lack thereof in forecasting ETF price, using whatever metrics you think are most relevant.

3.       (Extra credit) Write a 1-2 paragraph summary for the Portfolio Manager addressing your observations about the efficacy and believability of the product, and recommendation for next steps.
